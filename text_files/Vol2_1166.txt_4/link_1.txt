Description						Organic Babassu Oil
INCI Name: Orbignya Oleifera (Organic Babassu Oil)
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: BrazilPackaging: Drums, buckets, jugs, plastic jars
Description: White solid when cold, clear liquid when warm; mild to no odor
Applications: Skincare, Soap ManufacturingOrganic Babassu oil is a natural substitution to palm or coconut oil in your soap making process. If you are looking to create palm free soap, this is your oil!Babassu oil is extracted from fallen babassu fruit. Kernels are removed and the oil is processed to create a usable oil. Brazilians use organic babassu oil in many skincare products to help heal scars due to its high level of saturated fat.Babassu oil is naturally thicker at colder temperatures and starts getting softer at 76° F and hotter, just like coconut or palm oils. Our organic babassu oil is light cream to white in color and has almost no scent.You can use organic babassu oil in more than soap. It is an excellent addition to skin salves and creams, body lotions, scrubs and anything where you want to have a superb level of moisturizing properties. Try blending organic babassu, organic beeswax, organic tamanu oil and organic hemp seed oil for a highly moisturizing, high level healing salve.Organic babassu oil is up to 55% Lauric Acid, so an excellent alternative for your soap bars.Organic Babassu Oil is sold in 16-ounce plastic jar, 1- gallon (8 pounds) bucket, and 5-gallon (40 pounds) bucket sizes. Please email us directly for 55-gallon+ orders.Short Term Storage: Air tight container. Dark location. Cool room temperature.Long Term Storage: Removing air from storage container will delay oxidation and rancidity (may need to place in a smaller container). Refrigeration can extend shelf life.Best Used By: One year from date of purchase.Shelf Life Once Used in Manufacturing: One year from manufacturing date.CTFA name::Organic Babassu OilINCI Name::Orbignya OleiferaCOUNTRY OF ORIGIN::BrazilCAS NO::91078-92-1CERTIFICATES/GRADE::Organic, non-GMOSAPONIFICATION VALUE::248MELT POINT:24°C/76°FFLASH POINT:>228°C/>442.4°FMETHOD OF EXTRACTION::Expeller PressedPLANT PART USED::FleshINGREDIENT COMPOSITION::100% Organic Babassu OilpH::3.6 - 5.1VEGAN::YesGLUTEN FREE::YesALLERGEN::None knownFOOD GRADE::YesTESTED ON ANIMALS::Never
