Preface 


More than 1800 cosmetic and toiletry formulations are detailed in this book, 
based on information received from numerous industrial companies and other 
organizations. The data represent selections from manufacturers' descriptions 
made at no cost to, nor influence from, the makers or distributors of these 
materials. 

Only the most recent formulas have been included. It is believed that all of the 
trademarked raw materials listed are currently available, which will be of utmost 
interest to readers concerned with raw material discontinuances. 

Spurred by a strong economy, sales for the cosmetics and toiletry industry 
have been increasing at 6-7% annually, thus making the information in the 
book particularly interesting to anyone considering new products or process 
variations. 

Each formulation in the book is identified by a description of end use. The 
formulations include the following: a listing of each raw material contained; 
the percent by weight of each raw material; suggested formulation procedure; 
and the formula source, which is the company or organization that supplied 
the formula. 

The formulations in the book are divided into the following 14 sections: 

I. Antiperspirants and Deodorants 

II. Baby Products 

III. Bath and Shower Products 

IV. Beauty Aids 

V. Creams 

VI. Fragrances and Perfumes 

VII. Hair Care Products 

VIII. Insect Repellents 

IX. Lotions 

X. Shampoos 

XI. Shaving Products 

XII. Soaps 

XIII. Sun Care Products 

XIV. Miscellaneous 


vii 



viii Preface 


Each formula is indexed in the section which is most applicable. The reader 
seeking a formula for a specific end use should check each section which could 
possibly apply. 

In addition to the above, there are two other sections that will be helpful to the 
reader: 

XV. Trade-Named and Other Raw Materials Descriptions. 

Each raw material is listed with a brief chemical descrip¬ 
tion and the name of the raw material supplier. 

XVI. Suppliers' Addresses. Addresses of suppliers of trade- 
named raw materials and/or formulations, some of which 
are not available in the usual reference books. 

The table of contents of the book is organized in such a way as to serve as a 
subject index. 

My fullest appreciation is expressed to the companies and organizations which 
supplied the information included in this book. 

October, 1989 Ernest W. Flick 


NOTICE 

To the best of our knowledge the information in this publication is 
accurate; however the Publisher does not assume any responsibility 
or liability for the accuracy or completeness of, or consequences 
arising from, such information. This industrial guide does not pur¬ 
port to contain detailed user instructions, and by its range and scope 
could not possibly do so. Mention of trade names or commercial 
products does not constitute endorsement or recommendation for 
use by the Author or Publisher. 

Cosmetic and toiletry raw materials could be toxic in some circum¬ 
stances, and therefore due caution should always be exercised in the 
use of potentially hazardous materials. Final determination of the 
suitability of any information or product for use contemplated by 
any user, and the manner of that use, is the sole responsibility of 
the user. We strongly recommend that users seek and adhere to a 
manufacturer's or supplier's current instructions for handling each 
material they use. 

The Author and Publisher have used their best efforts to include 
only the most recent data available. The reader is cautioned to 
consult the supplier in case of questions regarding current avail¬ 
ability.

Heat all ingredients with agitation to 75 to 80C until 
uniform; cool with agitation (In soma cases phase inversion 
temperature (PIT) is exceeded. When this occurs, a milky emul¬ 
sion occurs which clears as the formulation cools below it's 
PIT. ) 

Viscosities from 500 cps to 5000 cps can be obtained easily 
by slight formula variations. Viscosity stability and clarity 
are excellent at elevated temperatures, room temperature and 
at refrigerated temperatures (4C). Any hazing or clouding effect 
that occurs at lower temperatures disappears as the formulation 
returns to room temperature. 

Since "Shake before using" need not appear on the label, 

Witco believes that this factor, coupled with the more aesthetic 
appearance, offers a more commercially attractive approach to 
roll-on formulating.

Sulfated oils are used in the toilet goods field primarily 
in bath oils and shampoos of the non-lathering type. Their very 
low levels of toxicity or irritation make them ideal for this 
use. For example, the bath oil formulation gives excellent skin 
feeling, and at the same time disperses limesoap curds, thus 
preventing bathtub ring.

This emulsion is similar to the A-28, but is less lipophilic 
(more hydrophyllic). It leaves a smooth, non-sticky feel to the 
skin and is extremely mild. 


Preparation Method: 

Heat Part A to 70C, Part B to 75C. Add Part A to Part B with 
moderate to high agitation, including side-scraping motion. Mix 
for a few minutes, then cool rapidly to 30C. Emulsion will invert 
to give a viscous water-in-oil emulsion. 

The product is a non-pourable viscous cream with a pH about 

6 . 8 .

to 40C and fill. 

There are two principal types of cleansing creams available. 
These are the emulsifiable and the straight oil type. Both of 
these general categories can be adapted to specialty creams as 
for example, detergent type or anti-bacterial type, by the sim¬ 
ple addition of small amounts of active agent such as Borax and 
potassium hydroxide for the detergent cream, and hexachlorophene 
for the anti-bacterial cream.

Among the most popular new developments in hair preparations 
are the clear "ringing” hair gels. 

Combine all ingredients but water and heat to 90C. Heat water 
to 90C in separate container. Add water to oil-surfactant phase 
slowly with good agitation avoiding excessive air entrapment. 
Maintain 90C temperature during entire addition. Maintaining 
agitation, allow to cool. Perfume and color at lowest temperature 
allowing tube fill. 

Notes on Clear Gels: 

1) Only water soluble colors can be added after emulsion is 
formed. If oil soluble colors are used, then it must be 
added to the oil phase at the start prior to water addition. 

2) Certain perfumes will cause a clouding of the gel, but this 
can be cleared by maintaining agitation for several minutes 
after perfume addition. A permanent cloud can be eliminated 
by adding the perfume with approximately 1-2% polyethylene 
glycol 400 mono-oleate and all the propylene glycol. Thus 
the propylene glycol is not added in step 1 with the 
perfume. 

3) Increasing propylene glycol up to 3% improves freeze thaw 
stability. 

4) Increasing phosphate ester to 12% aids the relative ease 
of gel formation and decreases its sensitivity to most 
variations that may occur in the raw materials used.

provides excellent lubricity for ease of wet combing. NIMLESTEROL 
1732 has been shown to penetrate into the hair shaft to provide 
good sheen without an overly greasy feel. It is advisable that 
this conditioner be allowed to stay on the hair at least five to 
ten minutes before rinsing out.

Even with daily use, CELQUAT-based setting lotions consist¬

customer loyalty. The lack of buildup, the elimination of "the

of the hair all combine to preclude brand switching.

temperature. Next heat Part B to approximately 65C and add to 
Part A, which also has been heated to approximately 65C, under 
agitation. When completely blended and the emulsion has formed, 
add Part C and blend in. When cream is completely uniform, pour 
into containers and allow to cool. 

This recipe will make thick creamy lotion that is pleasant

1% of Solulan 98 may be included in the recipe to increase

If the gel is marketed in a clear plastic tube or a clear 
glass jar, it is suggested that 0.1% Escalol 106 or other sun¬ 
screen agent be added to prevent adverse effects on the formula 
from ultra-violet light. 

The viscosity of the gel can be varied by changing the Carb¬ 
opol and Ethomeen content, but the ratio of these two ingred¬ 
ients should be maintained at 1:1.

Repellent-saturated paper towelettes, for applying repellent 
preparations, have become increasingly popular. An all-day 
supply of inexpensive towelettes to treat the whole family can 
be conveniently carried in one's pocket or purse. 

Individual paper towelettes, saturated with Intermediate 5734, 
are sealed in small, non-porous envelopes. Normally, several 
envelopes are sold in a conveniently-priced package. The consumer 
tears open an individual envelope and wipes his face, hands and 
other exposed skin with the towelette to obtain protection 
against mosquitoes, flies, chiggers, etc. 

In production, enough of the above solution is injected into 
the unsealed envelope to saturate the dry towelette - then the 
envelope is sealed. The filling and sealing operation is best 
done on specialized, high-speed equipment.

Experience has shown that Repellent 326 decomposes rapidly 
in sticks made with a soap base. Therefore, the stick was devel¬ 
oped without R-326. It remains firm at elevated temperatures and 
is semi-clear. 

To make a stick, blend Parts A and B separately. Heat and 
stir Part A to uniformity at 55-65C. Add Part B to A and heat 
(65-70C) with agitation or stirring until clear. Immediately 
pour into stick container and cool to room temperature. 

Sticks made in this manner have held up well, both physically 
and chemically after one year’s storage at ambient temperature 
and 1 OOF.

These emulsions have a glossy texture with quick rub-in char¬ 
acteristics. They have an elegant after-feel with some similarity 
to the feel of cationic lotions. 

Viscosity and emulsion stability have been found to be ex¬ 
cellent, and the emulsions exhibited no signs of separation after 
storage at 45C for 30 days and after freeze-thaw recycling.

These lotions have a glossy texture, nongreasy feel with 
nontacky, quick rub-in characteristics. 

Emulsion A is a heavy lotion, whereas Emulsion B is a thin 
lotion suitable as a M milk ,, -type moisturizing formulation. 
Laboratory preparations of these emulsions exhibited no signs 
of separation after storage at 45C for 30 days and after freeze- 
thaw recycling. After 30 months, Emulsion A exhibited a very 
slight increase in viscosity, whereas Emulsion B had the same 
low viscosity. Both emulsions retained their excellent emulsion 
stability.

A smooth, inexpensive cleansing soap with moisturizing lotion. 
This skin cleansing soap contains a lotion that provides 

excellent penetration. This simple, inexpensive liquid soap is 

easy to formulate yet it has the feel of expensive lotions. 

Variations: 

1. Add unique characteristics to the formula by adding collagen, 
elastin, or other popular protein complexes. 

2. Try substituting vegetable oils for mineral oil for an even 
lighter feel. 

3. For health oriented products, add herbal extracts. 

4. Increase the oil phase for dry skin or decrease the oil 
phase and add esters for oily skin.

A smooth, inexpensive lotion with a rich, luxuriant feel. 

This lotion applies smoothly and provides excellent penetra¬ 
tion. While simple and inexpensive to create, this formula gives 
the feel of more expensive lotions. The METHOCEL cellulose ether 
helps leave skin with a silky feel. It gives the sensation of 
moisturizing and protection but with no greasy afterfeel. 

Variations: 

1. Add unique characteristics to the formula by adding collagen, 
elastin, or other popular protein complexes. 

2. Try substituting vegetable oils for mineral oil for an even 
lighter feel. 

3. For health oriented products, add herbal extracts. 

4. Increase the oil phase for dry skin or decrease the oil 
phase and add esters for oily skin.

A light natural lotion that protects dry skin. 

This very light lotion provides excellent penetration and 
leaves no greasy afterfeel. The skin is left feeling dry but 
with a light barrier due to the dimethicone. Because there are 
no animal oils or petroleum distillates such as mineral oil 
in this formulation, it's perfect for the health-oriented market. 

Variations: 

1 . Make unique formulations for specific market segments by 
adding proteins or herbal extracts. 

2. Increase the wax phase to create an oil free cream.

Basic Characteristics: 

1. Contain low to medium concentration of anionic surfactants. 

2. Conditioning can be several "types". 

a) Super-fatting effects 

b) Enhanced wet and/or dry combing 

c) Enhanced gloss/luster 

d) Reduced fly-away (i.e. anti-static effect) 

3. In order to "condition" something must be adhered to the 
hair. Therefore, a "conditioning shampoo" must represent 
a compromise situation.

Procedure: 

Charge water into mixing vessel and with rapid but smooth 
agitation, disperse MAPHOS L-13. Adjust pH to 7.0-7,2 with 
diethanolamine as needed. Warm solution to 45-50C with smooth 
agitation and blend in the first five ingredients. Once the 
system is uniform, cool to 30-35C with moderate agitation and 
adjust pH to 6.5-6.8 with citric acid as needed. Blend in 
perfume, dye and preservative and then adjust formulation 
viscosity to 5,000-7,000 cps with sodium chloride as needed. 

Product Characteristics: 

Transparent viscous liquid that lathers readily on the skin 
or hair. The emollient ingredients, in this formulation, form 
a protective barrier on the skin which facilitates shaving and 
eliminates razor drag. This formulation is ideal as an emollient 
body shampoo, for the bath or shower, and as a liquid shaving 
foam for face and body.

In this formulation, the detergency of EMERSAL 6400 Sodium 
Lauryl Sulfate is enhanced by the sulfosuccinate which also 
helps to decrease the irritation potential generally associated 
with sulfates. The ETHOXYOL 1707 reduces any excess drying effect 
generated by heavy detergent washing and helps keep skin soft 
and supple. 

Procedure: 

Combine all ingredients and heat with agitation to 75C until 
a homogeneous blend is obtained. Cool to 40C and adjust viscosity

pH 6.0 to 6.5 with dilute phosphoric, citric, lactic or hydro¬ 
chloric acid. Add ammonium chloride solution for desired vis¬ 
cosity. 

Currently available "liquid soap" formulations are based on 
mild detergents and additives to yield high-lathering, mild 
cleansers that leave the skin soft and smooth with a pronounced 
after-feel. Alpha-olefin sulfonates have been demonstrated to 
leave the skin smoother than alkyl sulfates and coconut-based 
soaps. The above formulation, which is prepared without use of 
heat, is an economical, effective skin cleanser meeting current 
market requirements. 

Opacification or pearlescence can be added by the use of 
appropriate latex or liquid pearling agent.

Carboxymethyl cellulose is dispersed in water with the aid 
of heat. Use warm water for the preparation. The resulting gel 
should be free from lumps. After the gel has cooled add potash 
(as a 45% solution) with agitation. 

The oleic acid, deodorized kerosene and CARNATION White 
Mineral Oil are mixed together in a separate container and the 
blend is then added slowly to the potash-carboxymethyl cellulose- 
water mixture with slow agitation. High speed agitation should 
be avoided. 

The consistency of the above emulsion can be varied, if 
desired, by either increasing or decreasing the amount of 
carboxymethyl cellulose.

Notes: 

1. Alcohol ethoxysulfate can be either NEODOL 25-3A or NEODOL 
25-3S if the pH of the formulation is 7 or lower. If pH is 
not adjusted to 7 or below, NEODOL 25-3S must be used. 

2. The pH can be adjusted to a value lower than 7 (e.g., 5.5- 
6.5), if desired, with little effect on physical properties. 

3. Opacifier is glycol distearate. 

4. The EDTA salt may be either disodium or tetrasodium ethylene- 
diamine tetraacetate. 

5. Glycerin (1-2%w) is added to improve "feel" on hands. 

6. The amount of sodium chloride needed to achieve a given 
viscosity may vary with the exact nature and source of the 
surfactant raw materials.

WATERLESS HAND CLEANER 


INGREDIENTS 


% As Supplied 


Water 28.45 
ACRYSOL ASE-108 Stabilizer 7,05 
TRITON X-100 Surfactant 10.00 
Deodorized Kerosene 40.00 
Mineral Oil 10.00 
Sodium Hydroxide (10%) 4.50 


Mixing Instructions: 

Add components in listed order. Dispersion of kerosene re¬ 
quires high-shear mixing. Moderate subsurface agitation is 
sufficient for the other ingredients. 


This formulation produces a flowable paste that removes 
grease, ink, and other solvent-removable soils. The viscosity 
can be adjusted by reducing the level of ACRYSOL ASE-108 polymer 
while correspondingly lowering the amount of sodium hydroxide. 

A concentration of 2.5% ACRYSOL ASE-108 polymer produces a 
lotion. If emollient characteristics are desired, 0.5 to 2.5 
percent water-soluble lanolin can be added. The addition of 
lanolin raises the original viscosity two to three fold.

Preparation: 

1. Mix the kerosene or oil and oleic acid. 

2. Dissolve the amines in the water and stir in SURFONIC 
surface-active agent and propylene glycol, U.S.P. In 
Formula A, add "Versene" and stir until it is dissolved. 

3. Add (1) to (2) or (2) to (1), depending on convenience and 
stir until a smooth cream is obtained. No heating is required 

Lanolin may be added to the kerosene to reduce the defatting 
action of the kerosene on the skin and the surfactant content 
can be increased to make the cleaner easier to remove with water

Procedure: 

Heat mildly part a) to dissolve all ingredients. Once homo¬ 
geneous, the emulsification process is carried out at ambient 
temperature. Slowly add 1/3 of part b) to part a) while mixing 
at moderate turbine speed in order to preform the emulsion, then 
add the last increment of part b) while rising the speed of 
agitation, taking care to avoid air entrapment. Finally add part 
c), mix until homogeneous. Pack in suitable plastic containers 
Note: the viscosity of the emulsion increases with an increase 
of the energy used to emulsify. A cream is obtained when 
passing the emulsion through the homogenizer.
