So, what is the role of triethanolamine in cosmetics? The role of triethanolamine in cosmetics. It can be neutralized with cp-940 to achieve thickening and moisturizing effect. It is used as emulsifier, humectant, humidifier, thickener, pH balancer in cosmetics (including skin washing, eye gel, moisturizer, shampoo, etc.). The cream made of triethanolamine has the characteristics of fine paste and bright white paste. The function of triethanolamine in cosmetics, it is used to neutralize fatty acids into soaps and sulfated fatty acids into amines. Triethanolamine is a common emulsifier in cream preparation. The cream product emulsified with triethanolamine has the characteristics of fine paste and bright white paste. In addition, the colloidal phase formed by triethanolamine and higher fatty acids or higher fatty alcohols is stable, the product quality is stable, and the proportion of external components is high.  Triethanolamine is the most commonly used neutralizer containing carbomer and other acid Polymer gels. Triethanolamine neutralizes carboxy groups such as carbomer to form a stable polymer structure, so as to achieve the application effect of thickening and moisturizing. The content of triethanolamine in cosmetics and the requirements for raw materials are quite strict. Once the content is too heavy, it will bring great harm to people's skin. Therefore, the application of high-quality triethanolamine in middle and high-end cosmetics is more mature. With the continuous pursuit of green health, high-quality triethanolamine skin care products are more and more popular in the market. With the increasing incidence of skin diseases in recent years, people pay more and more attention to the quality of cosmetics while paying attention to the beauty. Therefore, cosmetics appearing on the market in recent years tend to add high-quality harmless additives, which contains huge business opportunities. Application of triethanolamine different content of triethanolamine has different functions in the chemical industry, so it can be classified into more suitable and safer use. Triethanolamine can be used for industrial gas purification, pH control stabilizer, rubber vulcanization accelerator, developer stabilizer, engine carbon deposition inhibitor, vulcanization activator of Natural Rubber and synthetic rubber, polymerization activator of NBR, lubricating oil and anti-corrosion additive, etc. Triethanolamine needs to be more refined, higher purity and diversified in the future.
