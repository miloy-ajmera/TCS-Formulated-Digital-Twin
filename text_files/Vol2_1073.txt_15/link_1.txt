                            BioSignal™ Lipid 10 MB is a patented, proprietary, skin-mimetic technology comprising of phosphotidylglycerol, a unique naturally-occurring phospholipid. BioSignal™ Lipid 10 MB stimulates the expression of several epidermal proteins known to strengthen the skin barrier, hydrate the skin and reduce the inflammatory signaling pathways. In clinical studies, this ingredient not only demonstrates benefits for skin moisturization, tightening and radiance but was also found to work synergistically with irritating actives to decrease their irritation potential in sensitive skin. view less
