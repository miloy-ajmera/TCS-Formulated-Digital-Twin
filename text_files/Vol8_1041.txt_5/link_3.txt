Description



Description

Protein purification reagent Triethanolamine acts as an organic additive in the grinding of cement clinker and as a complexing agent for aluminum ions in aqueous solutions. It is used as an emulsifier and a surfactant. It finds application in common products like dishwashing liquids, general cleaners, hand cleaners, shaving cream, metalworking fluids, liquid laundry detergents, paints and printing inks. It is used for the neutralization of fatty acids and adjusting buffer pH as well as utilized to dissolve oils. It acts as an effective complexing agent in electroless plating. Further, it is used in hair care products like hair dyes and wave sets. This Thermo Scientific Chemicals brand product was originally part of the Alfa Aesar product portfolio. Some documentation and label information may refer to the legacy brand. The original Alfa Aesar product / item code or SKU reference has not changed as a part of the brand transition to Thermo Scientific Chemicals.
