Star0IdentificationBrand NamesTru-micinGeneric NameTrolamineDrugBank Accession NumberDB13747BackgroundTrolamine, which is also referred to as triethanolamine (TEA), is a tertiary amine and a triol. It is a bifunctional compound that exhibits both properties of alcohols and amines. Trolamine contains small amounts of diethanolamine and ethanolamine and may also act as an antioxidant against the auto-oxidation of animal and vegetable fats 1. It is commonly used as a pH adjuster and surfactant in industrial and cosmetic products such as skin and hair conditioning products.

It is not considered to be an active pharmacological ingredient and so has no official indication.

Mechanism of actionAs an amine, trolamine is capable of accepting a hydrogen to form hydroxide and a conjugate acid. This raises the pH of the solution. As a surfactant, it can lower the interfacial tension in a mixture or solution to prevent separation of emulsions or precipitation of a compound out of solution.
AbsorptionDermal absorption of trolamine increases with the dose 1. This has been found to range from 19-28% in rats with doses of 68-276 mg/kg in 190 μL of acetone without occlusion and from 60-80% in mice with doses of 79-1120 mg/kg in the same volume of acetone.
Volume of distributionNot AvailableProtein bindingNot AvailableMetabolismTrolamine is excreted mostly as the unchanged compound 1. No diethanolamine or ethanolamine has been found. Very small amounts of trolamine glucuronide have been detected but not quantified.

Glucuronide Conjugate (Trolamine)Route of eliminationWhen orally administered to rats, the 53% of the trolamine dose was found to be excreted in the urine and 20% in the feces 1. 98% was excreted in the urine with intravenous administration.
Half-lifeNot AvailableClearanceNot AvailableAdverse EffectsImprove decision support & research outcomesWith structured adverse effects data, including: blackbox warnings, adverse reactions, warning & precautions, & incidence rates.Learn more  Improve decision support & research outcomes with our structured adverse effects data.Learn moreToxicityTrolamine produced mild erythema and edema in rabbits with dermally administered doses of 2 g/kg under occlusion 1. The oral LD50 was found to be 8 g/kg in guinea pigs and 4.19-11.26 g/kg in rats. Repeated oral administration in rats and guinea pigs produced hepatic and renal damage with deaths occurring in rats at doses >0.3 g/kg/day. When inhaled trolamine produced edema and inflammation in rats at doses over 100 mg/m³ after 5 days and at doses over 4.7 mg/m³ after 90 days. There is some evidence of carcinogenicity at high dermal doses (1000 mg/kg/day) in mice. Trolamine is not classified as a carcinogen in humans.
