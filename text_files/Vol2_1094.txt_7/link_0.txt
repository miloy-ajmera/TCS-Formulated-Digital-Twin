Most importantly, cetearyl alcohol is very different from “regular” alcohols, like ethanol.As a health-conscious consumer, you’re likely always on the lookout for skin and haircare products that don’t contain harmful ingredients.Fortunately, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires manufacturers to list ingredients on a product’s label so that you can make an informed decision about what products you choose to put in or on your body.What is cetearyl alcohol?Cetearyl alcohol is a chemical found in cosmetic products. It’s a white, waxy mixture of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, both fatty alcohols. They’re found in animals and plants, like coconut and palm oil. They can also be made in a laboratory.They’re used in personal care products, mainly skin lotions, hair products, and creams. They help create smoother creams, thicker lotions, and more stable foam products.Fatty alcohols are sometimes called long-chain alcohols because of their chemical formula. They usually have an even number of carbon atoms, with a single alcohol group (–OH) attached to the last carbon.What is <meta charset=”utf-8″>cetearyl alcohol used for?Cetyl alcohol helps prevent creams from separating into oil and liquid. A chemical that helps to keep liquid and oil together is known as an emulsifier. It may also make a product thicker or increase the product’s ability to foam.Products with cetearyl alcoholskin lotionsmoisturizersskin creamssunscreenshampooconditionershair removal creamshair mousseanti-frizz hair creamhair dyemascaraWas this helpful?It most often appears on the ingredient list as cetearyl alcohol but may have many other names.Other names(C16-C18) alkyl alcoholalcohols, C1618C16-18 alcoholscetostearyl alcoholcetyl/stearyl alcohol1-octadecanol, mixed with 1-hexadecanolWas this helpful?Cetearyl alcohol isn’t the only fatty alcohol used in cosmetic products. Other examples include cetyl alcohol, lanolin, oleyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol.Is <meta charset=”utf-8″>cetearyl alcohol safe?You may have heard that you should avoid hair and skin products that contain alcohol. This is because many alcohols, like ethanol or rubbing alcohol, can be very drying. Using alcohol on your skin and hair could lead to itchiness, flaking, and skin peeling.In fact, alcohols are commonly found in products like astringents, hand sanitizers, and aftershave due to their fast-drying and skin-tightening abilities.But fatty alcohols, like cetearyl alcohol, don’t have the same effect on the skin as other alcohols due to their chemical structure.The chemical makeup of cetearyl alcohol is different from more commonly known alcohols. In cetearyl alcohol, the alcohol group (-OH) is attached to a very long chain of hydrocarbons (fats). This feature allows fatty alcohols to trap water and provides a soothing feel to the skin.Chemicals that make the skin feel smooth are referred to as emollients. They work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin to keep the moisture inside.The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel concluded in 1988 that fatty alcohols, including cetearyl alcohol, are safe for use in cosmetic products. A subsequent 2005 review confirmed these results.In clinical studies, cetearyl alcohol was found to have no significant toxicity and was non-mutagenic.A mutagen is a chemical agent that changes your DNA. DNA changes can cause certain diseases, like cancer.It was also found not to irritate the skin. According to the FDA, even cosmetic products labeled “alcohol-free” are allowed to contain cetearyl alcohol and other fatty alcohols. Cetearyl alcohol is also included on the FDA list of safe and permitted food additives.As with many skin care products, there’s a small risk of allergic reaction to cetearyl alcohol.If you have sensitive skin or other allergies, it may be a good idea to perform a patch test with any product containing this ingredient. Tell your doctor if you experience burning, blistering, swelling, stinging, redness, or irritation that persists or gets worse.The bottom lineCetearyl alcohol is used to help soften the skin and hair and to thicken and stabilize cosmetic products, like lotions and hair products. As an emollient, cetearyl alcohol is considered an effective ingredient for soothing and healing dry skin.Unless you have very sensitive skin, you probably don’t need to avoid products containing cetearyl alcohol. Not only is it considered safe and nontoxic for use on the skin and hair, but it’s also not drying or irritating like other types of alcohol.Due to its chemical structure, cetearyl alcohol is even permitted by the FDA as an ingredient in products labeled “alcohol-free.” Last medically reviewed on  February 14, 2022How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical associations.
