What is BUTYLENE GLYCOL used for?

Butylene glycol hydrates, conditions, and acts as a barrier to protect the skin and hair. This magical ingredient has a lot of benefits, making it quite popular in the cosmetic industry.

Skin care: It acts as a humectant which means that it attracts water to the upper layers of the skin and binds it there to keep the skin hydrated. It also creates a barrier on the skin to protect it from harmful surroundings
Hair care: It acts as a great conditioner for the hair, making it soft and flowy. This ingredient prevents water loss from the hair, thus keeping them from drying out. Further, it is also a viscosity-decreasing agent, which means that it prevents the products from sticking together and clamming up




Origin

Butylene glycol is derived from petroleum, sugarcane, or distilled corn. It is made by the catalytic hydrogenation of acetaldehyde. For use in cosmetic and skin care products, it generally comes in liquid form and works well with almost all the ingredients.
