Description


BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to an antiinflammatory medicament formulation which has an analgesic action and is to be applied topically, and which contains 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-ethyl N-(.alpha.,.alpha.,.alpha.-trifluoro-m-tolyl)anthranilate, called Etofenamate below, as the essential active compound. Etofenamate has the following structure: ##STR1##
Etofenamate is already known as a non-steroid medicament with a good antiinflammatory action and outstanding tolerance, compare Arzneimittelforschung 27 (I) Special Edition 6 b, 1299-1364, 1977. Etofenamate has hitherto been used in the form of alcohol-containing gels. Because of the alcohol, the gel has a cooling action when applied, and this has not been found pleasant by all patients. Furthermore, such a gel can be applied only to intact skin, and a desirable application in cases of trauma with open wounds is thus not possible. In addition, such a formulation is of only limited suitability for patients with an exceptionally dry skin.
An object of the present invention is thus to overcome the disadvantages described by providing a new formulation which, however, has the antiinflammatory and analgesic action to the same degree as the gel form.
Surprisingly, it has been possible to discover cream and ointment formulations which have the required properties.
The present invention thus relates to cream and ointment formulations containing Etofenamate and an adjuvant.
Etofenamate is a highly viscous oil, only traces of which dissolve in water. In a large number of galenical auxiliaries, it has only inadequate solubility, interactions, such as, for example, hydrolysis, transesterification, esterification and the like, take place, or demixing, phase separation and the like occurs. Although some formulations containing Etofenamate have proved homogeneous and stable, their absorption is inadequate in comparison with the known Etofenamate-containing gel. These disadvantages do not arise in the formulation according to the invention. In the formulation according to the invention, the absorption of Etofenamate by the skin is outstanding.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The cream and ointment formulations according to the present invention thus also contain, in addition to Etofenamate, an adjuvant and, if appropriate, agents which give the formulation consistency and/or emulsifiers and other auxiliaries, such as additives which promote circulation or have a warming effect or which have a pleasant odor.
According to the invention, one or more compounds from the groups: triglycerides, and/or esters of monohydric and/or polyhydric alcohols, and/or higher alcohols, are used as the adjuvant.
Adjuvants which are preferably used from the triglyceride group are one or more triglycerides of medium-chain carboxylic acids of C.sub.6 to C.sub.14 chain length in saturated or unsaturated, preferably mono-unsaturated and branched or straight-chain form, particularly preferably, neutral oils, such as, for example, Miglyol 810.RTM. or Miglyol 812.RTM. or Viscoleo.RTM..
Viscoleo.RTM. is understood as meaning a mixture of saturated triglycerides of medium chain length and a fatty acid distribution of 45-60% of caprylic acid, 35-50% of capric acid and 2-10% of lauric acid, and Miglyol.RTM. is understood as meaning a caprylic/capric acid triglyceride.
An adjuvant from the group of esters of monohydric and/or polyhydric alcohols is preferably understood as meaning one or more esters of monohydric and/or polyhydric alcohols of C.sub.1 -C.sub.18 (preferably C.sub.2 to C.sub.18) chain length with carboxylic acid components of C.sub.6 -C.sub.18 chain length, especially where the alcohols are alkanols or alkenols and the carboxylic acids are alkane or alkene - carboxylic acids, particularly preferably are propylene glycol diesters, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, stearate or palmitate, diisopropyl adipate, diethyl sebacate, oleyl oleate, hexyl laurate and isooctyl stearate, and very particularly preferably diisopropyl adipate and/or isopropyl myristate.
Adjuvants from the group of C.sub.8 -C.sub.20 alcohols are used to accomplish the objections of the invention.
An adjuvant from the group of higher alcohols is preferably understood as meaning oleyl alcohol and/or 2-octyl-dodecanol, particularly preferably 2-octyl-dodecanol, by itself.
According to the invention, Etofenamate can be present in the formulations as a mixture with one or more adjuvants of all three groups or of only two groups or only one group.
Starting from these Etofenamate/adjuvant mixtures or solutions, various creams of a liquid to semi-solid consistency can be prepared: 1. Oil-in-water emulsions, 2. Water-in-oil emulsions and 3. Microemulsions.
According to the invention, it is necessary for the cream consisting of the active compound and adjuvant to contain about 2 to about 30% by weight of Etofenamate as the active compound and about 5 to about 80% by weight of adjuvant or adjuvant mixtures as described above.
According to the invention, it is necessary for the ointment consisting of the active compound and adjuvant to contain about 5 to about 40% by weight of Etofenamate as the active compound and about 3 to about 95% by weight of adjuvant or adjuvant mixtures as described above. The mixture particularly preferably contains 5-15% by weight of Etofenamate, and particularly preferably 6-12% by weight.
The formulation can furthermore also contain one or more agents to give it consistency and/or one or more emulsifiers and/or additives which promote circulation or have a warming effect and/or other auxiliaries, such as, for example, substances which have a pleasant odor, and/or also other active compounds.
In many cases, agents which give the formulation consistency and emulsifiers are also identical, and strict separation is thus not possible.
As agents which give the formulation consistency, there may be used one or more of the group of fatty alcohols (especially alkanols or alkenols), of C.sub.10 to C.sub.30 chain length, such as for example, stearyl alcohol, hydrocarbons, such as petroleum jelly,paraffins, hard paraffins and waxes, such as beeswax or carnauba wax. It is furthermore also possible to use monoglycerides, diglycerides and triglycerides, such as glycerol monostearate and glycerol distearate, and metal soaps, such as Al stearate, Aerosol.RTM. (silicon dioxide colloid) and polyglycols, such as polyalkylene glycols, such as polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols.
The consistency of the aqueous phase of water-containing formulations can be adjusted by means of hydrogel-forming agents, such as Veegum.RTM., cellulose derivatives (for example methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose), carboxyvinyl polymers such as polyacrylates and especially Carbopol 940.RTM., 938.RTM. and 941.RTM., alginic acid derivatives, gum arabicum and the like.
As the emulsifier there may be used one or more from the group of ionic or non-ionic water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsifiers.
Compounds which are preferably used are slats of higher fatty acids and bile acids, such as triethanolamine stearate, alkyl sulphates, such as Na lauryl sulphate, alkylsulphonates, such as Na cetylsulphonate, higher fatty alcohols, such as cetyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, sterol alcohols, such as cholesterol, fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and polyols, such as ethylene monostearate, glycerol monooleate, sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan trioleate, polyoxyethylene-(20) sorbitan monolaurate and polyoxyethylene sorbitol hexaoleate, fatty alcohol ethers, such as polyoxyethylene lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene oleyl ether, fatty acid esters of sucrose, such as sucrose distearate, lecithin and derivatives, betaines and sulphobetaines, such as fatty acid amidoalkylbetaine and/or polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene polymers, such as pluronics.
Examples of additives which may be used which promote circulation or have a warming effect are benzyl nicotinate, salicylic acid esters, for example methylsalicylate, ethereal oils, capsaicin, capsicum extract or nonylic acid vanillyamide.
The customary pharmacologically acceptable substances can be used as the odor substances, as long as they are compatible with the active compound and adjuvant.
The amount of agents which give the formulation consistency and/or emulsifiers in the formulation, besides the Etofenamate and adjuvant, is up to about 70% by weight, and is preferably 5 to 25% by weight.
Furthermore, the cream formulation also contains up to 85% by weight, preferably 40 to 60% by weight, of water.
Cream formulations containing 2 to 30% by weight of Etofenamate, 5-80% by weight of adjuvant and 40 to 60% by weight of water are particularly preferred.
A preferred cream formulation contains 50 to 100 mg of Etofenamate, 400 to 650 mg of water, 100 to 150 mg of an adjuvant of an emulsifier selected from the group consisting of isopropylmyristate, diisopropyl adipate, Miglyol 810.RTM. and Miglyol 840.RTM., 40 to 60 of Myrj. 59.RTM., 0 to 10 mg of Tylose MH 400 (methylcellulose), 30 to 180 mg of Cutina MD.RTM. or Cutina GMS.RTM., 10 to 50 mg of a citrate buffer, 0 to 15 mg benzyl nicotinate, 0 to 20 mg of cetyl alcohol and 0 to 20 mg of Veegum.RTM..
Preferred ointment formulations contain up to 250 mg of Etofenamate, 50 to 100 mg of an adjuvant selected from the group consisting of diisopropyl adipate, isopropyl myristate, Miglyol 840.RTM., Miglyol 812.RTM., oleyl alcohol and diisopropyl stearate, 20 to 60 mg of an emulsifier selected from the group consisting of Cremophor EL.RTM., Tween 40.RTM., Tween 60.RTM. and Myrj. 59.RTM., 0 to 1000 mg of an agent which gives consistency selected from the group consisting of wool wax alcohol ointment DAB 8, Softisan.RTM., PEG 4000 and Cutina MD.RTM., 0 to 100 mg of Aerosil.RTM., 0 to 50 mg of cetyl alcohol, 0 to 500 mg of PEG 400 and 0 to 20 mg of benzyl nicotate.
The formulations, the composition of which can be seen from the examples, are furthermore particularly preferred.
According to the invention, the antiinflammatory, analgesic cream formulations according to the invention are prepared by mixing the Etofenamate, dissolved in a suitable solvent, with any other molten fat/wax emulsifier constituents and then adding, with intensive mixing of the constituents, the aqueous phase, which has been brought to about the same temperature and contains preservatives, buffer and the like. Homogenization is then carried out, for example, by means of a rotor-stator device.
According to the invention, the antinflammatory, analgesic ointment formulations according to the invention are prepared by mixing the Etofenamate, dissolved in a suitable solvent, with any other molten fat/wax emulsifier constituents and then subjecting the mixture to homogenization.
The homogenization temperature depends on the particular formulation and is generally between about 40.degree. and about 60.degree. C.
The Etofenamate formulation according to the invention contains the active compound in stable form and is capable of penetrating the skin without having the entraining function of isopropanol, which is contained in the gel. Comparison studies with Etofenamate gel showed a bioequivalent absorption, which it was possible to demonstrate by an approximately equal absorption rate, timed to the maximum plasma level, maximum plasma level concentration, elimination from the plasma, area under the plasma level curves (AUC) and renal elimination in humans. The present invention may be illustrated in more detail by the following examples.
The Etofenamate formulation according to the invention contains the active compound in stable form and is capable of penetrating the skin without having the entraining function, for example, of isopropanol. Comparison studies with Etofenamate gel showed a bioequivalent absorption, which it was possible to demonstrate by an approximately equal absorption rate, timed to the maximum plasma level, maximum plasma level concentration, elimination from the plasma, area under the plasma level curfves (AUC) and renal elimination in warm-blooded animals.
The equivalence of the absorption is also shown by clinical trials, in which the activity was compared in a double-blind cross-over study against ointment containing 1-(p-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid and against salicylic-containing ointments, and in which the formulation according to the invention had a significantly (p<0.05) better action, for example in Lumbago cases in respect of the Schober distance and the spontaneous, movement and pressure pain, compared with the first comparison product, and proved significantly more effective, for example in cases of acute gonathrosis in respect of the target parameters of joint mobility, joint range and spontaneous and movement pain, compared with the second comparison product.
