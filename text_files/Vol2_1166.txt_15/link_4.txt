        Abstract
        
      



          Objective:
        
      
      The purpose of the present study was to assess the anti-erosive potential of the acquired enamel pellicle formed in situ under the influence of periodic milk or cream treatment.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The pellicle was formed on bovine enamel specimens in the oral cavity at buccal and palatal sites of upper molars in 6 subjects, using removable acrylic splints. During 6-h of intraoral exposure, splints were removed from the oral cavity every 25 min, treated with milk or cream for 5 min, and subsequently re-inserted into the oral cavity. After 6 h, pellicle covered specimens were immersed in citric acid (0.1 or 1.0 %) for 1 min, and processed for measurement of surface microhardness, determination of calcium release by atomic absorption spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Statistical analysis did not indicate major differences between erosive surface alterations on enamel specimens covered by pellicles treated with cream or milk, and those covered by control pellicles. In addition, TEM analysis did not reveal any differences concerning the ultrastructure of the different pellicle treatments during acid exposure. All pellicles were dissolved in part after exposure to 0.1 % citric acid and were nearly completely removed after treatment with 1.0% citric acid.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      It is concluded that periodic treatment with milk or cream during pellicle formation in situ does not improve the protective potential of the acquired enamel pellicle against erosion.
    


          Clinical significance:
        
      
      Modification of the pellicle by consumption of milk or cream prior to an acidic challenge cannot sufficiently protect enamel from erosion.
