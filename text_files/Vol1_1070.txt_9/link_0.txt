Description


Dual Purpose Massage Creme, Therapists' trusted choice for over 30 years, provides a superior combination of an oil's workability and a lotion's absorbency. Arnica and Ivy Extract's botanical qualities are the first choice for relief and provide added skin health and wellness benefits.
This ideal lubricant meets the texture requirements for various massage modalities ranging from high glide circulatory to slow deep tissue techniques leaving skin feeling soft and smooth without any residue. Extra rich consistency will not spill and washes out easily from linens and clothing.

Arnica & Ivy Extracts Aid Circulation

32 Years of massage and I have been using this cream!!
I have tried other products over the years but nothing compares if you are doing a lot of deep tissue massage. No smell and no staining with absolute staying power!! I love it!!

The ONLY Massage Creme
If only every MT would use this. Why people are still stuck with oil beats me. Who wants to be a grease bomb getting off the table. Dual Purpose - as its name implies, perfect for deep tissue, Swedish, the face, and the only massage creme I’ve used for 25 years. Leaves the client feeling good with no need to shower, helps hydrate and heal tissue. I keep this warm for the client and wonderful being applied. Order some, check it out. Yogiferris@proton.me

This stuff is the bomb!
I’ve been using this stuff for the past 2+ years when I couldn’t get any Bob Vitale lotion when they shut their plants down over Covid. Their loss! I’ve never been happier than when using this stuff. Perfect glide, texture, smell whether I’m doing deep tissue and need just a little or some fluff n buff stuff with a lot more. It adapts to my needs like magic! Not one complaint from me about this stuff! It’s even better than the pure jojoba I used to use years ago. It’s the best!
