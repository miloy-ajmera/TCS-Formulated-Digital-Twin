Bisabolol
Arctander describes it as "Sweet and very mild, delicately floral odor.” and goes on to point out that at that time “Although not regularly available or generally offered as a synthetic material yet, this sesquiterpene alcohol should soon become known and possibly find use as a blender / fixative of very versatile use. Its acceptability and popularity will, of course, largely depend upon the cost level. But with the enormous drop in the cost of synthetic Nerolidol over a period of less than 10 years to a level where this alcohol can be used in almost any type of fragrance, there may be good hope that Bisabolol can achieve a similar level of popuIarity."

RTD ALPHA-BISABOLOL NATURAL
Odor: characteristicUse: Natural alpha-Bisabolol, also known as Levomenol, may be obtained from the direct distillation of the oil from the tropical shrub candeia. This shrub, Linnean name Vanillosmopsis erythropappa, which is of the Asteraceae family, grows in the southeast and midwest regions of Brazil. This tree yields a white, hard, resinous wood and its leaves, flowers and oil have medicinal properties.
Natural alpha-Bisabolol is also a major constituent of German Chamomile [Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Oil], which has been used in the traditional medicines of Europe for hundreds of years. The essential oil of chamomile contains up to 50% 1-alpha-bisabolol.
RTD Alpha-Bisabolol Natural is an optically active viscous colorless to somewhat yellow liquid with slight characteristic floral wood odor. It contains at least 95% (-)-1-alpha-bisabolol, a monocyclic unsaturated sesquiterpene alcohol. Alpha-Bisabolol, which is nontoxic and nonirritating to the skin, has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties, as well as antimycotic and antibacterial effects. Specifically, it is a potent inhibitor of fungi, Candida albicans and gram-positive bacteria.
RTD Alpha-Bisabolol Natural is suitable for use in skin care products where the formulator wishes to take advantage of its anti-inflammatory, bactericidal and antimycotic properties, which make it a preferred active ingredient for protection of skin against stresses including cleansing, shaving, depilation, and sun exposure. When RTD Alpha-Bisabolol Natural is used at low levels (0.1 - 1.0% is recommended), it is active, safe, and skin compatible.
NATURAL VS. SYNTHETIC BISABOLOL
As previously noted, the essential oils of both chamomile and candeia are good botanical sources for preparing 95+% pure (-) alpha-Bisabolol. Bisabolol can also be made by chemical synthesis. The substance thus obtained, however, is only about 85% pure Bisabolol and, further, is a racemic mixture of both levorotary and dextrorotary isomers. So the synthetic product contains only about 42% of active (-) isomer. When considering the cost effectiveness of natural vs. synthetic material, remember that 1 kg natural Alpha-Bisabolol contains a minimum of 950 g active (-) Alpha-Bisabolol, while 1 kg synthetic Alpha-Bisabolol contains only about 425 g active (-) Alpha-Bisabolol. So on an “actives" basis, RTD Alpha-Bisabolol Natural is about 2.24 times more potent than synthetic material.

 Notes: 
IFRA FLAVOR REQUIREMENTS:
Due to the possible ingestion of small amounts of fragrance ingredients from their use in products in Categories 1 and 6, materials must not only comply with IFRA Standards but must also be recognized as safe as a flavoring ingredient as defined by the IOFI Code of Practice (www.iofi.org). For more details see chapter 1 of the Guidance for the use of IFRA Standards.
