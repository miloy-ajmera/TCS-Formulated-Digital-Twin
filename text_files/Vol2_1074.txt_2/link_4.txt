What is CARBOMER used for?

Carbomer is primarily a thickening agent that makes the products more viscous and maintains their texture, flow, and consistency. It is used in numerous products such as lotions, shampoos, lipsticks, nail polishes, etc.

Skin care: It is an excellent emulsifier that prevents water and oil from separating in skincare products. This ingredient also absorbs and retains water to make products like lotions and creams more rich and creamy. It does not make the skin tight or dry
Hair care: It controls the stickiness and consistency of the formulation in hair care products and makes them more spreadable. It also works well with almost all the other ingredients




Origin

Carbomer is a collective name used for a series of polymers that are made of acrylic acid. These are lightweight powders that turn into a clear gel or liquid when neutralized. Further, Carbomer is not a natural ingredient as it is made synthetically.
