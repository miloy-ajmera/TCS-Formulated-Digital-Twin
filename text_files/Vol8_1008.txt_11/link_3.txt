Here I’m addressing specific skin care ingredients and why you might need to avoid them while you are pregnant.There are definitely some ingredients that you should avoid while pregnant due to possible birth defects. The placenta is basically a big sieve, it lets things through in a very non-specific (and size based) fashion. Your baby is busy doing things like making organs, which means that small mistakes early on can have big effects later on.While your skin is a barrier, we do know that some of the products you put on it will be well absorbed and those ingredients can reach the blood stream. Which means they can reach the placenta and therefore your baby.We will never have data regarding safety for many of these ingredients. The studies just wouldn’t be ethical to complete (would you want to be volunteering to try something out and see if it affects your baby? Not me!) so we just make do with the information we do have and try to make some educated guesses.Pregnancy Skin Care Ingredients to AvoidChemical SunscreensThey’ve been found in your bloodstream, no one really knows what they do… it’s better to stick with the physical sunscreens which sit on the surface of your skin. There have been some published papers linking chemical sunscreens to Hirschsprung’s (1) and hypospadias (2), and are known endocrine disruptors. As well, some chemical sunscreens are also salicylates. For this reason, I recommend avoiding all chemical sunscreens while pregnant.Note that chemical sunscreens are often found in products that don’t have a listed SPF value. Discussion on that is here: Why did you say this product has sunscreen when there isn’t an SPF?RetinoidsRetin A/Accutane, Retinoids, Vitamin A: Yes, the big baddies here are definitely the 2 prescription drugs listed first. Accutane is a huge issue with pregnancy as it is linked to many different birth defects. In fact, most physicians won’t even prescribe it to women of child bearing age unless they are also on birth control or sign a waiver.While Retin A and over the counter retinoids are not as strongly linked to birth defects as Accutane, they are all the same class of drug and as such are on pretty much every MD’s list of no-no ingredients. The retinoids are Vitamin A derivatives, and I’ve seen quite a few lists advising to avoid topical Vitamin A as well, so it’s made my list. Yes, there is still Vitamin A in your diet and your prenatal vitamin. It should be there and can take care of your needs. But, no need to add even more in skin care. Here’s a good peer reviewed article regarding retinoids in pregnancy.Note that Beta-Carotene is a Vitamin A derivative that is considered separately from the retinoids, and it is considered safe.I get asked a lot about Rosehip Oil as it is high in Vitamin A. All of the OBs I have asked about this specifically state that they consider it ok to use during pregnancy. Rosehip oil has trans-retinoic acid, not the beta-carotene we consider “safe” during pregnancy. Because Rosehips come from plants, the amount of the retinoid in the oil will vary based on how/where the plant is grown, how/when it is harvested and then how/when the oil is extracted. Lots of variables there. I consider it ok to use Rosehip Oil during pregnancy due to my discussions with OB. If it makes you nervous this is something that is easy to avoid.Note, Bakuchiol and Bidens Pilosa are ingredients that I am currently screening out as retinoids. Many brands are claiming this is a “natural retinoid” alternative that “works the same way as other retinoids”. I’ve confirmed that they do act through the same mechanism as retinoids. And there are zero studies proving that either is safe. I screen it as a retinoid and recommend avoidance. I frequently get readers arguing with me about this, I can only state what my opinion is and this is up to you. In the case of brands that don’t agree with me, this may be helpful: Why does X Brand say this product is safe but you don’t think it is safe? (or Vice Versa) Note, I’m adding Bidens Pilosa to the “avoid” list on 1/26/2022, it’s a very recent addition and I’ll seek out products that contain it and fix them in the lists.All Hydroxy Acids (Alpha, Beta and Poly)From malic acid to salicylic acid, pretty much all of the hydroxy acids either are not safe or simply don’t have enough information to say “sure, go crazy and rub this all over you.” So, the official word is that all of they hydroxy acids, alpha, beta and poly, have pregnancy categories that recommend avoidance.One exception is Lactic Acid, which your body makes on its own (I spend a lot of time in the PICU trying to prevent little bodies from making it, but that’s a whole different issue). Lactic acid has been shown to be fine in pregnant animals, but we don’t have evidence in humans. So, the official recommendation is to use with caution, but as it is found in your body anyways…. I don’t screen it out of products. It is in you already.I’ve seen a few books that say Glycolic Acid is fine, and there are many physicians that tell this to their patients, but it isn’t universally accepted. However, its official pregnancy category is that there isn’t enough info so should be avoided, especially since there is evidence that is is about 28% absorbed when used topically. The “correct” type of study to prove the safety of Glycolic Acid will simply never be done, so many physicians have looked at the current evidence and feel fine recommending it. I personally avoided it while pregnant and it’s one I look for when recommending products as safe or not.I also want to point out that Citric Acid is found usually in very small amounts at the very end of ingredient lists. It is typically there to help modulate pH in a product. You likely expose yourself to more Citric Acid in one glass of OJ than you would in a year of using such a product. I avoided it in my first 2 trimesters, but lightened up in my third trimester when I realized I was being a bit silly. I ignore it in products.The polyhydroxy acid that I currently screen out is gluconolactone.Hemp/CBDThere isn’t info out there on the safety of Cannabis used topically during pregnancy or nursing. We do know smoking marijuana with THC has bad effects and should be avoided, though it hasn’t been fully decided if it is just the THC or something else as well.Note that in theory Hemp and CBD do not have THC in them, it’s breed out of the plant is the official status. However, depending upon how it was processed there are CBD oils that test positive for THC. But there are still the unknowns we haven’t decided about. I would not recommend using Hemp or Cannabis products while nursing or pregnant for that reason. Note, this is a highly conservative opinion, but I’m skewed due to my position as a pediatrician.Sunless TannersDihydroxyacetone (DHA) and Erythrulose are the active ingredient in sunless tanners. The jury is still out on whether sunless tanners are safe at all, let along in pregnancy. I’ve seen sources that say yes for pregnancy (notably the NHS in the UK), but many that say no. My own OB was anti-sunless tanning while pregnant, it was listed on all of the handouts I was given by the University Clinic, most clinics in the US will state to avoid sunless tanners while pregnant. There is a risk of liver damage due to sunless tanners, even when not pregnant (though this risk is primarily from the sunless tanner pills). Yes, this includes the “natural” sugar products.I can tell you that my skin has taken on some interesting dry patches while pregnant, and it would be pretty hard to get an even sunless tan. This is a great time to embrace the pale, so I’m going with that.Skin Lighteners• Hydroquinone: A Tyrosinase inhibitor, this is widely listed as something to avoid in both pregnancy and nursing. Note that Alpha Arbutin is also a tyrosinase inhibitor, as is Kojic Acid.• Licorice Root also acts through inhibition of tyrosine. Note that licorice root extracts do also have other benefits such as antioxidant activity and it soothes skin. Licorice root seems to be present in many products, primarily for those other benefits and not the skin lightening effects. But that effect/mechanism is still there. There are several websites that say licorice root is safe for pregnancy, and it might be, but studies won’t be done to prove safety or danger. When looking for licorice root in an ingredient list, it often is in a chemical name like “Glycyrrh”. Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Glycyrrhiza Glabra are common examples of licorice root extracts.I err on the side of caution and include it on my list of ingredients to avoid. As I call out the ingredient of concern for every product, if you’re ok with Licorice root it is very easy for you to still use those products, just look for the ones where only licorice root is mentioned as a concern.Prostaglandin AnaloguesThis is an ingredient category that usually only comes up for lash serums, but this one to avoid due to potential changes in how blood moves around in a baby before birth. This is also why it is recommended to avoid salicylates.Benzoyl PeroxideAgain, I can’t find this in any actual drug reference books and a literature search didn’t turn up anything of use, but it is listed over and over on lists of things to avoid while pregnant.Laser TherapyI’ve seen laser therapy, whether for zapping away birth marks, tattoos or hair, listed over and over on lists of things to avoid while pregnant. As well, most places that offer lasers refuse to treat you if you are pregnant.I would likely reserve lasers (and at home machines) to be used under the direction of your physician. There is some evidence in the medical literature that laser treatment is safe during pregnancy.SalicylatesThis should include topical willow bark and should be avoided. I also include the related chemical sunscreen ingredients in this list as many are related. This is the same reason for avoidance as aspirin during pregnancy. (Which yes, is sometimes prescribed for pre-eclampsia, but that is a time that the risk/benefit ratio is closely monitored by a physician.)Things I just don’t know enough aboutI’m calling out these ingredients, but it’s really because I don’t have enough info and I’m not quite comfortable saying they’re definitely safe. Consider these to be “use at your own discretion” and know that I’m likely being overly cautious. If you’re ok with them, then you can ignore my warnings about them.Snail Secretion:First, can I say that I’m not really sure why we suddenly want to put slimy snail stuff on our faces? Who thought of that? It makes me chuckle. Second, we really don’t have a good handle on what is in it, and there’s absolutely no data about safety during pregnancy. I would avoid it.Stem CellsI am worried about these ingredients as they have no safety data, and if they work the way some companies say they work, then I’m not sure I want them on my skin when I’m not pregnant, but definitely NOT when I am pregnant!Those apple stem cells that are said to penetrate into your skin (which is a barrier by the way, how is a cell in a cream going to break the barrier function to penetrate deep into the dermis?), head to the dermis, where they “proliferate” (aka- multiply) and make the surrounding skin cells do stuff. If this really happened, how do those cells know where to stop? How do you know they aren’t being circulated and heading directly towards the placenta? And doesn’t that sound like apple cancer in your skin? I’d just avoid the whole thing. It’s important also to know that Stem Cells are not uniformly labelled in ingredients. Sometimes they are called stem cells, sometimes a “culture extract”, but not all culture extract is stem cells. When calling out stem cells, I look for anything that looks like stem cells in the ingredients, and also look at the write up on the website provided by the brand. They typically will call out stem cells, because they sound fancy. But sometimes not. And sometimes they will honestly change their website to go back and forth. (Note, this is not my fault, I have no control over the brands. I’ve had readers get mean with me about brands going back and forth.)Safe Skincare Ingredients During PregnancyThere are a few ingredients that I get asked about frequently. Based on the evidence there’s no reason to avoid these ingredients. There might be random websites that say to avoid them, some of them I can’t even locate the websites but I get asked a lot. These ingredients are safe.ParabensParabens are currently considered safe by pretty much everyone except the EWG, who have a big propaganda machine and I don’t think they interpret most studies correctly. If you disagree with me about that so be it, I’m just stating my opinion since I’ve been asked over and over. Parabens considered safe for pregnancy and breast feeding. BUT… if an ingredient makes you uncomfortable you should just avoid it. There are so many products on the market these days that it is very possible to do so without any issues.Hyaluronic AcidHyaluronic acid is basically the same thing as Sodium HyaluronateI can’t figure out how this became an ingredient that is sometimes on no-no lists, because not only does your body already make a ton of it, but is a big molecule. Huge. It is so large that it just hangs out in the spot where it is made, much too large to get into cells, to pass through membranes or travel to other locations.Much is the same for any Hyaluronic Acid that you apply to the surface of the skin. Your skin has very tight membrane junctions between those cells on the surface. Hyaluronic Acid can’t get through and just sits there on the surface of the skin. I’m always very suspicious when a company tells me that their HA is different and can get it. It’s a big red flag.So, since it can’t get in, and your body is already making it anyways, definitely feel that it is safe to keep using HA in your products. It just sits on the surface and helps hold moisture there. We need it to live up to pregnancy glow expectations!Sulfur:This is often found in acne treatments, and I haven’t really been able to find much info about safety in pregnancy. Be aware that if you’re allergic to sulfa drugs you should avoid this ingredient, but I’ve seen it as the active ingredient in many “pregnancy safe” acne treatments and is probably fine.Neem (Azadirachta indica):While I previously had been calling out Neem as something to watch, I’m not entirely certain upon review with OB friends. This was based on these studies (note, not in humans)- 1, 2, 3. I’ve decided to no longer call out neem as something to avoid until more information comes out.Caffeine:Yes, you can’t drink a lot of it during pregnancy. And it isn’t unusual to be concerned about using it topically during pregnancy. But it’s not the same as drinking it, your level of exposure is much lower by using it topically vs ingesting it, and the amount in an entire jar of eye cream is much lower than in a cup of coffee (which is 95 mg).Various Extracts and Essential OilsI am frequently asked about specific extracts. Note I’ve only really found convincing evidence that willow bark needs to be avoided in pregnancy, though there are various other websites out there that discuss avoiding specific ones.I would like to note that during pregnancy you’re a bit more likely to become sensitized/have a reaction to an extract. And what is in an extract exactly can vary depending on how the plant was grown, when it was harvested, how it was extracted, etc. There are a lot of variables. I’m not a big fan of a lot of extracts in my skincare for this reason, and my skin tends to be sensitive to them.Finally, I do want to point out that there is also moderation in all things. Many things can be more harmful especially in large amounts. I wouldn’t apply a lot of extracts or essential oils while pregnant. I’ve taken care of very ill children in my PICU due to this with “safe” oils such as tea tree oil. Things I get asked about that I am not worried aboutThere are many things out there about pregnancy safety (including this blog!) but I would point out that you should consider sources. My list is very conservative overall, but it’s also created by a physician.Ingredients that I have specifically been asked about but do not have enough evidence currently for me to screen them out: • Clary Sage • Propylene Glycol • Resveratrol • Rosemary (remember, you can still eat it, which is a much bigger exposure) • Phenoxyethanol • Phytic AcidThings I have some concerns about, but I’m not currently screening outThere are some ingredients that I don’t have enough information about to currently screen out, but I’m a bit leery of and I occasionally look into them to see if I need to start screening them out.• Neuropeptides: These are ingredients that are said to work like “botox in a bottle” and are known to absorb into the skin in order to work. It isn’t a big leap to say they’re likely circulated throughout the body, and who knows how it would affect a baby?• Tranexamic Acid: Note, this is often lumped in with the Tyrosinase inhibitors (Hydroquinone, Arbutin, Licorice Root and Kojic Acid) as they are all used to treat hyperpigmentation. However, Tranexamic Acid works via the plasminogen/plasmin pathway, so not really the same thing. Note, it is often taken by mouth as well, so that does make it a bit harder to look at info out there (because which application are you talking about?). You should be careful with this one if you have a history of blood clots, and that makes me a bit leery of it. I haven’t found enough information to recommend avoidance topically.• Lilial/ Butylphenyl Methylpropional: You likely learned about this ingredient when there was suddenly all of this news everywhere about Olaplex causing infertility. First, that’s unfair to pick on Olaplex (more in a minute), and also it’s a dramatic oversimplification of what’s going on.My favorite overview is in this IG post from Lab Muffin (a PhD in Chemistry who works in the cosmetic industry). She also discusses a little in this reel and this follow up reel.  But basically, when fed extremely large amounts of this chemical, rats had infertility. Rats are incredibly sensitive to things like this. Note, other animals were also tested, but only the rats had issues, and then it was with very high amounts. There’s no data to suggest any issues in humans directly, but if we assume people are as sensitive as rats, and then we try to get you to a small fraction of the dose needed for an exposure to cause an issue (ignoring that we’re talking about topical vs oral, which is very different in terms of absorption), and then we make that dose even smaller because we’re assuming that someone is somehow going to do something crazy and expose themselves even more…and also that you’re using 15 products with the ingredient (because Lilial is found in a large number of cosmetic but also household products, not just Olaplex. It’s a very common fragrance ingredient)…The EU is known for being particularly reactive/extremely cautious when it comes to reproductive side effects. I’m very conservative in my recommendations for the US, and they’re even more so than I am. You can read the full safety report here.Currently I’m not screening out this ingredient, and until there is more data about reproductive side effects (particularly with topical use and/or in humans) I’m not currently planning to do so. If the ingredient makes you uncomfortable, you can certainly screen it yourself. As well, since the ban was announced 2 years ago, brands have started reformulating. It’s no longer in Olaplex (and remember, it was in a lot more things that just Olaplex, and also your hair can’t absorb anything anyways). And finally, if you are planning to avoid it, I highly suggest you start with your perfumes, as that’s where you’ll find the highest concentration. I do NOT screen perfumes, instead I have other guidance for how to use your perfumes during pregnancy.

It was listed by my OB (at a major University health system) on a hand out given to all patients as an ingredient to avoid, and is very frequently mentioned as an ingredient to avoid elsewhere online and in books. Several of the ingredients on this list are in similar situations, but as I stated it would be nearly impossible to actually do those studies due to ethical concerns. 3.7.18Jemima said:Firstly, thank you for this information – very helpful indeed! I was wondering whether you have any advice re. makeup and it’s safety during pregnancy. I’ve read that some makeup can contain harmful ingredients such as formaldehyde and toluene. I, like you, am a bit of a makeup junkie and wouldn’t dream of leaving the house without mascara, concealer and my eyebrows done at the very least. Would you consider writing a blog on the subject with suggested products like you did for Pregnancy Safe Skincare (brilliant by the way)? 3.8.1815mins said:Most brands update their makeup formulas quite often and the ingredient lists are very difficult to find, so I haven’t been able to write such a post. I would not work about powders, brows and mascara for example as those will sit on the surface of the skin (or on the lashes, which are dead proteins basically), so not a concern. A quick note- We think of formaldehyde as toxic because it is used in embalming. Surely it must be horrible, right? The truth is that it is an additive to food, and your body is making it as a byproduct to normal processes. Large amounts obviously aren’t good, but even water is toxic in large amounts. 3.19.18sheri mortillaro said:I truly appreciate your website.

This review of ginseng during pregnancy is from 2008 and states that it is safe to ingest but to use with caution given some data in animals, but not much has come out since then. This article is from 2016 and shows that the “with caution” concerns for animals can only be found during pregnancy when you treat embryos with very high doses in petri dishes (aka- in vitro) before implanting into the actual animals. Those doses are impossible to reproduce in the animals. They also had the animals ingest large amounts and the same effects were NOT seen. As well, these effects have only been found in animals and with the petri dish treatment, topical treatment will be much lower amounts of absorption. 3.24.18Apple B said:This is a very informative post.

I can only find the key ingredients on the website so hopefully that will be ok. I’ve been using vitage essential cleansing balm (Natural Marula Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Bitter Orange Oil Almond Oil) and have asked them for advice using when pregnant as I was worried about the almond oil after googling it. They have said that their products are not tested on pregnant women and suggested vitage revitalising daily cleanse as it doesn’t have essential oils. (Sodium Hyaluronate, Aloe Vera, Brazilian Green Tea Extract, Rosamine Vitamin Cocktail, Glycerin)Could you let me know if either or both are safe and if not if there are any cleansing balms you would recommend for sensitive acneic skin? Thanks so much! 6.12.1815mins said:I think both are ok. I do agree in general with avoiding a lot of essential oils, especially while pregnant. They can be sensitizing, especially while pregnant. 6.12.18Steph said:Great thanks for replying! I’ll probably stick to the second one – I was a bit worried about the Brazilian green tea extract because I couldn’t find anything about applying it on the skin but some worries about drinking it. 6.14.18Cindy Valenzuela said:Hi, Thank God I came across your page.

I know tatcha violet C radiance mask has it, and thats on your pregnancy safe list. 7.7.1815mins said:When it’s part of a juice or extract it’s considered “ok”, since really it’s much more dilute then. You’re probably also still eating fruits and drinking juices anyways, and that’s going to be a much higher exposure since you’re drinking it rather than applying to your skin.

Thank you for taking the time out to put us expectant mothers at ease. I’ve developed very bad acne on my chest and shoulders since becoming pregnant. I treated the area with Epsom salts dissolved in warm water by spraying the solution onto my skin after showering. It’s effective in drying out my pimples but not stopping new ones forming. I waited until I entered my 2nd trimester before trying topical acne cleansers. The pharmacist gave me BENZAC Daily Facial Foam Cleanser. I’ve been using it a week now and my condition is getting better, I’m just concerned there might be some nasties in the ingredients that I should be aware of.

It actually isn’t really an acid as you think of an acid, it is a very large molecule (already made by your body, it is found in the dermis especially), and it holds on to water to hydrate the skin. It is so large that it can’t penetrate into the skin even when hydrolyzed or nano sized. It’s actually one of my favorite moisturizing ingredients because it does such a great job without feeling heavy on your skin (it’s in the 2nd product above).For these products I would avoid the Essence (due to licorice root), the other two both look ok to me. 9.21.18Bellbell said:Hi,Thank you for the sharing.

All of those products look ok to me 10.10.18Lyv said:Thanks a lot!!Just to confirm, because I don’t know much about that, but I am dying to try rosehip oil, I’ve read reviews, they say its awesome for the face.Let me generalize my thoughts after some reading, then you correct me, if you can. Rosehip oil = vitamin A = retinol = dangerI want to try the rosehip oil, but I don’t want to take chances. Please make me understand, lol. 10.10.1815mins said:No, Rosehip Oil = fatty acids, good for hydration and preserving your skin’s barrier function, which makes happy skin. There are vitamins in there, and Vitamin A is included, but it isn’t thought to be close enough (or enough in amount) to really be counted as a retinoid by most dermatologists whenever I’ve talked to them about it. Vitamin A is also Beta Carotene, which is fine in pregnancy.I’m editing my comment to add that Vitamin A is naturally found in a lot of plants and fruits, and we’ll all go crazy if we start looking at it in each of those. The amount and kind can vary based on when things were harvested, how they were extracted, etc. It’s kind of assumed to not be enough to really “count”. If that makes sense. 10.12.18Lyv said:Thanks!!What about this product: Ingredients: Water, Diglycerin, Glycerin, Tranexamic Acid, Butylene Glycol, PEG-8, PEG-6, PEG-32, PPG- 24- Glycereth-24, Methylparaben, Carbomer, Poly- sorbate 20, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate 10.12.1815mins said:I would avoid that due to the Tranexamic Acid. It’s a lysine derivative thought to maybe improve skin tone, but it is used postpartum to prevent hemorrhage/promote blood clotting. I have no idea what that would do while pregnant, but pregnancy is already a pro-thrombotic state and I don’t think you should be messing with the normal clotting cascade while pregnant. 10.14.18Lyv said:I have checked your list of The Ordinary products allowed during pregnancy, but these two products are not listed:1) 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder Ingredients: Ascorbic Acid2) Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3% Ingredients: Propanediol, Resveratrol, Ferulic Acid.Is any of those allowed?Also, I saw that the Ordinary`s Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% is allowed.

First, as a physician, knowing how much of a barrier the skin is for most ingredients, the idea that apple cells will go down into the dermis seems a bit absurd (a dermatologist friend laughed at me when I asked her about it), but even if it actually does do that, how does the apple cell know where to stop? Those are some whacky apple cells. Who knows what/where they’re going. So I haven’t included any of the products from that line.The Drunk Elephant eye cream didn’t make the cut because of a licorice root extract.Please know that reviewing a product can take me 10-30 minutes or even longer depending on the ingredient list. I have not made these decisions lightly. 10.14.18Resham K. said:Hi, I am in the first trimester of pregnancy, I I live in Dubai, UAE and have been really worried about the right sunscreen to use and finally plan to use SkinCeuticals Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50..

I recently received some prickly pear oil products as a gift and am wondering if it’s OK for pregnancy / nursing. I’ve read that some essential oils are outright bad but have found very little reputable commentary relating to prickly pear oil, so I’m interested in what your take on it is! 10.30.1815mins said:There’s a lot of opinion out there about various essential oils and I can’t seem to find much actual data about most of them. For sure avoid Neem and Willow Bark extracts. Others I wouldn’t use in large quantities, even the “safe” ones such as tea tree oil can cause issues in large amounts. In small amounts in products most are fine. I don’t have any info to suggest you need to avoid prickly pear. 10.26.18Ashley said:Hi! Is Bio Oil for stretch marks considered safe or no? 10.27.1815mins said:No, it has a retinol in it. They make a big deal about it being the best thing for stretch marks (this and Palmer’s Cocoa Butter market on that) but there have been studies about both, nothing really “works” to prevent stretch marks any better than just using a good moisturizer and massaging it in. 🙂 10.27.18Lara said:I am looking for an acne spot treatment but I can’t use most because they contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.

As I were adding these 2 products into my cart and input my California address, there was this very confusing warning showed up: “one or more of the products in your bag may expose you to chemicals including lead, bisphenol A, phthalates or cadmium, which is known to the State of California to cause cancer or birth defects. For more information, go to http://www.p65warnings.ca.gov” I also tried to access the website and searched for ‘ascorbyl’, ‘tetraisopalmitate’ or ‘viatmin F’, but nothing came up.

How much of these acids can actually be absorbed by the skin? 11.7.1815mins said:The shampoo is mostly on your hair, not the scalp. face washes are much more likely to leave some behind. They can all be absorbed. Citric acid is in food, so you don’t need to worry about it, Salicylic acid isn’t in food as much but since salicylates have actual known detrimental effects “extra” should be avoided. 11.8.18sara said:hello doctor,are this ingrediants safe to use use during pregrancy sodium plamate ,sodium cocoate/sodium palm kernelate,aqua,glycerin,punis palustris wood tar ,sodium chloride,soduim gluconate 11.8.1815mins said:These are fine 11.8.18Katherine Dos Santos said:Hello,Are these ingredients safe to use during pregnancy?Aqua, Cetearyl, Glyceria Stearate, Behentrimonium Methylisothyazolinone and Methylclorisotyazolinone, Polyquaternium 6-7, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Peg 12- Dimethicone, Hydroxypropyl Guar, Acid Violet 43, Parfummalic acid, Acetic Acid, Citric Acid, Lactic Acid. 11.9.1815mins said:It’s ok. 11.10.18Nicole said:Hi,A few websites advise that we should avoid anything with a PEG ingredient (regardless of whether it’s something like PEG-16 or PEG-60).I was wondering what your thoughts were on PEGs?Thanks, Nicole 11.10.1815mins said:PEGs are usually very large and can’t be absorbed, no evidence to avoid them.

I struggle to find something ‘safe’.. 11.25.1815mins said:1) All of these products are fine 2) Yes, definitely sunscreen all the time! The hormones are out of control and you’ll be prone to hyperpigmentation/melasma without. I have a list of pregnancy safe sunscreens. 3) I would be careful with all essential oils. Pregnancy is a very “sensitizing” time period (aka- a great time to react to things you haven’t reacted to before and you’ll react to them later too). 4) I have a big list of pregnancy safe skincare products, lots of moisturizing creams in there 🙂 5) Being safe and careful is good while pregnant, but you should know that your previous pregnancy with a chromosomal issue was not your fault, could not have been prevented and has nothing to do with anything you did. Absolutely not. I know it was hard to go through, and makes you treasure the baby you are currently pregnant with even more, and that is wonderful! But if no one has told you yet, it was not your fault. Nothing you did caused it or could have prevented it.

Your like a preggers skin gift from the gods! 1.5.19Anna said:I am currently nursing. I know there are specific essential oils and extracts that are unsafe during pregnancy and nursing, but what about when these oils or extracts are in cosmetic formulations rather than directly applied? So for example, is a face lotion with ginseng extract safe during nursing? What about a body wash with wintergreen oil? Is the concentration low enough that it should be ok or is there room for concern regardless of the dilution in products? Thanks! 1.5.1915mins said:Those ones actually are mentioned on a few websites, but I’ve never found “official” recs to avoid them. I don’t recommend using them straight, pretty much ever. Even “safe” ones like tea tree oil can be dangerous (I once had a kid on a ventilator on a coma for a few days in my ICU due to tea tree oil, scary!) But small amounts in products should be fine. The exceptions to that are in the post above, namely willow bark (salicylates) and I would likely avoid Neem. 1.5.19Anna said:Thank you! 1.8.19Belinda said:Hi Christine,I stumble across your blog by chance.

It is so generous of you to spend your time and expertise on this important topic. My question is about the ingredient “chlorphenesin” . Its a preservative in quite a few products including some of my favorites from “The Ordinary” which otherwise would probably be considered pregnancy safe. (I’ll paste an example below, but I hope this is the right thread because my question is about the ingredient, not the product. I found your page on this brand and it has all the answers I need, thank you for that!) I’m sure you are better equipped than I to determine which information is reliable, but some websites say it is a muscle relaxant that can cause shallow breathing in infants and it should be avoided during pregnancy. My question is, do you think products formulated with chlorphenesin should be avoided during pregnancy?One Example: The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc: Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin. 2.5.1915mins said:I don’t, primarily because the only time anything has been described (and from what I have read it was more of a theoretical risk than any issues with any babies) the babies were actually ingesting large amounts of the product. Eating and applying something to the skin are 2 very different things, the mucosal membranes are built to absorb where the skin’s primary function is to act as a barrier. The amount of the ingredient that can get into the baby is also very different if it is going through your own blood stream first before having to go through the placenta as well…. This isn’t something that is ever mentioned as an ingredient to avoid while pregnant for those reasons, but if you’re worried about it you could certainly avoid using those products. I haven’t seen Chlorphenesin used frequently, mostly The Ordinary as it is a fairly cheap ingredient I think. 2.6.19Deidre said:Thank you that really clarifies things for me, I appreciate it! 2.6.19Roxy said:Hi!
