However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.While a full glam is always appreciated, right now, we’re leaning into a your-skin-but-better minimalism that feels lightweight and effortless. Thankfully, the rise in multipurpose makeup stick and pigments make achieving the look that much simpler.Whether you want a return to office makeup routine that takes just a couple of minutes or you’re preserving precious space in your carry-on—meaning you must parse your beauty regimen down to just a few TSA-friendly products. In either case, a versatile product makes all the difference in applying a wash of color across your cheeks, lips, or eyes.“As someone who is always on the go, a single product that works three ways is ideal for speeding up my beauty routine!” says celebrity makeup artist Jen Tioseco. Perfect for the minimalist or lazy, effortless makeup, these will surely work overtime in your regimen. Tioseco is a fan of cream formulas and notes that they can be seamlessly used in multiple ways—like the best cream blush you might already be accustomed to.Even more, warmer temperatures offer ample time to experiment with weightless, dewy coverage as opposed to powder or matte formulas—especially because the pigments are typically formulated as creams or liquids that can be blended without beauty tools. “I personally love using my fingers to apply a cream stick as it helps warm the product up for an effortless application!” Tioseco notes. Though if you are more of a makeup brush person, she’d recommend a dual-sized makeup brush. “You can use the larger side for the cheeks and the smaller side for your lips and eyelids!”And voila, a wash of color wherever you’d like, simple enough that anyone could master. Read on to discover the all-purpose pigments to consider all spring and summer.Ilia Multi-StickIlia’s Multi-Stick is certainly a Vogue editor and industry favorite. Available in 12 shades and infused with a blend of botanical oils, the formula offers blendable color sans makeup brushes.
