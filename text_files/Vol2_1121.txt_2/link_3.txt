10 Recipes to Make with Cetyl Alcohol
 by Marie | Jun 20, 2019 | General DIY | 16 comments







If you’re on the fence about investing in some cetyl alcohol I’m hoping this post can help convince you to pick up a couple ounces of the stuff. I first started working with cetyl alcohol in early 2017 and it has quickly become something I’ll never want to be without. It’s inexpensive (a kilo/roughly 2lbs is typically in the $11–13 range), has a long shelf life, and is insanely versatile. I use it in everything from lotions to balms to shampoo bars, and it tends to make everything better!


Cetyl alcohol is a lightweight fatty thickener of vegetable origin. You’ll purchase it in white pellets; I’ve had both larger ones (pictured) and teesny little spheres. I started my relationship with it with a simple get-to-know-you kind of experiment (click this link!). I combined cetyl alcohol with different amounts of liquid oil to see how it worked as a thickener. What percentage of cetyl alcohol resulted in something solid? Soft solid? Firm? How did the mixtures feel? How did they melt?




The results were very cool. Unlike waxes, which add weight and skid along with thickening, cetyl alcohol has an amazing slippy, silky, almost powdery skin feel. It’s wonderfully lightweight, giving thickening/hardening without tackiness or heft. It’s so dang cool! In emulsions 3–4% adds wonderful lightweight thickening to the end product, making it thicker without making it heavier. In anhydrous products it improves slip and skin feel along with thickening/solidifying the end product. It’s really dang cool.
As my love affair with cetyl alcohol continues I thought I’d share ten of the best formulas I’ve shared using it over the past couple years. I hope this collection of recipes will give you an appreciation for all the different things cetyl alcohol can do, and all the different places it can shine!

Solid Olive Primrose Facial Serum
This beautiful solid serum is thickened using cetyl alcohol. Thanks to its silky finish and incredibly lightweight thickening this gives us an end product that is solid, but not at all heavy—it has the same lightweight feel of a liquid oil serum, but it’s much harder to spill!

Snowy Dawn Cream Luminizer
I really capitalized on cetyl alcohol’s powdery, silky finish for this solid luminizer. It comes together like a cream, but applies in a fantastic cream-to-powder way. The cetyl alcohol pairs beautifully with the silica microspheres for a divinely silky, powdery skin feel!

Soothing Cedarwood Ointment
This creamy ointment combines beeswax and cetyl alcohol for a unique thickening experience and skin feel. The cetyl alcohol helps lighten the beeswax and improve slip—beeswax can be a bit draggy, while cetyl alcohol is ultra silky, so they’re a great combination. The end product is creamy and almost gel-like, which is super cool!

Coconut Massage Butter
Massage things need to be ultra-slippy, so cetyl alcohol was an obvious choice here! Paired with silky coconut oil and conditioning BTMS-50 this massage butter is utterly divine. It smells softly of coconuts and has slip for daaaaaays. Awwww yeah.

Sugar Plum Conditioning Body Butter
I am so in love with conditioning body butters. A blend of cationic BTMS-50, ultra-silky cetyl alcohol, and lightweight oils and butters creates a body butter with a stunning dry-touch finish that leaves your skin feeling downright divine. Make sure you follow the chilling procedure fully so the end product stays silky smooth. Prepare to fall in love!

Conditioning Super Nourishing Hair Balm
This formula is an update of one of my earliest DIYs, and one of the best things I did with the new version was lighten it up by dialling back the beeswax, which can be a bit heavy for hair, and replacing some of that thickening power with a blend of powdery cetyl alcohol and creamy stearic acid, making more a more buttery balm. I also added some BTMS-50 so this balm ends up being like a touch of solid hair conditioner. Also, it smells amazeballs.

Soothing Cleansing Balm
If you are a cleansing balm kind of person you’re going to love the soft, creamy consistency of this delightful Soothing Cleansing Balm. Kelly made it and said “I just made this over the weekend and I LOVE the texture. Neat-o! Almost like ice cream that you leave out for 5 minutes  I usually avoid cleansing balms because many have beeswax and I don’t like the feel of that on my face. This one is very creamy, cleanses really well, and is easy to wash off. I used calendula infused in sunflower oil because that’s what I had on hand. Thanks so much Marie for one fantastic recipe!!”

Mango Mango Shampoo Bar
Cetyl alcohol helps harden this cheery orange shampoo bar without any added weight or grabbiness, making for a firm bar that will last a long time in your shower! Hana made this formula and shared “I absolutely of this! My hair is very fine and gets oily at the crown and dry at the ends. This shampoo lathers up beautifully and doesn’t leave a film… It left my hair clean, silky, not dry and crunchy. Thank you Marie!”

Lemon Chiffon Body and Hand Lotion
This lotion is a fantastic formula for demonstrating the amazing things a small amount of cetyl alcohol can contribute to a batch of lotion. Missy made it and said “HI Marie! I made this today and it is amazing! My very first lotion! I can’t believe how non-greasy it feels and how wonderful it smells.” You should probably make it, too 😉

Airbrushing Primer Stick
This silky mid-coverage primer/foundation sort of makeup concoction is one of my favourite things. It has an ultra light skin feel thanks to the glidey cetyl alcohol, which provides almost weightless thickening/hardening (the silky silica microspheres also help!). You can make it in a stick or a compact and it’ll provide some coverage + lots of optical blurring and oil control. Love!

Hi Marie, love this post! A question though. What do you think of using cetyl alcohol in lip balms? Have you ever tried it? Is there a reason not to?
Thanks for all the info and recipes!

Hey Laurel! You definitely can use cetyl alcohol in lip balms—I haven’t, but that’s because cetyl alcohol makes super lightweight, glossy things (like this) and I usually want a bit more creamy oomph in my lip balms 🙂 Happy making!

Hi,
The cetyl alcohol I use is from Voyageur and looks more like a fine salt than pellets. I doubt it makes a difference, but thought I’d double check.
Thanks!

That’s all good! The first batch of cetyl alcohol I had was much finer, as you can see in the photos from my initial experiments with it 🙂 Happy making!

Hi Marie,
Great post as always! Do you know how to calculate melting point of Cetyl Alcohol in a balm? or actually the melting point for the overall balm in general. I made the cleansing balm following your recipe and it melted during the hot California weather. Curious if it would help to adjust any of the ingredients to increase the melting point for a stable final product that would last in any kind of weather. Any pointer would be greatly appreciated!

Marie 
					on June 25, 2019 at 10:48 am				



I’m afraid I don’t—my understanding is that it’s not quite as simple as proportionately averaging out the melting points of all the ingredients in a formula, though that might be a decent way to guestimate. You might also find this FAQ useful 🙂 Happy making!

What is everyones input on cetyl alcohol when it comes to lotion bars? Seems like whipped body butters and lotion bars or butter bars are similar just one more solid and not whipped. I am doing one with oils/butters  and beeswax and want to incorporate some cetyl alcohol into it. Please let me know your thoughts on this and percentages %. Thank you

Can cetyl alcohol be used as a thickener in liquid shampoo or body wash? If so, at what percentage?
Reply 






 

Marie 
					on March 12, 2021 at 9:32 am				



That’s a great big “it depends”, I’m afraid 🙂 It can work in some formulations, but it would not be my first choice for most liquid surfactant products. Check out the formulations I have done (use the main menu to navigate to sections like “shampoo” and “body wash”) to see approaches that work 🙂

Hi  can I use cetyl alcohol in a black soap shampoo as an emulsifier

Marie

No, as cetyl alcohol is not an emulsifier.

Can I make body lotion with cetyl
 Alcohol? And is there a recipe for
 Eczema?

Hi Bill! I’ve shared many lotion formulations using cetyl alcohol; theres a list at the bottom of the Humblebee & Me DIY Encyclopedia (https://www.humblebeeandme.com/diy-encyclopedia/) entry on cetyl alcohol 🙂
I cannot claim anything I does treats eczema as that is a drug claim. Whatever you make, I’d recommend leaving out any essential oils or fragrance oils to reduce irritation potential 🙂 Happy making!
