WHAT IS CETYL ALCOHOL?
It is common for Cetyl Alcohol to be wrongly understood as the type of alcohol that has drying effects on the skin, such as rubbing alcohol; however, on the contrary, Cetyl Alcohol is skin-friendly with hydrating, conditioning, and softening properties that benefit both skin and hair. It is an alcohol that is derived from a fat, such as a vegetable oil like Coconut Oil or Palm Oil; hence it is also called Palmityl Alcohol. Not to be mistaken for Ethyl Alcohol – the main ingredient in alcoholic beverages – Cetyl Alcohol receives its name from the Latin word cetus, meaning “whale oil,” as this was the substance from which Cetyl Alcohol was first obtained. NDA’s Cetyl Alchol Raw Material is available in the form of unscented flakes or pellets that, at room temperature, are waxy in texture and white in color.


 
HOW DOES CETYL ALCOHOL WORK?
When Cetyl Alcohol is added to natural cosmetic preparations, it functions as an agent that helps homogenize components that naturally separate (emulsifier), as a soothing lubricant (emollient), as a thickener, as an opacifier, and as a carrier for other ingredients in a formula. These stabilizing properties ensure that the oils and water remain combined, thus promoting an ideal, smooth texture that ultimately gives the final product an easy glide on the skin or hair.


 
BENEFITS OF CETYL ALCOHOL
 

 
It contributes to their thickness and volume while enhancing their textures and spreadability. Furthermore, by helping the skin retain moisture, it promotes softness and smoothness.


 
APPLICATIONS FOR CETYL ALCOHOL
Cetyl Alcohol must be added to formulations in their heated oil phases. The higher the concentration of Cetyl Alcohol, the thicker the end product will be.
