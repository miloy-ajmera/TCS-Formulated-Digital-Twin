Be careful! It REALLY works!
Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2023Verified Purchase
I'm 45 and have started seeing fine lines and crepe-y looking skin on my upper eyelids, as well as a bit deeper smile lines and puffiness in my under eye area. I started using this product about 6 weeks ago. My under eye area is SO smooth now! The patch of wrinkles at each outer corner is nearly diminished! It's truly incredible! However, at no fault to this product, my upper eyelids haven't fared so well. For the past couple weeks, they have been itching, peeling, burning, they are red and swollen, they overall just look terrible. I've heard that when using retinoids, sometimes it gets worse before it gets better, but I think this might be beyond that. Take it easy with this cream! I've been using antibiotic ointment on them at night hoping to get back to normal. This stuff is no joke! I would suggest using it only every few days to start out, and go from there. You will see results!!

It actually works to lighten dark circles!
Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2022Verified Purchase
I'm amazed this product has actually lightened the dark circles under my eyes! I was extremely skeptical, but I read about it in an article that called it the cheap alternative to creams that said they did the same thing. I checked and others are $80+. I wanted to try something more reasonably priced first.The instructions said it would take four weeks to show signs of improvement and it did. I stuck with it because I was very unhappy with the dark circles I got right around the time I turned 50.I don't ever wear makeup so concealer wasn't an option. I needed something that solved the problem in a larger way.I found a solution! The dark circles aren't gone, but they're quite a bit lighter which makes me feel great! I think it improved the puffiness under my eyes too but the dark circles were my main concern.I highly recommend it. For once a product does what it says it does. This one is even a decent price!

A bit iffy on the NO SEAL!!! Looks used!!! 2 stars as of now. Smells good. Eyes felt great this morning and very soft. Only used last night as I just got it yesterday. Reviews are a hit here and a miss there. DONT LIKE THE NO SEAL THO!!!!!! You can't even get a fresh donut these days that isn't individually wrapped in plastic,,, so the no seal concerns me considering this is EYE CREAM!!!! I'll re review in a week with or without results.For in the future,, because I am a REGULAR costumer PLEASE don't send me USED anything from someone else unless I choose that option before hitting the purchase button😔

If only it came in a 32 Oz jar and I could afford it. I’d bathe in this stuff. It comes in a tiny container that I promptly spread all over my face and neck. Looking cute!!!! Try it, you’ll love it.
