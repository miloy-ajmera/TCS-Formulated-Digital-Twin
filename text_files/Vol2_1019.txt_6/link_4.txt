Cream v9 quickly restores barrier function of damaged skin, deeply nourishes and protects. Our formula features saccharide isomerate -a carbohydrate complex which helps bind moisture to the skin, providing long lasting hydration. Ceramide 3 replenishes the skins lipid layer, which creates a plumping effect. Black currant seed and raspberry seed oils deeply nourish and deliver a potent dose of antioxidants, brightening the skin and protecting it from environmental damage. Resveratrol supports the skins structure and elasticity, which helps improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

 
HOW TO USE
Day and night.
After cleansing and applying serums gently massage a small amount of Cream V9 onto your face, neck and décolleté. 
 

KEY INGREDIENTS


Ceramide 3

Resveratrol
