We like to think of Vaseline as the OG moisturizer. It dates back to 1865 when chemist Robert Chesebrough patented the petroleum jelly formula to heal dry skin. But since its invention, we've found so many other Vaseline uses that don't just pertain to skincare—seriously, its limits are boundless.


Good old-fashioned Vaseline ($4) is one multitasking beauty product that has so many uses, and we've rounded up 18 of our favorite uses for the stuff that feels almost life-changing. Keep scrolling for some of the best and most unexpected uses for Vaseline.





01
of 18


   Prep Skin for Fragrance  

Moisturized skin may hold scents better, so rub some Vaseline on your pulse points before you spritz to make your fragrance last longer. Pulse points "are warm areas that help diffuse the fragrance across the body," says Petrillo. They include the wrists, inner elbows, back of the knees, and neck.

   Tame Your Hair  

Use Vaseline to try to tame frizz and seal dry, split ends, and even to keep unruly eyebrows in place. Since it's safe to use on the face, you don't have to worry about irritation if you get any on your skin. However, Obioha says to be careful if your pores are easily clogged. "I do not recommend applying Vaseline to your face as a moisturizer if you have oily, acne-prone skin."


Dermatologist Dendy Engelman, MD, adds, "Vaseline is non-comedogenic so it is safe for all skin types. However, it is most beneficial for wounds and dryness. If you’re trying to get rid of acne, there are plenty of other better suited, active ingredients."

   DIY Highlighter  

Swap your highlighter for Vaseline. Just dab a small amount on the high points of your face for a dewy, naturally luminous glow. Keep in mind that Vaseline may clog some peoples' pores, so if that seems like it could happen to you, maybe don't follow this tip, or at least go very lightly. A great alternative can be found in the cult-loved Weleda Skinfood ($19).






04

   Stain Remover  

With a damp washcloth, Vaseline can be used to lift makeup stains from your clothes as well as pillows, blankets, and sheets. "The oil in petroleum jelly will help draw out other oils from stubborn makeup stains," says Petrillo. Throw it in the washing machine after treating the stain to ensure you completely remove it.






05

   Clean Up Your Manicure  

Apply Vaseline to your cuticles before polishing your nails to keep color off of the skin around your nails. You'll get a perfect manicure—minus the cleanup. It's also great for keeping your hands and nails in manicure-ready shape, says Petrillo. "Petroleum jelly can be a great solution to fixing dry nail beds and cuticles by speeding up the healing process."

   Dry Skin Healer  

"Vaseline is incredibly effective at softening severely cracked, dry, and inflamed areas. It also works by preventing loss of water in the skin, which allows natural oils to nourish and repair," says Engelman. Smooth Vaseline over cracked heels or dry elbows, slip on a pair of socks, go to sleep, and wake up to healthy, hydrated skin. Keep in mind that while Vaseline might soothe the irritation from dry skin or chapped lips, it won't moisturize on its own. "Vaseline works by sealing in moisture that is already present in the skin. It does not, however, bring moisture to the skin," says Petrillo. Layer it with a moisturizer for best results.



"For my dry skin and eczema-prone patients, I recommend mixing Vaseline with moisturizing cream and using it as a daily moisturizer," says Obioha.

   Customize Your Cosmetics  

Turn any of your favorite loose pigments into cream eye shadow or blush by mixing them with Vaseline. It's safe to use around the eye area, according to our experts, so you don't have to worry about causing infection. You can also make a tinted lip balm this way. But our favorite application is combining Vaseline with a shimmery pigment like Vanilla from MAC to create a dewy highlight.

   Lash Conditioner  

Vaseline can also be safely applied to the lashes. "Many salons and spas use Vaseline or petroleum jelly-like products around areas (eyes, nose, mouth) that need to be protected from treatment," adds Engelman. If you're embracing the no-makeup look, trade your mascara for Vaseline. Smooth it over your lashes for a fuller set of dark, glossy eyelashes. Bonus: Vaseline may also make a great lash conditioner.

   Leather Polish  

Scuffed shoes? Buff a little Vaseline onto boots, shoes, bags, and any other leather goods that need polishing.

   Achieve the Perfect Self-Tanner Application  

Use a small amount of Vaseline on dry spots before applying self-tanner. It will act as a barrier, preventing streaks and stains in areas the self-tanning product would otherwise cling to.



Apply Vaseline around the hairline before applying at-home color to try to prevent hair-dye stains.

   A Gentle Makeup Remover  

Makeup remover can be expensive and tough on your eyes. Vaseline is an inexpensive option that easily and gently removes eyeliner, mascara, shadow, and even the eyelash glue your falsies leave behind. Engelman agrees that it can be used "to dissolve and break down makeup."

   Ear and Jewelry Care  

If you don't wear earrings very often, those holes can become troublesome. Rub Vaseline over your earlobes and the earring first to help it slide in painlessly. Obioha notes that petroleum jelly can promote wound healing, including "after lasers and skin biopsies." Vaseline can also help you take off a stuck-on ring—just another brilliant use!

   DIY Scrubs  

Dry lips? Vaseline can be a great fix, according to our experts. Add a bit of sugar to your Vaseline to make your own lip scrub. Or mix it with sea salt and use the mixture in the shower as a body scrub with moisturizing benefits. "Consistently monitoring your skin (knuckles, heels, elbows) for dryness and supplementing with Vaseline will help to prevent skin from cracking to begin with," notes Engelman.

   Prevent Nail Polish Bottles From Sticking  

Another expert sleeper use for Vaseline? Smooth a dab under the cap of your nail polish to prevent dried lacquer from making the bottle impossible to open. Yes, the polish will stay fresh forever. Or at least pretty darn close.

   Prevent Rusting Razor Blades  

Keep your razors like new by carefully smoothing a very thin layer of Vaseline onto the blades between uses. Make sure they're completely dry first to prevent rust. Seriously, it's one of the slickest (literally) uses for Vaseline we've ever discovered. Praise be.

   Soften Feet  

Soften dry, cracked feet by applying a coat of Vaseline at night and wearing socks to bed. This overnight treatment will help lock in moisture and give you smoother, softer soles by morning.

   Avoid Chafing  

Apply Vaseline to the thighs, underarms, or anywhere else you're prone to chafing to reduce friction and keep skin moisturized.

   Protect Your Skin Barrier  

Slugging is a popular moisturizing method where an occlusive product, such as Vaseline, is applied on top of the skin at the end of your skincare routine to lock in moisture and help protect the skin barrier. Since Vaseline is non-comedogenic, it won't clog pores, but slugging isn't advised for those with an oiler skin type.
