But did you know you can use it for so much more than just chapped lips? Check out these so-simple, expert-approved beauty hacks to try with Vaseline.Use it as highlighter. When Kim Kardashian's makeup artist, Mario Dedivanovic, wants to create what he calls "expensive skin," ironically, he uses this very affordable petroleum jelly. "I pat it right along the cheekbones, which gives you the most alluring, gorgeous glow," he told Page Six.Make your eye shadow brighter. Spread a very small amount of Vaseline on your lids before applying your eye shadow as you normally would and behold — the color looks so much more rich and vibrant. "It really does the trick," says Allure digital beauty reporter Devon Abelman, who cautions against a thick layer unless you're going for a glossy look.Remove your eye makeup. Not only can you use Vaseline before applying eye shadow, but you can also use the jelly to remove it — and eyeliner and mascara — in one of the gentlest ways available. "It's light and lubricated, so the makeup slides right off without harming the skin," dermatologist Mona Gohara told Allure.Calm down cystic acne. It may be scary to apply something sorta greasy to breakout-prone skin, but Vaseline "may actually help maintain healthy skin-barrier function, as the skin is inflamed," according to dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, who says that cosmetic-grade petroleum jelly should not clog your pores. Try it as the last layer in your nighttime skin-care routine to help seal in the ingredients of your clarifying products.Moisturize under your eyes. After you're done dabbing Vaseline on any zits, sweep a layer under your eyes, too. Dermatologist Michele Green told Allure that petrolatum locks in moisture so that by morning, dryness has disappeared.Keep a manicure clean. Apply Vaseline to the skin around your nails before you start painting as a way to catch stray polish. Once your manicure is dry, you can simply wipe away any smudges without remover.Extend the life of your perfume. A dab of Vaseline on your wrists and neck can work like a fragrance primer, cosmetic chemist Ron Robinson says, because it prevents scent molecules from evaporating as quickly as they would on bare skin.Bulk up your brows. Can't find your brow gel or pomade? Smooth a little Vaseline over your eyebrows to not only keep them in place all day but make them look longer and thicker without any added color.You can pick up a 13-ounce tub of Vaseline pretty much anywhere for about $4.More must-know Vaseline info:This K-Pop Star Uses Just One Drugstore Product to Get Her Glass SkinThe 10 Best Unexpected Uses for Vaseline, According to PinterestThis Video of a Knife Slicing a Vaseline Tub Is Oddly MesmerizingNow watch Lauren Cohan try nine things she's never done before:Follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter, or subscribe to our newsletter for daily beauty stories delivered right to your inbox.Marci Robin is a contributing editor at Allure.
