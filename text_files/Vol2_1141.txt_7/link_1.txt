 Skin & Beauty7 Skin Care Ingredients That Can Trigger Allergic ReactionsBy Virginia Sole-SmithReviewed: September 8, 2014Fact-CheckedWhat’s Frustrating Your Skin?Kathrin Ziegler/Getty ImagesIf opening up your cosmetics bag feels akin to crossing a minefield because you’re never sure which product might trigger an itchy rash or painful breakout, it’s time to get a better handle on your beauty allergies. As many as 24 percent of Americans will experience an allergic skin reaction at some point during their lives, which isn’t surprising when you consider that more than 3,700 substances have been identified as contact allergens — meaning they can trigger a rash or other skin reaction — and quite a few of them live in the beauty products you use every day. Fortunately, the more you know, the easier it is to sidestep problems. Here are some of the most common irritating ingredients — and soothing alternatives.Aluminum CompoundsBetsie Van der Meer/Getty ImagesIf your armpits get red or start to peel every time you roll on your antiperspirant, you may be allergic to the aluminum compounds in most of them, says Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in the dermatology department at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. Unfortunately, the more powerful your wetness protection, the more likely you are to have a reaction.Soothing swap: Use a natural deodorant like Tom’s of Maine or Arm & Hammer. “They do a fine job of masking odor but aren’t great at preventing sweating,” Zeichner notes. If you find that you’ve got pit stains, try Dove’s sensitive skin antiperspirant, which you may be able to tolerate as it has very low levels of aluminum.AcidsScott Kleinman/Getty ImagesIt stands to reason that any product designed to slough off your skin cells might occasionally do more harm than good. This list includes salicylic acid, an oil-soluble beta-hydroxy acid used to treat acne and oily skin; topical retinoids, which normalize skin cell maturation and help promote collagen stimulation; and glycolic acid, a water-soluble alpha-hydroxy acid that is the active ingredient in most chemical peels. “All of these can cause skin irritation, dryness, redness and/or burning if you over-use them,” says Zeichner.Soothing swap: Consult your dermatologist and follow usage instructions carefully with any at-home topicals containing salicylic acid or retinoids. You may need to start with fewer applications and gradually build up to more, or decrease to every other day or every few days to find a level your skin can tolerate. If you have an allergic reaction to a glycolic peel, try a vitamin C or fruit enzyme peel — or stick to non-chemical forms of exfoliation like a gentle scrub.FragranceGetty ImagesSynthetic fragrance ingredients can trigger irritation in over 20 percent of the American population, say environmental health researchers at the University of Washington, causing skin rashes, as well as headaches, coughing, wheezing, and other respiratory irritation. “And fragrance doesn’t just mean perfume — it’s used in almost every beauty product under the sun,” says Siobhan O’Connor, co-author of “No More Dirty Looks: The Truth About Your Beauty Products and the Ultimate Guide to Clean and Safe Cosmetics.” Fragrance ingredients can even crop up in products labeled “unscented” because companies use special fragrance chemicals known as masking agents to create that non-scent.Soothing swap: If you’re sensitive to fragrance, avoid any products that have the word “fragrance” on their ingredient label and look for “fragrance-free” alternatives.MetalsEva Plevier/StocksyIf you’re allergic to nickel (found in costume jewelry and the plating of metal buttons and snaps) or any other metals, beware of cobalt, which is used in various personal care products like antiperspirants and light brown hair dyes, says Zeichner. Other metals that can appear in cosmetics include aluminum, chromium, and lead.Soothing swap: Try a natural deodorant and do a patch test with any new mineral makeup or other cosmetic likely to contain metallic pigments, to be sure you don’t react before you put it on delicate facial skin.EmollientsGreta Marie/Getty Images“Emollients are ingredients designed to feel good on your skin,” says Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist and co-founder of BeautyBrains.com. “But many of them can cause breakouts, especially for acne-prone skin.” The list of emollients to be wary of includes lanolin, coconut butter, cocoa butter, isopropyl palmitate, isostearyl isosterate, and myristyl lactate.Soothing swap: If you’re prone to breakouts, be sure to choose a water-based, non-comodogenic moisturizer that will help your skin retain its water content without clogging pores.SulfatesRuslan Dashinsky/Getty ImagesSodium laureth sulfate and sodium laurel sulfate are detergents used in everything from shampoo and body wash to baby soap — so if you’re experiencing chronic eye and/or skin irritation, you may want to try giving these products a break. “I have known these chemicals to cause rashes, blemishes, and eye irritation,” says O’Connor. “Not to mention, they are incredibly drying to your hair and skin.”Soothing swap: Check ingredient lists to avoid these ingredients. “They’re usually right there at the top of the list,” says O’Connor. “Fortunately, most natural and organic shampoos do not contain them and are gentler on your hair to boot.”Essential OilsBernard Radvaner/CorbisWhen you start shopping for beauty products at the health food store, keep in mind that natural isn’t always better. “Essential oils are natural but they can cause irritation in some people, particularly in the form of rashes,” says O’Connor. You’ll see them added to some shampoos, conditioners, body lotions, and face creams.Soothing swap: “If you suspect that you’re reacting to an essential oil, try to isolate which one so you can look for it on ingredient lists,” suggests O’Connor. “Unlike synthetic fragrances, most companies using essential oils will list them out separately, which makes them easier to spot and avoid.”
