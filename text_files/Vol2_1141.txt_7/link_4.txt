So, in a bid to keep our limbs rash-free this summer, we enlisted the best dermatologists in the business, Dr Stefanie Williams and Dr. Justine Kluk, to fill us in on how to stop the unsightly (and oh-so-itchy) bumps from ruining your cool.Getty ImagesWhat Is Heat Rash?Before we get to the good bit, it pays to know exactly what you're treating. There's 'sweat rash' (prickly heat) and 'sun allergy' (PLE aka polymorphic light eruption), both have similar symptoms and are often confused, so here's what you need to know to be able to tell the difference. 'Prickly heat, otherwise known as Miliaria, occurs when sweat ducts get obstructed, sweat leaks then into the skin and the skin gets inflamed around that tiny leakage. A prickly rash appears with red, very itchy little bumps (papules)', explains Dr Stefanie Williams. Uh, ouch. 'The sweat ducts can be blocked by an overgrowth of bacteria which normally live on our skin, which leads to a ‘sticky’ by-product blocking up the sweat ducts and trapping sweat under the skin. Up to 30% of people may develop this under certain trigger conditions, which is naturally most common in hot, humid climates', Dr Williams  clarifies.Filippo FortisAlthough the effect they have on skin can look similar, PLE on the other hand is an allergy to the sun. 'PLE is a common form of a reaction to UV light that often occurs in young women in spring and summer. The name ‘polymorphic’ refers to the fact that the rash can appear in many different shapes or forms, although in one person it usually looks the same every time it appears', says Dr Williams . The difference? The location of the ever attractive rash. Dr Williams  explains, 'They can look quite similar, but while heat rash occurs mostly in occluded skin areas prone to sweating, PLE occurs on skin that has been exposed to the sun recently (but traditionally might be covered with clothing, so isn’t ‘used’ to the sun).' Your skin is at risk of UV exposure anywhere, and what with the sunshine being nothing short of divine recently (thank you, weather gods) it's never been more important to protect your limbs. Tristan Fewings//Getty ImagesHow To Prevent Heat RashBecause prevention is always better than cure, right?1. Choose The Right SPFThe obvious way to keep heat rash at arms length is to slather on the SPF religiously, but Dr. Justine Kluk mentions that it has to include both UVA as well as standard UVB protection to be worth your while in reducing the risks of breaking out in red bumps. 'Look for the UVA symbol or the words 'broad spectrum' on the label,' she advises.ELLE Edit: 19 Of The Best Sun Creams To Prevent SunburnLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Sun Protection SPF50+ Milk£23 at LookFantasticCredit: .Feel pleased with your sun protection plus your impact on the planet with La Roche-Posay's eco conscious tube of SPF50.Hello Sunday The Essential One - Body Cream SPF 30£16 at Cult BeautyCredit: .Wave white casts goodbye, Hello Sunday's invisible sun cream formula disappears instantly on every skin tone.

Take A Course Of Oral Steroids'For those whose holiday is ruined by prickly heat every year, taking a 5-7 day course of oral steroids starting a couple of days before you are due to travel may prevent a severe attack,' says Dr. Kluk.However, as with all medication, Dr. Kluk stresses the importance of discussing this with a Consultant Dermatologist or GP experienced in heat rash and skin conditions.3. Train Your Skin 'For PLE, prevention is an important measure. This can be attempted by slowly getting your skin used to the sun at the beginning of the sunny season or prior to a sunny holiday', explains Dr Williams. Clever.'But, of course, common sense should apply, so that the skin isn’t exposed long enough to burn', advises Dr Kluk. LAUNCHMETRICS SPOTLIGHT4. Cover Up As well as applying a sunscreen with both UVA and UVB protection, Dr. Kluk recommends investing in densely woven sun protection clothing, which can reduce the risk of heat rash even further.The 38 Best Bucket Hats To Keep The Sun Off Your Nose In 2021Leather Bucket Hat COS £89.00SHOP NOWThis bucket hat is a great way to add a pop of colour to your outfit..Prada Logo bucket hatShop at FarfetchCredit: .£380.00Prada are well known for their bucket hats. Loeffler Randall Ivy gingham shell bucket hatNow 50% Off£25 at NET-A-PORTEREnjoy a picnic in the sunshine with this cute bucket hat. Kangol Bermuda Bucket HatShop at kangol.comCredit: .£40.41Stand out of the crown in bright yellow. Wool Felt Bucket HatPrada£350.00SHOP NOWPerfect no matter what the weather. .JW Anderson Asymmetric abstract-print bucket hatShop at FarfetchCredit: .£127.00This bucket hat is a great statement piece to switch up a straight-forward ensemble.Black logo bucket hat Issey Miyake £315.00SHOP NOWGreat hat for a utility look. .Asos  Teddy Bucket Hat£15 at ASOSCredit: .Match this hat with a teddy bear jacket for the whole look.Fendi FF motif interwoven bucket hatShop at FarfetchCredit: .£690.00Pair this lovley straw bucket hat with a straw bag for the perfect beach look. & Other Stories  Felt Wool Blend Bucket Hat£29 at StoriesCredit: .Feeling nostalgic?

Avoid Sweating As Much As Possible We're not talking about applying layers and layers of deodorant. Sounds almost impossible but staying cool is the aim of the game.'Prevention of sweat/heat rash includes avoiding sweating as much as possible. Even for only a few hours per day (e.g. an air-conditioned office) is helpful. Also, a cool shower during a hot day might help.'Avoid over-dressing, occlusive clothes and friction/rubbing from clothes. Furthermore, you should avoid any irritation of the skin (e.g. excessive soap etc.) and avoid using rich, greasy moisturisers and heavy sunscreens', advises Dr Williams. 20 Of The Best Natural Deodorants For That Fresh Feeling Minus The SyntheticsBest detoxifying natural deodorantGOBO Natural Aluminium Free AHA Deodorant £10 at AmazonCredit: .

Take A Daily Antihistamine That's right, those little white tablets aren't just good for alleviating the symptoms of hay fever. 'Taken daily, an antihistamine may help to reduce the itch associated with the rash,' she advises.Cetirizine, loratadine and fexofenadine are less likely to make you feel drowsy, but remember to take them as your GP, a pharmacist or the leaflet describes. Unknown2. Swap Out Your Shower GelWhile there's nothing more luxe than a beautifully scented shower gel that lathers up a dream, you might want to swap it out for something kinder if you're battling heat rash. Dr. Kluk recommends a gentle, emollient-based body wash as not to irritate the skin further. 20 Of The Best Shower Gels And Body WashesChanel N°5 The Shower Gel£45 at BootsCredit: .Yes it's Chanel, so it's instantly covetable.

Apply A Steroid Cream'For very itchy, raised, red or swollen areas, a steroid cream may be prescribed to relieve discomfort until the rash has settled', says Dr. Kluk. According to the NHS, topical steroids also come in the form of lotions, gels, mousses and ointments and are available in a variety of different potencies depending on the condition of your skin. Hyrdocortisone and Eumovate can be bought over the counter, but stronger topical steroids are only available on prescription from a GP or dermatologist. Rosdiana Ciaravolo //Getty Images4. Switch Up Your Body LotionThat piña colada-scented body lotion may be a brilliant addition to your summer bodycare routine, but it might not be doing your heat rash any good. 'Avoid putting anything on the skin that may irritate it further, such as perfume or heavily fragranced skincare products,' adds Dr. Kluk. 'Instead, apply a soothing moisturiser containing menthol or aloe vera to calm the skin,' she adds. 'To cool the skin down even more so, pop it in the fridge for half an hour beforehand.'It's important not to lather on the thickest creams in your skincare arsenal either. 'Avoid heavy, greasy moisturisers, but stick to lightweight emollients or aloe vera lotion/gel. Anti-itch emollients such as Dermol lotion may also be useful to ease the itchiness', explains Dr Williams.

Stay In The ShadeOk, this one's obvious, but when the lure of lying flat out on the grass with a tin of Gordon's Gin & Tonic in hand gets too much, remember, it'll only exacerbate your heat rash - not good. 'Seek the shade or stay out of the sun wherever possible for a few days to allow heat rash to settle,' says Dr. Kluk.16 Of The Best Face SPFs For Acne-Prone SkinOpen GalleryRelated StoriesJust A Super Useful Guide To Treating Sunburn7 Dermatologist-Approved Acne TreatmentsWatch Next play iconThe triangle icon that indicates to playSkinSuki Waterhouse On Skin Icing And Self-CareELLE Edit: Best Face Masks For AcneELLE Edit: 25 Of The Best Face TonersELLE Edit: 15 Of The Best Hyaluronic Acid SerumsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowSo, Does The Solawave Live Up To The Hype?From ELLE for myBlendHow To Personalise Your SkincareThe £22 Body Oil Cindy Crawford Won’t Ever Give Up ASMR Is Here To Soothe Your Mind And Your SkinLa Mer Taps Michelle Yeoh For Their New CampaignELLE Edit: 15 Of The Best Primers For Dry Skin Is The Future Of Dermatology Digital?ELLE Lab: Best Vitamin C SerumsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowLondon Fashion WeekParis Fashion WeekMilan Fashion WeekNew York Fashion WeekNewsFashionWedding IdeasBeautyHair TrendsLife + cultureHoliday InspirationAll videosElle fashion cupboardELLE, PART OF THE HEARST UK FASHION & BEAUTY NETWORKWe earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article.©Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.
