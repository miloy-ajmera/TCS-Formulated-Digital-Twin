                #1 Best product for professional massage therapists
            


                
                    
                        Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2022
                    
                    
                
            


            I've been a practicing massage therapist for over 25 years, professional licensed massage therapist since 2002 in NC. Whatever modality you use, deep tissue, lymphatic drainage, pregnancy massage, Myofascial Release, THIS IS the product you need! I've used others... and they Never had the glide, moisturizing, texture I need. A professional Athlete doesn't have time to feel slimy with other lotions. BIOTONE is the Only product I use in my practice, on my family, or if I need to flush my own arms and legs after a workout. Best $$$ I've ever spent for my business. Thank you

Long lasting
Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2023Size: 128 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I love this cream as a massage therapist. Is spreads very well without drying out super fast. It does not leave your skin oily so the client is pleased and their really isn't a scent other than lotion smell and it's pleasant.

BEST MASSAGE CREAM!
Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023Size: 128 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I love this cream!!!! Biotone is simply the best. Quality ingredients, perfect glide, smells great (light, fresh scent), and a little goes a long way. I used to buy cream half the price but I'm so happy I started investing in Biotone because it's so worth the extra money.

Great for mixing
Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2023Size: 128 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
We use this, in our practice, to mix in with a lotion. The lotion gives the quantity, but this blended in gives just the right glide needed for cupping & to use smaller amounts, than when using lotion alone. I like that it doesn't have a scent & we don't have any issues getting lotion out of our linens.

This is a longer lasting moisturizer than most & not greasy. I had an exceptionally dry area on my face & it’s the only product that helped.  Will order it again

Too choice
Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023Size: 128 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
I always buy this specific cream because you can use it for every therapy outside of hot or cold stones.It is a bit pricey, however.

Biotone Dual Purpose Massage Cream
Reviewed in Mexico on January 4, 2020Size: 128 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)Verified Purchase
Cumple con el propósito de uso, se desliza como el aceite vehicular con la diferencia de que se absorbe completamente en tanto se termina el masaje,  no queda la sensación grasosa, aunque deja visiblemente humectada la piel, no mancha las sábanas que eso es genial para masajistas y se combina muy bien con aceites esenciales para el masaje
