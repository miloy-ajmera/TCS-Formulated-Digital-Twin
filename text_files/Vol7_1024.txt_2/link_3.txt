Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride is an ingredient used in soaps and cosmetics. It's usually made from combining coconut oil with glycerin.This ingredient is sometimes called capric triglyceride.It has been widely used for more than 50 years. It helps smooth skin and works as an antioxidant. It also binds other ingredients together, and can work as a preservative of sorts to make the active ingredients in cosmetics last longer.Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride is valued as a more natural alternative to other synthetic chemicals found in topical skin products. Companies that claim that their products are “all natural” or “organic” often contain caprylic triglyceride. While it's technically made of natural components, the caprylic triglyceride used in products isn't usually found in nature. A chemical process separates the oily liquid so that a “pure” version of it can be added to products.Caprylic/capric triglyceride benefitsCaprylic triglycerides are compounds made of naturally occurring fatty acids. They’re a clear liquid and slightly sweet to the taste. The high fat content in triglycerides, along with their texture and antioxidant qualities, make them of particular use for soap and skin care products.EmollientEmollients are ingredients that soften your skin. Emollients work by trapping moisture in your skin and forming a protective layer so the moisture can't escape. Caprylic triglyceride is an effective skin-softening ingredient.Dispersing agentDispersing agents are the parts of any chemical or organic compound that hold the ingredients together and stabilize them.Mixing other active ingredients, pigments, or scents in a good dispersing agent keeps the ingredients from clumping together or sinking to the bottom of the mixture. The waxy and thick consistency of caprylic triglycerides make them an excellent dispersing agent.SolventSolvents are ingredients that can dissolve, or break apart, certain ingredients or compounds. Ingredients are solvents based on how their molecules are structured and shaped, and how they interact with other substances.Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride can dissolve compounds that are designed to clump together. While some solvents have toxic ingredients, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride doesn't carry those risks.AntioxidantAntioxidants work to neutralize toxins you're exposed to every day in your environment. Antioxidants stop the chain reaction called oxidation, which can age your skin and take a toll on your body.Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride is full of antioxidants that help preserve your skin and help you feel younger.Caprylic/capric triglyceride usesCaprylic triglyceride can be found in topical skin care products that you use on and around your face. It's used to:boost the shelf life of these productsadd a sheen to your skin that’s light and non-greasyboost the antioxidants in the productCaprylic/capric triglyceride in cosmeticsCaprylic triglyceride is a popular ingredient in makeup and other cosmetics. The ingredient keeps pigments evenly distributed in a cosmetic formula without causing a sticky feeling on your skin. You’ll often see this ingredient listed in these cosmetics: lipstick, lip balm, lip liner, cream-based and liquid foundations, eye liner.Felicia, FandaChem  WhatsApp: 008619967429831
