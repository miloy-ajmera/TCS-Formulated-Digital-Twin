Star0IdentificationSummaryMedium-chain triglycerides is a source of essential fatty acids used as a source of calories in parenteral nutrition.Generic NameMedium-chain triglyceridesDrugBank Accession NumberDB13959BackgroundMedium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are triglycerides made up of a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids with an aliphatic tail of six to 12 carbon atoms. MCTs are found in natural foods, such as coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and raw coconut meat. In the body, MCTs are broken down into glycerol and free fatty acids, which are directly absorbed into the blood stream and transported to the target organs to exert a range of biological and metabolic effects.4 MCTs are used in parenteral nutrition therapy: they serve as a source of calories and essential fatty acids in conditions associated with malnutrition and malabsorption.10

MIGLYOL 810 N
MIGLYOL 812 NPharmacologyIndicationMedium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), in combination with other compounds like fish oils, soya oil, and olive oil, is indicated in adult and pediatric patients, including term and preterm neonates, as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated.10 MCTs are also available as over-the-counter natural products and health supplements.

It is proposed that MCTs induces weight loss through increasing energy expenditure and fat oxidation, and altering body composition.4 However, it is unknown whether the effects of MCTs on energy expenditure and body weight are long-lasting and sustainable.9 MCTs can also play a role in food intake and satiety, as some studies showed that MCT consumption led to reduced food intake.4,6,7 While MCTs was shown to reduce energy intake, it was not shown to affect appetite.8 MCT may facilitate the absorption of calcium.2
Mechanism of actionMedium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are broken down into glycerol and medium-chain fatty acids, which are directly absorbed into the blood stream and transported to the target organs,4 where they undergo β-oxidation to form acetyl-CoA. The β-oxidation is the most common mechanism of action for energy production derived from fatty acid metabolism.10 Because medium-chain fatty acids are rapidly oxidized, it leads to greater energy expenditure.9 Fatty acids are important substrates for energy production and also play a critical role in membrane structure and function. Additionally, fatty acids act as precursors for bioactive molecules (such as prostaglandins) and as regulators of gene expression.10
Fatty acids may mediate their effects on energy expenditure, food consumption, and fat deposition by upregulating the expression and protein levels of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism via activating Akt and AMPK signaling pathways and inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway. It is proposed that the promotion of weight loss by MCTs may be due to sympathetic activation of brown fat thermogenesis.4
AbsorptionMedium chain triglycerides are rapidly absorbed.2,11 They passively and directly diffuse across the gastrointestinal tract into the portal system then to liver, where they are oxidized.9,11
Volume of distributionThe apparent volumes of distribution have been researched as approximately 4.5 L for medium chain triglycerides and 19 L for medium chain fatty acids in a typical 70-kg subject.1
Protein bindingMedium chain triglycerides bind weakly to serum albumin. They can readily cross the blood-brain barrier.11
MetabolismMedium chain triglycerides are hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase to glycerol and medium-chain free fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid.4,10,11 Free fatty acids then undergo β-oxidation in the organs such as the liver, kidneys, and heart. Alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid are metabolized within a common biochemical pathway through a series of desaturation and elongation steps. Downstream products of alpha-linolenic acid are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and linoleic acid is converted to arachidonic acid.10

Arachidonic AcidRoute of eliminationThere is limited information available regarding the main route of elimination. 
Half-lifeThe plasma half-life of medium chain triglycerides is recorded to be 11 minutes and that of medium chain fatty acids is about 17 minutes.1
ClearanceThe clearance of medium chain triglycerides in healthy control subjects was measured to be about 1.93 +/- 0.34 mL.kg-1.min-1.3

Fat overload syndrome is a condition rarely reported with the use of intravenous lipid emulsions that is most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dose or infusion rate was exceeded. However, some cases still occurred when the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions. Fat overload syndrome results from a reduced or limited ability to metabolize lipids, accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance, leading to a sudden deterioration in the patient's condition.10
If signs or symptoms of fat overload syndrome occur, stop the infusion of medium chain triglyceride-containing emulsions until triglyceride levels have normalized and symptoms have abated. The effects are usually reversible by stopping the lipid infusion. If medically appropriate, further intervention may be indicated. Lipids are not dialyzable from plasma.10
