imuno® - GcMAF made better
imuno® - The Cream contains all the benefits of imuno®- The Solution.
imuno® - The Cream's active ingredients are nanosized for deep delivery through the skin.
imuno® is produced under licence in a pharmaceutical facility which is audited by Medsafe, a division of the Ministry of Health of New Zealand, to both GMP and Pharmacy Standards NZ.
Instructions

For external use only. Store in a cool, dry place (Refrigerate for long term storage). Keep out of direct sunlight.
Use the supplied spatula (or your finger) to remove some imuno® Cream from the jar.
Use roughly 1 or 2 pea sized pieces of imuno cream in each area of concern, once or twice a day.
Apply to skin, where required, and massage with finger until absorbed.
Each 50ml jar of imuno® Cream contains approximately 186 pea sized (8mm dia) pieces or six months supply at 1 pea a day.

To support lymphatic flow from the brain: Apply some imuno cream to both sides of the neck and gently massage until absorbed. Massage from top (the angle of the mandible) to bottom, to stimulate the lymphatic circulation in that direction.
To support lymphatic flow in the upper body: Apply some imuno cream to the axillary area and massage up the arm and away from the breast towards the armpit.
To support lymphatic flow in the lower body: Apply some imuno cream to the inguinal area and massage up the legs and down the abdomen towards the groin.
Superior Immune Support: Apply some imuno anywhere, or to the area over the spleen and massage until absorbed. The spleen is located on the left side of the body under the 9th to 11th rib.
Superior Mitochondrial Support: Apply some imuno anywhere, or to the area over the liver and massage until absorbed. The liver is located on the right side of the body under the 6th to 11th rib.

some ingredients not good
I just started using. I don't like that it contains corn and sugar - both should not be consumed by anyone with mold toxicity.  I also don't like the preservatives. I formerly used Sophia flow cream which is a better formula but I can't find it anymore.  I hope this review will be read by and the formula changed.

Thank you for your product review on our website. We always welcome feedback, whether it is positive or negative. However, in this particular case, we feel that this review was unfair and would like to have a chance to invite you to change your mind. Here is why:  imuno cream does NOT contain sugar or corn. It contains Propanediol which is made by fermenting corn sugar. After the fermentation process is completed, the microbes have completely digested the corn sugar and excreted a natural compound named Propanediol which is NOTHING like the corn sugar. The corn sugar was simply food for the microbes. A further point is that Sophia Flow DOES contain sugar. Potassium sorbate is widely used as a preservative in foods, drinks, and personal care products.
