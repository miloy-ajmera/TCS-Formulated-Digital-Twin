The beauty solution for a long night with little sleep


moisturizes.firms.nourishes dry skin.

Eyes look rested and more beautiful with this luxurious eye cream containing soothing herbs and active plant cells. Antioxidant-rich green tea and goji berries reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, while cucumber extract and the herb eyebright temporarily ease puffiness.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Anti-Aging Eye Cream
"What I love most about this cream is that it goes on light, feels creamy but not overpowering or too thick. It is just the right consistency to moisturize under my eyes but not cause additional puffiness that other, thicker formulas tend to do. I love the feel of it on my skin, and believe it helps to relieve dryness under my eyes. 5 stars!!!"

CoQ10
Also known as ubiquinone, this is an enzyme naturally produced in the body—and it decreases with age. Topically, CoQ10 is a stimulating nutrient that provides protection from environmental stressors as it restores a youthful complexion.


cucumber extract
This uniquely cooling, silica-rich distillate soothes and tames sensitivities, while quenching dry and parched skin.


damas rose plant cells
This quintessential component of our Anti-Aging Eye Cream has been clinically proven to decrease the appearance of crow’s feet and other signs of wear.


sweet iris plant cells
Targeted to help firm and tighten the appearance of delicate skin around the eyes.

Story
Your smile lights up a room. A sun room, in fact. And your no-filter selfie is enough to stop your lover in their tracks. A dear in headlights, if you will.
It took some trial and (and toxic) error, perhaps. Remember that self-proclaimed plumping cream, which promised to de-puff and renew via petroleum-derived emollients? How about the anti-wrinkle elixir, which claimed (in so many words) to defy gravity? The first couldn’t play nice with your makeup or your sunscreen, to say nothing of the breakouts. And the second—despite its stance against greenwashing—simply caked your face in red-velvet splotches. Thanks, but…
Now you know that a natural solution is paramount. So when we say the Anti-Aging Eye Cream is a dose of wearable photosynthesis, it’s just our way of targeting certain signs of aging with powerful plants—a million living plant cells included—that can revive the most delicate area of our complexion.
When it comes to soothing sensitivities, we’ve enlisted chamomile, comfrey, lavender and sea buckthorn. When it comes to dryness and the look of wrinkles, we’ve called upon mango seed butter, jojoba oil, milk thistle and green tea. As for the appearance of dark circles? There is licorice root, butcher’s broom and cucumber distillate.
There are aromatherapeutic bonuses to all this freshness, especially upon first (and repeated) application. You could even try storing the Anti-Aging Eye Cream in your fridge, somewhere between the brassicas and a row of kombucha elixirs. Why not apply a cool dose of this peptide-steeped potion in the evening, just before catching zzz’s? Let it soak overnight and wake up aglow, as if you just caught up on a decade’s worth of sleep. Take a second to admire your ageless gaze and enjoy a color breakfast on the veranda. Now that’s a restful slumber.

Love this product!



I was looking for a new eye cream, and I couldn't be more happy with this one.  It is light and moisturizing.  The skin around my eyes has never looked better.  I use it morning and night.  It takes only the tiniest drop to use it.  One thing I really like about it is that after using it in the morning my eye primer and eyeshadows work perfectly over the top of the cream.  This product is a winner!

Good product - would recommend



Although I have not noticed any extraordinary results, I do like this eye cream.  It is moisturizing and works well under make up.  It will last a long time because you only need a small amount. Even a full pump is too much.

Anti-Aging Eye Cream = Nourishment



I love this eye cream because I’ve always had dry skin and this helps protect it.  I use it day and night.  Even if I want to use another eye cream in the day that is illuminating, I still use this first.  I think it is for all skin types, it is excellent for dry skin.  I also love the Anti-Aging Facial Oil and it’s my everyday go to as well.  Sometimes I put a drop of this into my tinted sunscreen too because my skin is dry.
