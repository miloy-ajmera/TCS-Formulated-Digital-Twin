Description


Additional information


Reviews




Perfecta Exclusive Anti-Wrinkle Cream for day and night is recommended for the daily care of mature skin in need of an anti-wrinkle therapy.
The formula, based on 24-carat colloidal gold, phenomenally irons out the skin and fills in even very deeply seated wrinkles, markedly reducing their length, width, and depth. A luxurious blend of white truffles and PepLIFT 4D restores the optimum density of collagen in the skin, powerfully regenerates, and lifts. The extract of satsuma orange lightens all spots and discolourations apparent on the skin and evens out the skin tone. A unique combination of hyaluronic acid and vitamin C has superb moisturising properties and rejuvenates the appearance of the skin. Ceramides rebuild the epidermal lipid barrier, intensively nourish, regenerate, and moisturise the skin, which is protected against photoageing by UVA/UVB filters.
