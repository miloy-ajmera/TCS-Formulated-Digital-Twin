                            Enameguard™ is a naturally-derived hydrolyzed wheat protein that supports and restores natural mineral balance in the oral environment. Acid challenges by daily consumption of acid food/beverage disrupt the buffering capability and mineral balance of saliva which ultimately leads to enamel softening/erosion. Enameguard™ helps aid in natural remineralization by supporting the buffering effects of saliva. It binds to enamel surface and interacts with the surrounding calcium and phosphate ions from saliva. view less

                            Eumulgin® B 25 NA is a cosmetic grade oil-in-water emulsifier, which is used for the production of ointments, creams, liquid emulsions, gels and other cosmetic formulations. Supplied in the form of free-flowing, non-dusting micro-granules that dissolve in water and alcohol to form either a colloid or a clear solution. Eumulgin® B 25 NA is soluble in vegetable and mineral fats and oils. The warm emulsifiers can be mixed with mineral, vegetable, and synthetic fats and oils, as well as with fatty alcohols, fatty acids, mono- and di-stearates, and with polyethylene glycols. Creams and lotions can be formulated easily. 
If Eumulgin® B 25 NA is used together with cetyl or stearyl alcohol or both, homogeneous ointment and cream bases are obtained that can absorb as much as 90% water. Eumulgin® B 25 NA is a very efficient protective colloid and can increase the stability of dispersed systems. In concentrations of 21 – 30%, Eumulgin® B 25 NA forms gel-like, brushable hydrates with water. The consistency of these gels can be adjusted from solid to liquid by adding small amounts of Luviskol® K 17. view less

                            Euperlan® PK 810 US is a pearl concentrate used in the manufacture of cosmetic preparations based on anionic surfactants. The low viscosity of this product facilitates processing when incorporated at cold temperatures and enables delivery in road tanks due to its pumpability. Euperlan® PK 810 US contains conditioning substances which promote super-fatting which is particularly desirable in bath and shower preparations. It can be used as a bath opacifying pearlescent agent for shampoos, foam baths, washing lotions, and other surfactant preparations. Euperlan® PK 810 US is miscible with all anionic surfactants and most other detergent raw materials. Due to its low viscosity, this product proves suitable in continuous cold production procedures. view less

                            Hyalurosmooth™ PW LS 8997 is a natural, botanically derived high molecular weight polysaccharide from the seeds of the Indian plant Cassia angustifolia. The polysaccharides form a protective film on the skin that strongly binds water and fills up fine lines. By providing intense moisturization the skin is additionally plumped up, which further adds to reducing fine lines and wrinkles and smoothing of the skin surface. As a result of the smoother surface, light reflection is also improved, leading to increased skin radiance. view less
