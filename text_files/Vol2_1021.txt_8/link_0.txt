Description
Luviquat FC 550 is a quaternized copolymer for hair and skin care. It is an aqueous solution of cationic polymers of different charge density and different degrees of setting and conditioning. This product is a clear to slightly turbid yellowish viscous liquid, with a slight characteristic odor. Luviquat FC 550 has a weight composition of 50% VP, a solids content of 38-42, and a charge density of 3.3 meq/g at pH 7. This product is ideally used in mouse, spray, hair and skin conditioner and shampoo, body lotion, and shaving preparations.
