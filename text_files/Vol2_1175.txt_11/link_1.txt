Synonyms include caustic soda, lye, soda 
                    lye, and sodium hydrate.

Persons whose clothing or skin is contaminated with solid 
                      sodium hydroxide or its solutions can secondarily contaminate 
                      rescuers by direct contact.
Sodium hydroxide is a white, noncombustible solid that 
                      absorbs moisture from the air. When the solid is in contact 
                      with water, it may generate sufficient heat to ignite combustible 
                      materials. The solid and its solutions are corrosive. Sodium 
                      hydroxide is odorless; thus, odor provides no warning of 
                      hazardous concentrations.
Sodium hydroxide does not produce systemic toxicity, but 
                      is very CORROSIVE and can cause severe burns in all tissues 
                      that it comes in contact with. Sodium hydroxide poses a 
                      particular threat to the eyes, since it can hydrolyze protein, 
                      leading to severe eye damage.

 General Information
Description
At room temperature, anhydrous sodium 
                    hydroxide is a white crystalline, odorless solid that absorbs 
                    moisture from the air. It is produced as flakes, pellets, 
                    sticks, and cakes. When dissolved in water or neutralized 
                    with acid, it liberates substantial heat, which may be sufficient 
                    to ignite combustible materials. Sodium hydroxide is caustic 
                    and is one of several alkaline compounds referred to as "lye." 
                    It is generally used commercially as either the solid or as 
                    a 50% aqueous solution and should be stored in a cool, dry, 
                    well ventilated location separate from organic and oxidizing 
                    materials, acids, and metal powders.
Routes of Exposure
Inhalation
Inhalation of sodium hydroxide dust, 
                    mist, or aerosol may cause irritation of the mucous membranes 
                    of the nose, throat, and respiratory tract. Sodium hydroxide 
                    is odorless; thus, odor provides no warning of hazardous 
                    concentrations. Mucous membrane irritation occurs at the 
                    OSHA PEL (2 mg/m3) and is generally an adequate warning 
                    property for acute exposure to sodium hydroxide. However, 
                    workers exposed to prolonged or recurrent mists or aerosols 
                    of sodium hydroxide can become somewhat tolerant of the irritant 
                    effects. Sodium hydroxide of sufficient strength can hydrolyze 
                    proteins in tissues and can kill cells in tissues.
Children exposed to the same levels of 
                    sodium hydroxide in air as adults may receive a larger dose 
                    because they have greater lung surface area:body weight ratios 
                    and increased minute volumes:weight ratios. In addition, they 
                    may be exposed to higher levels than adults in the same location 
                    because of their short stature and the higher levels of sodium 
                    hydroxide in air found nearer to the ground. 
Skin/Eye Contact
Exposure to sodium hydroxide solid or 
                    solution can cause skin and eye irritation. Direct contact 
                    with the solid or with concentrated solutions causes thermal 
                    and chemical burns leading to deep-tissue injuries. Very strong 
                    solutions of sodium hydroxide can hydrolyze proteins in the 
                    eyes, leading to severe burns and eye damage or, in extreme 
                    cases, blindness.
Children are more vulnerable to toxicants 
                    affecting the skin because of their relatively larger surface 
                    area: body weight ratio.
Ingestion
Ingestion of sodium hydroxide can cause 
                    severe corrosive injury to the lips, tongue, oral mucosa, 
                    esophagus, and stomach.
Sources/Uses
Sodium hydroxide is produced by the electrolysis 
                    of aqueous solutions of sodium chloride (brine) or by reacting 
                    naturally occurring sodium carbonate with calcium hydroxide.
Sodium hydroxide is used to manufacture 
                    soaps, rayon, paper, explosives, dyestuffs, and petroleum 
                    products. It is also used in processing cotton fabric, laundering 
                    and bleaching, metal cleaning and processing, electroplating, 
                    oxide coating, and electrolytic extracting. It is commonly 
                    present in commercial drain and oven cleaners.
Standards and Guidelines
OSHA PEL (permissible exposure limit) 
                    = 2 mg/m3 (averaged over an 8-hour workshift)
NIOSH IDLH (immediately dangerous to 
                    life or health) = 10 mg/m3
AIHA ERPG-2 (emergency response planning 
                    guideline) (maximum airborne concentration below which it 
                    is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for 
                    up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible 
                    or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair 
                    an individual's ability to take protective action) = 5 mg/m3

                    to ignite combustible materials.
Incompatibilities
Sodium hydroxide dissolves easily in 
                    water generating a great deal of heat. It reacts with acids 
                    (also generating a lot of heat); halogenated organic compounds; 
                    metals such as aluminum, tin, and zinc; and nitromethane. 
                    Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to most metals.

Health Effects

Sodium hydroxide is strongly irritating and corrosive. 
                      It can cause severe burns and permanent damage to any tissue 
                      that it comes in contact with. Sodium hydroxide can cause 
                      hydrolysis of proteins, and hence can cause burns in the 
                      eyes which may lead to permanent eye damage.
Inhaled sodium hydroxide can cause swelling of the larynx 
                      and an accumulation of fluid in the lungs.
Stridor, vomiting, drooling, and abdominal pain are early 
                      symptoms of sodium hydroxide ingestion. Ingestion may lead 
                      to perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and shock.
Sodium hydroxide does not produce systemic toxicity; its 
                      health effects are due to its corrosive nature.

Acute Exposure
Sodium hydroxide is strongly irritating 
                    and corrosive. It can cause severe burns and permanent damage 
                    to any tissue that it comes in contact with. The extent of 
                    damage to the gastrointestinal tract may not be clear until 
                    several hours after ingestion. Inhaled sodium hydroxide can 
                    cause swelling of the larynx and an accumulation of fluid 
                    in the lungs. Contact with 25-50% solutions produces immediate 
                    irritation, while after contact with solutions of 4% or less, 
                    irritation may not develop for several hours. It may not be 
                    possible to correctly ascertain the degree of damage to eyes 
                    for up to 72 hours after exposure.
Children do not always respond to chemicals 
                    in the same way that adults do. Different protocols for managing 
                    their care may be needed.
Respiratory
Inhalation of sodium hydroxide is immediately 
                    irritating to the respiratory tract. Swelling or spasms of 
                    the larynx leading to upper-airway obstruction and asphyxia 
                    can occur after high-dose inhalation. Inflammation of the 
                    lungs and an accumulation of fluid in the lungs may also occur.
Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive 
                    agents than adults because of the relatively smaller diameter 
                    of their airways.
Children may be more vulnerable because 
                    of relatively increased minute ventilation per kg and failure 
                    to evacuate an area promptly when exposed.
People with asthma or emphysema may be 
                    more susceptible to the toxicity of this agent.
Dermal 
Skin contact with solid sodium hydroxide or its concentrated solutions can cause severe burns with deep ulcerations. Burns appear soft and moist and are very painful. Although contact with concentrated solutions causes pain and irritation within 3 minutes, contact with dilute solutions may not cause symptoms for several hours.  
Because of their relatively larger surface area:body weight ratio, children are more vulnerable to toxicants affecting the skin. 
Ocular
Eye exposure may produce diffuse or localized 
                    blood vessel clots and an accumulation of fluid in the eye. 
                    Softening, sloughing, and ulcerations of the cornea may occur. 
                    Ulcerations may continue to progress for many days. Severe 
                    injury can lead to clouding of the eye surface and blindness.
Gastrointestinal
Ingestion of sodium hydroxide can cause 
                    spontaneous vomiting, chest and abdominal pain, and difficulty 
                    swallowing with drooling. Corrosive injury to the mouth, throat, 
                    esophagus, and stomach is extremely rapid and may result in 
                    perforation, hemorrhage, and narrowing of the gastrointestinal 
                    tract.
Potential Sequelae
Cataracts, glaucoma, adhesion of the 
                    eyelid to the cornea, blindness, and loss of the eye may occur 
                    after eye exposure. 
Cancer of the esophagus has been reported 
                    15 to 40 years after the formation of corrosion-induced strictures. 
                    However, it is believed that these cancers were the result 
                    of tissue destruction and scar formation rather than a direct 
                    cancer-causing action of sodium hydroxide.
Severe inhalation injuries may cause 
                    persistent hoarseness and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome 
                    (RADS), a chemically- or irritant-induced type of asthma. 
                  
Chronic Exposure
Chronic exposure to dusts or mists of 
                    sodium hydroxide may lead to ulceration of the nasal passages. 
                    Chronic skin exposures can lead to dermatitis. Ingestion may 
                    lead to perforation of the gastrointestinal tract or stricture 
                    formation.
Chronic exposure may be more serious 
                    for children because of their potential longer latency period.
Carcinogenicity
Sodium hydroxide has not been classified 
                    for carcinogenic effects. See Potential Sequelae above.
Reproductive and Developmental Effects
Sodium hydroxide dissociates within the 
                    body and would not reach the reproductive organs in an unchanged 
                    state. No data were located concerning reproductive endpoints 
                    in humans exposed to sodium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is 
                    not teratogenic in rats. Sodium hydroxide is not included 
                    in Reproductive and Developmental Toxicants, a 1991 
                    report published by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) 
                    that lists 30 chemicals of concern because of widely acknowledged 
                    reproductive and developmental consequences.

 Prehospital Management

Victims whose clothing or skin is contaminated with sodium 
                      hydroxide solid or solutions can secondarily contaminate 
                      response personnel by direct contact. Victims do not pose 
                      risks of secondary contamination after clothing is removed 
                      and the skin is washed.
Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to tissues. When mists or 
                      aerosols of sodium hydroxide are inhaled, laryngeal edema 
                      and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can result. Extensive 
                      skin burns or gastrointestinal-tract injury from ingestion 
                      may compromise fluid balance, causing shock; early clinical 
                      appearance may not predict this event. Stridor, vomiting, 
                      painful swallowing, drooling, and abdominal pain are early 
                      symptoms of sodium hydroxide ingestion.
There is no antidote for sodium hydroxide. Treatment consists 
                      of respiratory and cardiovascular support.

Hot Zone
Rescuers should be trained and appropriately 
                    attired before entering the Hot Zone. If the proper equipment 
                    is not available, or if rescuers have not been trained in 
                    its use, assistance should be obtained from a local or regional 
                    HAZMAT team or other properly equipped response organization.
Rescuer Protection
Sodium hydroxide is a severe respiratory-tract 
                    and skin irritant.
Respiratory Protection: Positive-pressure, 
                    self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is recommended in 
                    response situations that involve exposure to potentially unsafe 
                    levels of sodium hydroxide.
Skin Protection: Chemical-protective 
                    clothing is recommended because sodium hydroxide can cause 
                    irritation or skin burns.
ABC Reminders
Quickly access for a patent airway, ensure 
                    adequate respiration and pulse. If trauma is suspected, maintain 
                    cervical immobilization manually and apply a cervical collar 
                    and a backboard when feasible.
Victim Removal
If victims can walk, lead them out of 
                    the Hot Zone to the Decontamination Zone. Victims who are 
                    unable to walk may be removed on backboards or gurneys; if 
                    these are not available, carefully carry or drag victims to 
                    safety.
Consider appropriate management of chemically 
                    contaminated children, such as measures to reduce separation 
                    anxiety if a child is separated from a parent or other adult.
Decontamination Zone
All victims require decontamination as 
                    described below.
Rescuer Protection
If exposure levels are determined to 
                    be safe, decontamination may be conducted by personnel wearing 
                    a lower level of protection than that worn in the Hot Zone 
                    (described above).
ABC Reminders
Quickly access for a patent airway, ensure 
                    adequate respiration and pulse. Stabilize the cervical spine 
                    with a collar and a backboard if trauma is suspected. Administer 
                    supplemental oxygen as required. Assist ventilation with a 
                    bag-valve-mask device if necessary.
Basic Decontamination
Rapid decontamination is critical. 
                    Victims who are able may assist with their own decontamination. 
                    Rescuers should wear protective clothing and gloves while 
                    treating patients whose skin is contaminated with sodium hydroxide. 
                  
Immediately brush any solid material 
                    from clothes, skin, or hair while protecting the victim's 
                    eyes. Quickly remove contaminated clothing and flush exposed 
                    areas with water for at least 15 minutes. Double-bag contaminated 
                    clothing and personal belongings. Use caution to avoid hypothermia 
                    when decontaminating children or the elderly. Use blankets 
                    or warmers when appropriate.
Flush exposed or irritated eyes with 
                    plain water or saline for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact 
                    lenses if easily removable without additional trauma to the 
                    eye, otherwise sodium hydroxide trapped beneath the lens will 
                    continue to damage the eye. If pain or injury is evident, 
                    continue irrigation while transferring the victim to the Support 
                    Zone.
In cases of ingestion, do not induce 
                    emesis. Do not administer activated charcoal or attempt 
                    to neutralize stomach contents.
Victims who are conscious and able to 
                    swallow can be given 4 to 8 ounces of milk or water; if the 
                    patient is symptomatic, delay decontamination until other 
                    emergency measures have been instituted.
                    Consider appropriate management of chemically contaminated 
                    children at the exposure site. Provide reassurance to the 
                    child during decontamination, especially if separation from 
                    a parent occurs.
Transfer to Support Zone
As soon as basic decontamination is complete, 
                    move the victim to the Support Zone.
Support Zone
Be certain that victims have been decontaminated 
                    properly (see Decontamination Zone above). Victims 
                    who have undergone decontamination pose no serious risks of 
                    secondary contamination to rescuers. In such cases, Support 
                    Zone personnel require no specialized protective gear.
ABC Reminders
Quickly access for a patent airway. If 
                    trauma is suspected, maintain cervical immobilization manually 
                    and apply a cervical collar and a backboard when feasible. 
                    Ensure adequate respiration and pulse. Administer supplemental 
                    oxygen as required and establish intravenous access if necessary. 
                    Place on a cardiac monitor.
Additional Decontamination
Continue irrigating exposed skin and 
                    eyes, as appropriate.
In cases of ingestion, do not induce 
                    emesis. Do not administer activated charcoal or attempt 
                    to neutralize stomach contents.
Victims who are conscious and able to 
                    swallow can be given 4 to 8 ounces of milk or water if this 
                    has not been given previously; if the patient is symptomatic, 
                    delay decontamination until other emergency measures have 
                    been instituted.
Advanced Treatment
In cases of respiratory compromise secure 
                    airway and respiration via endotracheal intubation. If not 
                    possible, perform cricothyroidotomy if equipped and trained 
                    to do so. Avoid blind nasotracheal intubation or the use of 
                    an esophageal obturator. Use direct visualization to intubate.
Treat patients who have bronchospasm 
                    with aerosolized bronchodilators. The use of bronchial sensitizing 
                    agents in situations of multiple chemical exposures may pose 
                    additional risks. Consider the health of the myocardium before 
                    choosing which type of bronchodilator should be administered. 
                    Cardiac sensitizing agents may be appropriate; however, the 
                    use of cardiac sensitizing agents after exposure to certain 
                    chemicals may pose enhanced risk of cardiac arrhythmias (especially 
                    in the elderly). Sodium hydroxide poisoning is not known to 
                    pose additional risk during the use of bronchial or cardiac 
                    sensitizing agents. 
Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed, cautioning for myocardial variability.
Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or are having seizures or cardiac arrhythmias should be treated 
                    according to advanced life support (ALS) protocols.
Transport to Medical Facility
Only decontaminated patients should be 
                    transported to a medical facility. "Body bags" are 
                    not recommended.
Report to the base station and the receiving 
                    medical facility the condition of the patient, treatment given, 
                    and estimated time of arrival at the medical facility.
If a chemical has been ingested, prepare 
                    the ambulance in case the victim vomits toxic material. Have 
                    ready several towels and open plastic bags to quickly clean 
                    up and isolate vomitus.
Multi-Casualty Triage
Consult with the base station physician 
                    or the regional poison control center for advice regarding 
                    triage of multiple victims.
Patients with evidence of ingestion or 
                    substantial inhalation exposure or who have evidence of eye 
                    or skin burns should be transported to a medical facility 
                    for evaluation. Others may be discharged from the scene after 
                    their names, addresses, and telephone numbers are recorded. 
                    Those discharged should be advised to seek medical care promptly 
                    if symptoms develop (see Patient Information Sheet 
                    below).

 Emergency Department Management

Patients who have sodium hydroxide solid or solution on 
                      their skin or clothing can secondarily contaminate hospital 
                      personnel by direct contact. Patients do not pose risks 
                      of secondary contamination after clothing is removed and 
                      the skin is washed.
Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to tissues. The severity 
                      of sodium hydroxide burns may not be readily apparent until 
                      24 to 48 hours after exposure.
Stridor, vomiting, drooling, and abdominal pain are early 
                      symptoms of sodium hydroxide ingestion. Patients who have 
                      ingested sodium hydroxide may progress to shock. Patients 
                      who have inhaled mists or aerosols of sodium hydroxide may 
                      experience laryngeal edema and noncardiogenic pulmonary 
                      edema.
There is no antidote for sodium hydroxide. Treatment consists 
                      of respiratory and cardiovascular support.

Decontamination Area
Unless previously decontaminated, all 
                    patients suspected of contact with solid sodium hydroxide 
                    or its solutions and all victims with skin or eye irritation 
                    require decontamination as described below. Because sodium 
                    hydroxide is extremely corrosive, hospital personnel should 
                    don rubber gloves, rubber aprons, and eye protection before 
                    treating contaminated patients. All other patients may be 
                    transferred to the Critical Care area.
Be aware that use of protective equipment 
                    by the provider may cause fear in children, resulting in decreased 
                    compliance with further management efforts.
Because of their relatively larger surface 
                    area:body weight ratio, children are more vulnerable to toxicants 
                    affecting the skin. Also, emergency room personnel should 
                    examine children's mouths because of the frequency of hand-to-mouth 
                    activity among children.
ABC Reminders
Evaluate and support airway, breathing, 
                    and circulation. Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive 
                    agents than adults because of the smaller diameter of their 
                    airways. Administer 100% humidified supplemental oxygen to 
                    patients who have hypoxemia. In cases of respiratory compromise 
                    secure airway and respiration via endotracheal intubation. 
                    Because of possible corrosive injury, intubation should be 
                    done carefully. If not possible, surgically create an airway.
Treat patients who have bronchospasm 
                    with aerosolized bronchodilators. The use of bronchial sensitizing 
                    agents in situations of multiple chemical exposures may pose 
                    additional risks. Consider the health of the myocardium before 
                    choosing which type of bronchodilator should be administered. 
                    Cardiac sensitizing agents may be appropriate; however, the 
                    use of cardiac sensitizing agents after exposure to certain 
                    chemicals may pose enhanced risk of cardiac arrhythmias (especially 
                    in the elderly). Sodium hydroxide poisoning is not known to 
                    pose additional risk during the use of bronchial or cardiac 
                    sensitizing agents. 
Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed, cautioning for myocardial variability.
Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or have seizures or ventricular arrhythmias should be treated 
                    in the conventional manner. 
Basic Decontamination
Rapid decontamination is critical. 
                    Patients who are able may assist with their own decontamination.
Immediately brush any solid material 
                    from clothes, skin, or hair while protecting the victim's 
                    eyes. Quickly remove contaminated clothing and flush exposed 
                    areas with water for at least 15 minutes. Double-bag contaminated 
                    clothing and personal belongings. Use caution to avoid hypothermia 
                    when decontaminating children or the elderly. Use blankets 
                    or warmers when appropriate.
Flush exposed or irritated eyes with 
                    plain water or saline for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact 
                    lenses if easily removable without additional trauma to the 
                    eye. If a corrosive material is suspected or if pain or injury 
                    is evident, continue irrigation while transferring the victim 
                    to the Critical Care Area.
In cases of ingestion, do not induce 
                    emesis. Do not administer activated charcoal or attempt 
                    to neutralize stomach contents.
Victims who are conscious and able to 
                    swallow can be given 4 to 8 ounces of milk or water if this 
                    has not been given previously (see Critical Care Area 
                    below for more information on ingestion exposure).
Critical Care Area
Be certain that appropriate decontamination 
                    has been carried out (see Decontamination Area above).
ABC Reminders
Evaluate and support airway, breathing, 
                    and circulation as in ABC Reminders above. Children 
                    may be more vulnerable to corrosive agents than adults because 
                    of the smaller diameter of their airways. Establish intravenous 
                    access in seriously ill patients if this has not been done 
                    previously. Continuously monitor cardiac rhythm.
Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or have seizures or cardiac arrhythmias should be treated 
                    in the conventional manner. 
Inhalation Exposure
Administer supplemental oxygen by mask 
                    to patients who have respiratory symptoms. Treat patients 
                    who have bronchospasm with aerosolized bronchodilators. The 
                    use of bronchial sensitizing agents in situations of multiple 
                    chemical exposures may pose additional risks. Consider the 
                    health of the myocardium before choosing which type of bronchodilator 
                    should be administered. Cardiac sensitizing agents may be 
                    appropriate; however, the use of cardiac sensitizing agents 
                    after exposure to certain chemicals may pose enhanced risk 
                    of cardiac arrhythmias (especially in the elderly). Sodium 
                    hydroxide poisoning is not known to pose additional risk during 
                    the use of bronchial or cardiac sensitizing agents. 
Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed, cautioning for myocardial variability.
Skin Exposure
Skin burns from sodium hydroxide should 
                    be irrigated frequently with normal saline for 24 hours. Consider 
                    early (within 1 hour of exposure) institution of continuous 
                    hydrotherapy. Neutralizing substances should not be used. 
                    Fluid resuscitation should be provided as for comparable thermal 
                    burns; keeping in mind that the full extent of the sodium 
                    hydroxide burn may not be accurately assessed for 24 to 48 
                    hours and may be underestimated initially.
Because of their relatively larger surface 
                    area:body weight ratio children are more vulnerable to toxicants 
                    affecting the skin.
Eye Exposure
Continue eye irrigation until the pH 
                    of the conjunctival sac is neutral (pH 7). The pH of the conjunctiva 
                    should be checked every 30 minutes for 2 hours after irrigation 
                    is stopped to ensure that the measured pH is that of the tissue 
                    and not the irrigating fluid. Ensure that any particulate 
                    matter has been removed. A mydriatic-cycloplegic medication 
                    such as homatropine should be used to prevent synechiae. Examine 
                    the eyes for conjunctival or corneal damage and treat appropriately. 
                    Immediately consult an ophthalmologist for patients who have 
                    eye exposure.
Ingestion Exposure
In cases of ingestion, do not induce 
                    emesis. Do not administer activated charcoal or attempt 
                    to neutralize stomach contents.
Victims who are conscious and able to 
                    swallow can be given 4 to 8 ounces of milk or water if this 
                    has not been given previously.
Extreme throat swelling may require endotracheal 
                    intubation or cricothyroidotomy. Gastric lavage is useful 
                    in certain circumstances to remove caustic material and prepare 
                    for endoscopic examination. Consider gastric lavage with a 
                    small nasogastric tube if: (1) a large dose has been ingested; 
                    (2) the patient's condition is evaluated within 30 minutes; 
                    (3) the patient has oral lesions or persistent esophageal 
                    discomfort; and (4) the lavage can be administered within 
                    one hour of ingestion. Placement of the gastric tube should 
                    be guided by endoscopy because blind gastric-tube placement 
                    may further injure the chemically damaged esophagus or stomach.
Endoscopic evaluation is essential in 
                    cases of sodium hydroxide ingestion, and surgical consultation 
                    is recommended for patients who have suspected perforation. 
                    Signs and symptoms do not provide an accurate guide to the 
                    extent of injury. All patients suspected of significant caustic 
                    ingestion must have early endoscopy to assess injury to the 
                    esophagus, stomach and duodenum, and to guide subsequent management. 
                    Severe esophageal burns have occurred even in cases where 
                    burns of the mouth or oropharynx were not seen. The ingestion 
                    of large amounts of sodium hydroxide may also result in shock. 
                    Endoscopy may be contraindicated in cases where the patient 
                    is unstable, has upper airway compromise, evidence of perforation, 
                    or ingestion took place more than 48 hours previously.
Perforation almost always requires surgical 
                    repair.
Because children do not ingest large 
                    amounts of corrosive materials, and because of the risk of 
                    perforation from NG intubation, lavage is discouraged in children 
                    unless performed under endoscopic guidance.
Toxic vomitus or gastric washings should 
                    be isolated (e.g., by attaching the lavage tube to isolated 
                    wall suction or another closed container).
Antidotes and Other Treatments
There is no antidote for sodium hydroxide. 
                    Various treatments to decrease stricture formation have been 
                    proposed (including administration of ascorbic acid and steroids), 
                    but are not recommended.
Laboratory Tests
The diagnosis of acute sodium hydroxide 
                    toxicity is primarily clinical, based on symptoms of corrosive 
                    injury. However, laboratory testing is useful for monitoring 
                    the patient and evaluating complications. Routine laboratory 
                    studies for all exposed patients include CBC, glucose, and 
                    electrolyte determinations. Patients who have respiratory 
                    complaints may require chest radiography and pulse oximetry 
                    (or ABG measurements). Patients with symptoms of severe burns 
                    or perforation may require renal function tests and blood 
                    typing.
Disposition and Follow-up
Consider hospitalizing patients who have 
                    ingested sodium hydroxide or who have eye or serious skin 

                    burns or histories of significant inhalation exposure. Patients 
                    with signs of perforation may require emergency surgery. Those 
                    with significant dermal injury should be admitted to the burn 
                    unit and patients with significant ingestion may need admission 
                    to the intensive care unit.
Delayed Effects
Injury may continue to progress in severity 
                    for up to 48 hours after exposure. Patients may develop upper 
                    airway obstruction, perforation, and shock.
 Severe inhalation injuries may cause 
                    persistent hoarseness and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome 
                    (RADS), a chemically- or irritant-induced type of asthma. 
                  
Patient Release
Patients who have minimal skin exposure 
                    or patients who show no progressive symptoms 6 to 12 hours 
                    after a mild-to-moderate inhalation exposure may be discharged 
                    with instructions to seek medical care promptly if symptoms 
                    develop (see the Sodium Hydroxide-Patient Information Sheet 
                    below).
Follow-up
Obtain the name of the patient's primary 
                    care physician so that the hospital can send a copy of the 
                    ED visit to the patient's doctor.
 For patients who have ingested sodium 
                    hydroxide, esophagoscopy should be performed within 48 hours 
                    of ingestion to assess severity of injury; a flexible instrument 
                    should be used. If perforation has not occurred, consider 
                    follow-up endoscopy or a barium swallow 10 days to 3 weeks 
                    after the initial burn to further assess the injury.
Patients who have corneal, conjunctival, 
                    scleral, or lid lesions should be reexamined within 24 hours.
Reporting
If a work-related incident has occurred, 
                    you may be legally required to file a report; contact your 
                    state or local health department.
Other persons may still be at risk in 
                    the setting where this incident occurred. If the incident 
                    occurred in the workplace, discussing it with company personnel 
                    may prevent future incidents. If a public health risk exists, 
                    notify your state or local health department or other responsible 
                    public agency. When appropriate, inform patients that they 
                    may request an evaluation of their workplace from OSHA or 
                    NIOSH. See Appendices III and IV for a list of agencies that 
                    may be of assistance.

Sodium hydroxide is a white, solid material 
                    that picks up moisture from the air. If put in water, it produces 
                    a large amount of heat. Both the solid and its solutions are 
                    very corrosive and can cause severe burns. Sodium hydroxide 
                    is a member of a group of chemical compounds also known as 
                    bases or alkalies, which can neutralize and are neutralized 
                    by, acids, releasing a lot of heat.
What immediate health effects can be caused by exposure to sodium hydroxide?
Solid sodium hydroxide or strong solutions 
                    produce immediate pain when they come in contact with any 
                    part of the body. Weak solutions may not produce pain for 
                    several hours, but serious burns can result even from weak 
                    solutions if they are not washed off quickly. Spilling sodium 
                    hydroxide over large areas of the skin or swallowing sodium 
                    hydroxide may cause shock and even death. Sodium hydroxide 
                    can break down proteins and generates heat when dissolving 
                    in water. Contact with sensitive tissues, such as the eyes, 
                    is particularly dangerous and can cause permanent damage or 
                    even blindness.
Can sodium hydroxide poisoning be treated?
There is no antidote for sodium hydroxide, 
                    but the burns and shock it can cause can be treated. Patients 
                    who develop serious symptoms need to be hospitalized.
Are any future health effects likely to occur?
A single small exposure from which a 
                    person recovers quickly is not likely to cause delayed or 
                    long-term effects. After a serious exposure to large areas 
                    of the skin, scarring may occur that will require skin grafts. 
                    A serious eye exposure can result in blindness. If sodium 
                    hydroxide mist was breathed, permanent injury to the lungs 
                    may result. If a solution was swallowed, damage to the mouth, 
                    throat, and esophagus may cause permanent scarring, making 
                    swallowing difficult.
What tests can be done if a person has been exposed to sodium hydroxide?
Specific tests for the presence of sodium 
                    hydroxide in blood or urine are not available. If a severe 
                    exposure has occurred, blood and urine analyses and other 
                    tests may show whether the lungs, eyes, or stomach has been 
                    injured. Testing is not needed in every case.
Where can more information about sodium hydroxide be found?
More information about sodium hydroxide 
                    can be obtained from your regional poison control center; 
                    your state, county, or local health department; the Agency 
                    for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR); your doctor; 
                    or a clinic in your area that specializes in occupational 
                    and environmental health. If the exposure happened at work, 
                    you may wish to discuss it with your employer, the Occupational 
                    Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), or the National Institute 
                    for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Ask the person 
                    who gave you this form for help in locating these telephone 
                    numbers.
