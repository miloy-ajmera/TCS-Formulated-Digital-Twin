Product Name: SOFTIGEN®PURA
INCI: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Hydrogenated
Rapeseed Oil
DESCRIPTION: SOFTIGEN®PURA is a blend of natural triglyceri-
des of 100% vegetable origin. SOFTIGEN®PURA based products
are easily spreadable and give a smooth and velvety skin feel.
This makes this natural ingredient the ideal base for rich creams,
balms and butters. It is a multifunctional cream base with similar
properties (stability against oxidation, occlusivity) as conventional
petrolatum. SOFTIGEN®PURA is colorless, odorless and has a
very long shelf life.
Product Name: SOFTISAN® 378
INCI: Caprylic/Capric/Myristic/Stearic Triglyceride
DESCRIPTION: A specialty blend of triglycerides based on
saturated even numbered, unbranched natural fatty acids of
vegetable origin. With its low melting point, it leaves a non-tacky
and non-greasy film on the skin. SOFTISAN® 378 has a pasty
consistency, a high oxidative stability and offers the same
benefits as Shea Butter. It is a perfect base for pasty product
concepts, lip products or body butters. It imparts structure to the
finished products and yet has a surprisingly light skin feel.
Product Name: MIGLYOL® OE
INCI: Oleyl Erucate
DESCRIPTION: Liquid wax ester with similar properties as
natural jojoba oil. For the task of providing care and shine for skin,
hair or color cosmetics, it is a cost-effective alternative to jojoba
oil. Along with its rich skin feel and long playtime it reduces tacki-
ness of vegetable oils and other triglycerides.
Product Name: MIGLYOL® DO
INCI: Decyl Oleate
DESCRIPTION: This medium spreading, non-polar emollient
helps reduce the tackiness of care formulations. MIGLYOL® DO
imparts a light, well-caring skin feel and is an interesting alterna-
tive to MCT oils.
Product Name: MIGLYOL® Coco 810
INCI: Coco-Caprylate/Caprate
DESCRIPTION: This fast spreading non-polar and non-oily
emollient and refatting agent can be considered a true vegetable
alternative for light petrochemical based emollients like mineral
oils or silicones (e.g. D5). Due to its extremely light skin feel and
fast spreading, MIGLYOL® Coco 810 provides an elegant skin
feel. It is non-oxidizable and odorless. With this balanced emolli-
ent profile, it is an excellent choice for all kinds of skin care, hair
care, massage products and many more.
Product Name: MIGLYOL® 8810
INCI: Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate
DESCRIPTION: Due to its polarity and dry, non-oily skin feel, this
ester oil is an excellent solvent for UV sunscreens and a perfect
alternative to low molecular weight silicones. A low viscosity and
easy spreading properties facilitate the even distribution of sun
care products on the skin. This makes MIGLYOL® 8810 one of the
most popular emollients for sun care and BB creams throughout
the world.
Product Name: MIGLYOL® PPG 810
INCI: Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate
DESCRIPTION: A polar oil component with a fast spreading
capability. It acts as an emollient and leaves a light, non-oily,
smooth and velvety skin sensation similar to low molecular
weight silicone oils. Furthermore, it shows excellent dispersing
and dissolving properties for pigments and sunscreens.
Product Name: MIGLYOL® 829
INCI: Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride
DESCRIPTION: Caprylic/capric triglyceride units crosslinked
with succinic acid to form a larger molecule with unique proper-
ties. Higher viscosity and medium to slow spreading combined
with an excellent lubrication effect give a rich but elegant skin
sensation and long playtime. The specific density close to that
of water provides extra stability in emulsions and allows to for-
mulate two-phase products with aqueous base.
Product Name: MIGLYOL® 829 ECO
INCI: Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride
DESCRIPTION: Caprylic/capric triglyceride units crosslinked
with succinic acid to form a 100% natural molecule with unique
properties. Higher viscosity and medium to slow spreading com-
bined with an excellent lubrication effect give a rich but elegant
skin sensation and long playtime. The specific density close to
that of water provides extra stability in emulsions and allows to
formulate two-phase products with aqueous base.

Product Name: IMWITOR® 948
INCI: Glyceryl Oleate
Typical Dosage: 1.0–3.0
HLB: 3
DESCRIPTION: IMWITOR® 948 is a versatile non-ionic co-emul-
sifier with a monoester content of 32–52% that can be used in

of emollients into the stratum corneum and enhances skin ela-
sticity. Used in body washes, Glyceryl Oleate reduces skin rough-
ness caused by surfactants. Glyceryl oleate is also part of human
hair lipids. Once adsorbed by the hair, it reduces roughness, thus
decreasing combing force of wet hair and enhancing hair gloss.

Product Name: SOFTISAN® conditionHAIR
INCI: PCA Glyceryl Oleate
DESCRIPTION: A palm-free, vegan hair conditioner and skin
moisturizer. It is 100% natural-based and suitable for natural
cosmetics. In hair care products, it leads to better combability
and works in synergy with hydrophobic materials in order to
improve the combability of the hair, just like standard cationics.
In skin care applications, due to the presence of pyrrolidone
carboxylic acid (PCA), also part of the natural moisturizing factor
(NMF), it has a positive influence on the humidity level of the skin
and protects the skin barrier by reducing the trans-epidermal
water loss (TEWL).
Product Name: SOFTISAN® 645

excellent skin compatibility is proven and allergic skin reactions
are not reported.
Product Name: SOFTISAN® 649
INCI: Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2
DESCRIPTION: A palm-based (available in RSPO MB) and vegan

le-based alternatives to mineral oil-based Ozokerite.

Raw  material approved by ECOCERT GREENLIFE,
compliant with the COSMOS standard.
Product Names: WITARIX® MCT 60/40,
WITARIX® MCT 60/40 coconut based
INCI: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride
DESCRIPTION: This classic emollient is also known as neutral oil
because of its pure characteristics based on carefully selected raw
materials. The product exhibits excellent skin smoothing proper-
ties and can be used to promote skin penetration. Caprylic/Capric
Triglycerides are odorless and stable against oxidation. Because
of their exceptional stability and versatility, MCT oils are among
the most widely used emollients in personal care applications. The
totally neutral taste and food-grade status make MCT oil also very
popular for lip products of all kinds. All qualities available as RSPO
MB grade as well.
Product Name: WITARIX® MCT 70/30
INCI: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride
DESCRIPTION: Type of Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) with
a higher amount of C8 fatty acid compared to WITARIX® MCT
60/40.
Product Names: WITARIX® MCT C8,
WITARIX® MCT C8 pure coconut
INCI: Tricaprylin
DESCRIPTION: WITARIX® MCT C8 is the redefined version of
our bestseller WITARIX® MCT 60/40. It is a 100% vegan, natural
and colorless liquid of low viscosity. Due to its high polarity, it is
a perfect fit for any kind of sun care and color cosmetic formula-
tions. Tricaprylin is able to disperse and dissolve commonly used
UV filters and pigments while still leading to a good spreadability
and pleasant skin feel. Also known as a sensory transformer, its
medium spreading properties and the appealing oily and rich
feel (just like MCT) turn into a very light, non-oily skin feel with
striking silkiness and smoothness after absorption. Available in
RSPO MB quality and as a palm-free version (pure coconut).
Product Name: MIGLYOL® T-C7
INCI: Triheptanoin
DESCRIPTION: MIGLYOL® T-C7 is a 100% natural product,
based on heptanoic acid derived from castor oil and palm-free.
In contrast to other triglycerides, MIGLYOL® T-C7 leaves a
light, gently lubricating and velvety skin sensation. Due to its
shorter chain length, this triglyceride has an increased polarity
and shows excellent dispersing and dissolving properties for
pigments and UV filters. The low viscosity makes it particularly
suitable for use in wet wipe lotions.
