It works but the ingredients need to be modified to keep up with the expectations of informed, health conscious consumers.
Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2016Verified Purchase
This product is fantastic and it works. However, I have used Babor since I was 22. Until recently I had been a huge promoter of their products. I liked to think they were more natural in the past or perhaps I was less aware of their ingredients. I have recently become aware of ingredients ( e.g. propylene glycol, Bytelene glycol ) in their products that in light of new evidence should be removed. I have written to them about this concern. The response was the toxins are below the recommended carcinogenic percentage. I am now 57 so have been with them for 35 years. I express my desire to keep using their products and implored them to consider modifying their ingredients to natural food grade ingredients. I would pay more for an alternative version without the toxins. I could give one star but I'm hoping awareness will make them adapt before the greater public starts saying no to their products. I am transitioning to all genuinely natural and organic products. Their current organic range does not cut it for me. I gave it to my niece. It is far too drying for my mature skin. I honour your informed decision.

I Love This Moisturizer!
Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020Verified Purchase
Love this product!It feels so good on my face.  I'm very picky when it comes to any type of moisturizer I use.  It can't be oily or greasy or sticky.  This soaks into your skin & my face feels amazing.

Klare Kaufempfehlung!!!
Reviewed in Germany on January 8, 2020Verified Purchase
Eigentlich benutze ich hochwertige Naturkosmetik(Pharmos), nur wollte ich was neues ausprobieren.Da mir die Produkte von Barbor schon mehrfach empfohlen wurden,entschied ich mich zum Kauf und bin wirklich zufrieden.Die Creme ist ergiebig und sorgt für ein frisches Gefühl und wacheres, jüngeres Aussehen der Augenpartie.

Babor HSR Extra Firming Eye Cream
Reviewed in Germany on July 9, 2019Verified Purchase
Das ist nicht meine erste Augencreme von Babor. Leider ist die andere Augencreme nicht mehr zu bekommen. Deshalb war ich ein wenig skeptisch, ob diese Augencreme ohne Duftstoffe ist, da ich allergisch auf Duftstoffe bin.Ich bin beigeistert, Tränensäcke und Falten sind weniger geworden beziehungsweise sind in den Hintergrund getreten. Die Augenpartie ist nicht mehr so angeschwollen. Die Creme ist parfümfrei....super.  Ich kann diese Augencreme nur weiterempfehlen und kann nicht verstehen, dass diese Creme zurückgeschickt wird, mit dem Hinweis "man würde mehr Falten davon bekommen" ???

Die goldene Kugel ist sehr ansprechend, wenn es ein Geschenk sein soll. Für die tägliche Nutzung der Augencreme sollte es eine preiswertere Lösung geben.
