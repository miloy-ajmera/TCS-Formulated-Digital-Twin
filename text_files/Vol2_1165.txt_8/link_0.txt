        AMPHISOL® K , the formulators’ choice for stabilizing the most challenging formulations 
    




AMPHISOL® K is an oil-in-water emulsifier designed to meet high stability needs of challenging and complex formulations like sunscreens, skin care and make-up formulations. Its exclusive microdomains technology allows formulators to stabilize the most versatile combinations of personal care ingredients, even those with high loads of pigment and high contents of oil, ethanol, and electrolytes. This emulsifier ingredient provides high flexibility to formulate various types of products, from creams to sprays and mousses. AMPHISOL® K has proven performance in the most challenging formulations, including in spray formulations, compared to other main benchmarks and PCPs. Further it can also be used as a co-emulsifier to rescue and beautify your challenging make-up, skin care and sun care formulations, making processing easier.

        Why formulation stability matters
    




Consumers from our "DSM Consumer Insights Hub" say they are unlikely to buy a personal care product a second time if problems with stability make it unpleasant to use. To learn more about why formulation quality and stability matter- right to the very last drop - check out the insights in our video.

        Microdomains technology
    




AMPHISOL® K does not only form both, liquid crystalline lamellar and vesicle structures in your formulation, it will also form unique Microdomains to ensure the quality of your product until the last drop! The micro-domains made of AMPHISOL® K are negatively charged and create the repulsion of the liquid cristalline vesicles which ensures the ultimate stability of the emulsion.

AMPHISOL® K creates foam that wows and calms and enfolds
Designed to meet the high stability needs of challenging and complex formulations, inherently biodegradable AMPHISOL® K helps you create more stable emulsions, faster. And, with new studies showing the performance of AMPHISOL® K in cleansers, it’s a great time to experience new well-being rituals by enhancing the foam volume, stability and texture.
