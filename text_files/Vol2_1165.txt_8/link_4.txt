Hyaluronic acid, also referred to in skincare as hyaluronate or HA, is a water-loving polysaccharide already present in the skin. With age, hyaluronic acid in the skin decreases quite sharply, resulting in a loss of hydration, volume and plumpness. Lines and wrinkles also appear, and skin is left looking dull and lackluster. Usually, when hyaluronic acid is added to skincare products, its humectant properties draw moisture into the skin, helping to combat dryness and dullness. What many people don’t realize is that hyaluronic acid comes in various molecular sizes. Larger molecules stay on the surface and give the skin a ‘dewy’ look, while smaller molecules penetrate deeper into the skin to deliver their hydration benefits.
