This essence can either be used for a special-effect (effect for a day or for a particular occasion) or as a treatment program (sustained improvement in the condition of the skin).  A treatment can last 1–4 weeks, depending on the intensity required.
TO USE:  Apply approximately 2 pipettes (.7 ml) to face, neck and decollete daily – in the morning and/or in the evening – after cleansing and before applying moisturizer.  Let it soak in briefly before applying moisturizer. Epigran can be used around the eyes for clearly positive results.  This is also available in ampoules.
