                            Using Allantoin in Skincare Formulations
Allantoin enhances the efficacy and appeal of dermatological and cosmetic formulations by acting as a skin protectant and providing necessary moisture. It works as an exceptional healing, moisturizing, soothing and anti-irritating agent. Adding allantoin as an emollient to a formulation can help soothe and prevent dry, rough and itchy skin.  

How Allantoin works
Allantoin is a crystallized oxidation product of uric acid found naturally in many plants. It enhances the efficacy and appeal of dermatological and cosmetic formulations by acting as a skin protectant and providing necessary hydration. The addition of Allantoin to cosmetic formulations results in softer, suppler skin.

In addition to moisturizing, Allantoin also helps to gently exfoliate the skin by softening the top layer of skin. Because of its soothing properties as a keratolytic agent, it can be a great ingredient in formulations developed to reduce dullness or for sensitive, acne-prone skin. 

Since Allantoin is both a skin protectant and moisturizer, it helps protect against trans-epidermal water loss. Preventing moisture loss is important for calming irritated skin and improving skin texture for all skin types.

Uses of Allantoin
Allantoin has been used in a wide variety of personal care products and cosmetics for decades due to its gentleness and effectiveness including:

  Skincare use for
    
      Creams, lotions and cleansers for the face, hands and body
      Lip balms
      Shave and Aftershave products
      Serums, toners and masks
      Sunscreens
    
  Bath and shower products
  Makeup and cosmetics
  Haircare
  Infant products


Safety of Allantoin
Most emollients, such as allantoin, are generally considered safe for human use on a daily basis, as well as safe for the environment. The US FDA has classified allantoin as an OTC Category I active ingredient (safe) for use at 0.5% to 2.0%. In addition, this means that allantoin is effective as a skin protectant even at low concentrations for cosmetic use. 
The FDA has approved the following statements for nonprescription drug products containing 0.5% - 2.0%:

  For the temporary protection of minor cuts, scraps, burns and sunburn
  Helps prevent and temporarily protect chafed, chapped, cracked or wind-burned skin and lips. 
  Relieves dryness, and softens cold sores and fever blisters
  Helps treat and prevent diaper rash. And protects chafed skin/minor skin irritation due to/associated with diaper rash and helps protect from/seal out wetness. view less

Fision KeraVeg18 is a cohesive solution containing wheat & soy amino acids, with additional pure amino acids carefully selected to mimic the functional ratios in commercial human hair amino acids. Comparison studies were conducted on Fision KeraVeg18 vs. hydrolyzed animal keratin, showing Fision KeraVeg18 has properties comparable to, or in some cases, better than, hydrolyzed animal keratin. This keratin alternative protects hair from harsh salon processes, improves combability and reduces damage from excess force used against hair. view less
