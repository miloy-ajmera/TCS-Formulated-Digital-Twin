172585B Dragosantol® Bisabolol and Farnesol
Dragosantol® contains at least 85 % of d,l-alpha-bisabolol, a monocyclic unsaturated sesquiterpene alcohol. Ingredients of secondary importance are mainly farnesol isomers.

 Dragosantol® has been shown to possess soothing properties for stressed and sensitive skin.
 Moreover, body odor control effectiveness has been demonstrated both for d,l-alpha-bisabolol and for Dragosantol®.

Dragosantol® is suitable for use in cosmetic products due to its stability and good compatibility to the skin. The main areas of application for Dragosantol® are skin care cosmetic preparations, in particular lotions and creams for sensitive skin.

 Unlike Azulen or camomile oil, Dragosantol® does not alter its color after long storage periods nor diffuse through plastic containers; therefore it can be used without problems.

Dragosantol®
Bisabolol and FarnesolOdor: characteristicUse: Dragosantol® contains at least 85 % of d,l-alpha-bisabolol, a monocyclic unsaturated sesquiterpene alcohol. Ingredients of secondary importance are mainly farnesol isomers.

 Dragosantol® has been shown to possess soothing properties for stressed and sensitive skin.
 Moreover, body odor control effectiveness has been demonstrated both for d,l-alpha-bisabolol and for Dragosantol®.

Dragosantol® is suitable for use in cosmetic products due to its stability and good compatibility to the skin. The main areas of application for Dragosantol® are skin care cosmetic preparations, in particular lotions and creams for sensitive skin.

 Unlike Azulen or camomile oil, Dragosantol® does not alter its color after long storage periods nor diffuse through plastic containers; therefore it can be used without problems.
Symrise
Farnesol Plus
Odor: characteristicUse: Farnesol Plus is a nature identical, synergistic complex of active ingredients with deodorising properties. Farnesol Plus is composed of Farnesol, Phenoxyethanol, Glycerine monolaurate.
Symrise
Farnesol special
Odor: very mild and delicate green floral odor with typical lily of the valley characterUse: Stable in:  body lotion (very good), shampoo (good), soap (good), ap roll-on (poor), powder (poor), cleaner citric (poor), cleaner apc (very good), bleach (poor).Flavor: sweet, flowery, juicyUseful in:  mint, fruity citrus, fruity red, fruity yellow, fruity tropical, fruity others, sweet others, alcoholics.

 Notes: 
IFRA FLAVOR REQUIREMENTS:
Due to the possible ingestion of small amounts of fragrance ingredients from their use in products in Categories 1 and 6, materials must not only comply with IFRA Standards but must also be recognized as safe as a flavoring ingredient as defined by the IOFI Code of Practice (www.iofi.org). For more details see chapter 1 of the Guidance for the use of IFRA Standards.

Notes: Enhances the odor of sweet florals. a colorless liquid extracted from oils of plants such as citronella, neroli, cyclamen, and tuberose. it is an intermediate step in the biological synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonic acid in vertebrates. it has a delicate odor and is used in perfumery. (from mcgraw-hill dictionary of scientific and technical terms, 5th ed) Component of many flower absolutes [CCD]

Farnesol is a natural organic compound which is an acyclic sesquiterpene alcohol found as a colorless liquid. It is insoluble in water, but miscible with oils. It is the building block of most, and possibly all, acyclic sesquiterpenoids and is an important starting compound for organic synthesis. [Wikipedia]
