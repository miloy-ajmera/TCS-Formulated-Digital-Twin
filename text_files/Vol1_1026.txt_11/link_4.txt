The invention of this cold cream recipe is credited to Galen, a physician in the second century from Greece. This cold cream is thick and softens when it touches the skin.  It is perfect for dry skin on elbow, feet, and knees and also perfect for natural ways of removing makeup and to avoid eczema in dry parts of your body.
Galen was one of the first to be known to make a link between the body and soul and how to treat sickness looking at the four humor (blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile). You can actually find some of his work translated from Greek in this book: Selected Work By Galen
This Galen Cold cream recipe is without borax. Borax is also known as sodium borate which helps binding water and oil. Beeswax is here an effective emulsifier that binds water and oil. The only trick is that you have to be careful with the ratio water vs oil. If you put too much water, your cream will separate.
How to make this Galen cold cream recipe is a very simple process that requires 3 ingredients:
Rosewater
Rosewater (also called rose hydrosol) is a bi-product of the rose essential oil distillation process. It helps to balance the skin sebum production and is used to enhance circulation.
Olive Oil or Almond Oil
I prefer to substitute Olive oil with almond oil because I like the scent better, plus it is less greasy than olive oil.
Almond oil has many benefits for the skin. It is naturally rich in Vitamin E, monounsaturated fatty acids, proteins, potassium, and zinc.
Beeswax
As you know, beeswax is the hard labor of the bees and beeswax which create a natural emulsion and binds the water and the oil together.
 
I’ve seen many forums claiming that you cannot create a cold cream recipe without using a chemical emulsifier like borax, sorbitol & stearic acid.
This is not true. You can create a cream with simple ingredients as in this cold cream recipe below. If you use chemical emulsifiers, you will need to use preservatives like triclosan or Caprylyl Glycol. You can skip all that nonsense. The reasons those chemicals were created is to have long shelf life, 2 to 5 years. That allows commercial cosmetic companies to make more money, at the expense of our health.
Make small batches, use clean and sterilized utensils as well as tools and surfaces. The shelf life of this cream is between 2 to 4 weeks.
Use clean hands when you handle the product and most of it use common sense! If you see mold or the cream is smelling off, throw it away!

    MarkOctober 14, 2022 / 5:45 pm If I were to add borax to the rose water, how much do you recommend? I know it doesn’t need it, but it’s something I prefer to use. Reply 



 KanchanDecember 6, 2020 / 11:05 am Just made this. I added Geranium and Frankincense essential oils. Love the texture of thos cream. Never going back to store bought creams. Thank you so much for the recipe. Reply

    Eve CabanelAuthorDecember 22, 2020 / 2:41 am thanks Kanchan 🙂 Reply 


    VictoriaNovember 19, 2020 / 12:28 pm I’ve been using the cream I made using this recipe and I can honestly say I will never go back to shop-bought! I have combination skin which tends to be oily across the forehead, nose and chin but can be sensitive and dry in patches. This has honestly made my skin glow! Tone is more even, pores smaller. I’m really delighted with the results. After leaving on my face for a minute or two I wipe off makeup etc. with a warm face cloth but use it as a moisturiser too, when my skin needs a bit of TLC. Thank you Eve! I’m now hooked and will be perusing your site for more recipes to try. x Reply 



 EstherAugust 31, 2020 / 4:39 pm Hi Eve, How long does this cold cream last for? Reply

    Eve CabanelAuthorSeptember 2, 2020 / 3:18 pm Hi esther, 2 to 4 weeks but you can add a drop of organic grapefruit seed extract to extend the shelf life. Reply 





 Barbara SmithApril 26, 2020 / 12:45 pm Can Beeswax be substituted if so what do you recommend? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorApril 27, 2020 / 3:15 pm not for this cold cream, beeswax gives the best results but you could try with candellila wax or carnauba wax, cant guarantee the results tho, will have to test! Reply 





 KathyFebruary 26, 2020 / 5:50 am I made 4 jars of this today and they all turned out perfect. I neglected to read the instructions in one pan and heated until the bees wax melted then whipped it up! No need to heat the rose water separately. Next time I am going to add more beeswax to make it less greasy. Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorMarch 9, 2020 / 11:52 pm more beeswax will make it more greasy and will give a waxy feeling! Reply 


    FawnJune 23, 2019 / 6:07 am Thank you for the recipe! I purchased the ingredients at my local apothecary and used bees wax from the farmers market. It whipped up perfectly! I think I will use a little more beeswax next time to mitigate greasiness, and I prefer grape seed oil so I used that. I followed your directions closely and had brilliant results. It’s been a couple hours and has not separated yet. I like not using borax, I go through this quickly enough that it doesn’t go rancid. I also just used regular water, but will try a hydrosol next time. I was purchasing cold cream online but it got pricey and I’m not timid when it comes to diy. Thank you so much for your guidance, you’re an angel! Reply 
    Deborah DouglasJune 22, 2019 / 10:58 am Hi could you use frankincense myrr or geranium instead of rose otto I’ve got rose damask 8% diluted in jojaba oil think it’s 8 or 3 can’t quite see . Reply 
    Michelle ZentmyerJune 9, 2019 / 10:39 pm  I made this and used it. I followed the directions exactly and it came out smooth and creamy. I used olive oil as that’s what I have on hand and I made my own rose water. It removed all of my makeup and left my skin soft. Thank you for this recipe!!! Reply 



 ÖzgeMay 14, 2019 / 6:48 pm Dear Eve. Thank you for your beauty recipes. I tried and my cream seperated. What can ı do to mix again this oil phase and water phase ? Thanks a lot:) Özge Akgül Reply




 Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorMay 18, 2019 / 12:56 am Hello Ozge, are you sure the oil and water are at the same temperature when you mix them? If so, increase the amount of oil, that should help with the emulsion. Reply

    Özge AKGÜLJune 12, 2019 / 10:45 am Thank you for your advice ı will try. Reply 
    HeatherNovember 3, 2019 / 2:17 am  Thanks Eve for this lovely recipe. I mixed my batch and it blended beautifully. Then hours later I see it is separating. Is it too late now to fix it? Can I warm it all together and remix? It’s such a shame to toss it. Reply 







 MorganMarch 2, 2019 / 11:12 am I have rosacea, would this help with my redness? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorMarch 6, 2019 / 4:37 pm if you have acne, i would suggest you to follow this recipe instead https://www.organic-beauty-recipes.com/natural-skin-care-routine-to-avoid-acne/ Reply 





 RuthJanuary 28, 2019 / 12:06 pm
 Hi Eve
Is there an alternative to rosewater – I’m not too keen on the smell! Could I use distilled water or orange blossom water? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorJanuary 29, 2019 / 11:03 pm Hi ruth, yes you can use orange blossom water/hydrosol. I don’t recommend distilled water as it has no properties for the skin! Reply 





 JakeNovember 12, 2018 / 10:33 am How much borax would you recommend for this recipe if one was to add it? Reply




 Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorNovember 12, 2018 / 9:36 pm Hi Jake, I don’t recommend using borax in DIY beauty products- Health Canada’s science-based screening assessment recommends minimizing exposure. it can be a skin irritant and also potentially disrupt hormones. You don’t need it in this recipe. Reply

    B PATERSONNovember 5, 2020 / 9:23 am Discupt hormones? Ok DNA as well? Reply 







 MarkNovember 3, 2018 / 5:21 am I followed this to the letter…as I started mixing this with a beater on low it turned into a cream for three seconds. Then it seperated. I kept mixing for three minutes but it never combined. It looked like butter icing you put on cakes with water on top. Reply




 Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorDecember 21, 2018 / 10:11 pm Hi Mark, did you make sure the water is the same temperature as the oil? otherwise, yes your cream can separate. If this happens again, reduce the amount of water. Reply

    Guru KaurDecember 2, 2019 / 3:54 pm Thank you so much for this recipe. I’ve made it three times so far and know that it will be perfect when I manage to stop it splitting. Meanwhile I’ve been using the separated concoction and mixing it back to a cream in my hand before applying it. It’s really wonderful. I’ve narrowed the problem down thanks to your comments and replies above. It splits while it is cooling. Than I realized it’s winter here which means cold and very damp. Neither of those are good for mayonnaise I’ve been told. My solution is next time to cool the hars in the yoghurt maker on its lowest setting before transferring them to the store cupboard. Reply 







 MarkOctober 17, 2018 / 8:04 am Hello I have three questions… When you talk about putting the water into another double boiler to bring it to the same temperature do you mean the rose water? Can you use a hand blender rather than beaters? Can you keep the cold cream in the fridge the whole time or do you recommend keeping it at room temperature? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorOctober 17, 2018 / 10:41 pm Thanks for your questions Mark. yes water = rosewater. You can use a hand immersion blender like this one here: https://www.organic-beauty-recipes.com/mixer instead of an egg beater. I would keep the cream in room temperature. If you put it in the fridge it will last longer but the oil and water may separate. Hope this helps! Reply 





 Mark PritchardAugust 23, 2018 / 6:57 pm Hi Eve can you tell me how you sterilise your equipment please?  I have always been interested in making natural skincare products so i’m looking forward to trying some of your recipes 🙂 Reply




 Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorAugust 23, 2018 / 8:20 pm I have a dish washer that has a sanitize option (high temperature). Alternatively, once utensils are washed, you can bowl them for a few minutes to sanitize it. Reply




 MarkAugust 28, 2018 / 9:27 am Hi Eve I made this cold cream today and the Rose moisturiser. Do you find these creams greasy? I’m used to making creams and lotions using Olivem 1000 as the emulsifier. These beeswax creams feel a lot more greasy to me. The cold cream works as a cleanser as you wipe it off with a face cloth but the rose cream feels to greasy for me to use as a moisturiser. Think I’d rather use a few drops of oil mixed with aloe vera gel. That works very well for me.  Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorSeptember 4, 2018 / 8:00 pm Hi Mark, you don’t need to use a lot and should wipe off the excess with a cotton pad. I love using rose water and a few drops of jojoba oil to remove make up, works great for me as well. Reply 









 TessJuly 6, 2018 / 9:50 am Hey, great recipe! Have you tried using honey as a preservative ever? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorAugust 21, 2018 / 8:43 pm no, but honey is antibacterial so this may help! Reply 





 JennyApril 16, 2018 / 5:40 pm Hi! What is the best way to know If the oils and water are same temperature? What will happen If theyre not? Reply




 Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorApril 19, 2018 / 1:36 am Use a termometer. I don’t bother usually using a termometer but you can. As long as the oil and water are warm (not hot), it will emulsify. If the water is cold and oils hot, it will be hard to form a cream (to emulsify) Reply

    JennyApril 26, 2018 / 8:09 pm  Yay I succeeded! Thankyou very much for this recipe. I am so happy,this was the first time trying something like this.I am surprised how easy it was even thought my tools were pretty limited and I had to hand whip it.Excited now to try More recipes.:)  I didn’t find a termometer, so i heated the oils and water in separate jars but on same pan with water. Reply 







 KayMarch 30, 2018 / 1:33 am Can we use apricot oil or argon oil Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorApril 6, 2018 / 8:19 pm yes you could try, that should work. Reply 
    Lisa KennedyAugust 25, 2018 / 10:06 am Apricot is great Reply 





 JayMarch 29, 2018 / 3:29 pm Can you use grapeseed oil instead of olive/almond oil? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorApril 6, 2018 / 8:19 pm sure! Reply 


    SarahMarch 24, 2018 / 10:37 pm  Excellent recipe! I have had a difficult time finding a good cold cream recipe that didn’t use borax and actually emulsified. I will be using this recipe from now on! My sensitive skin loves cold cream as a face wash. Thank you for the great recipe! Reply 



 ThokanMarch 19, 2018 / 9:56 am Hi Since this has.rosewater .does it not need a preservative? Also what is the shelf life of this cream.  Thank you  Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorMarch 26, 2018 / 9:01 pm 1 month shelve life as long as you use a sterile container and always clean hands. I don’t use chemical preservatives. Reply 





 chrisMarch 18, 2018 / 12:00 am Can you make this without the essential oils? Or will it mess up the conistency? some say essential oils are irritating to skin. Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorMarch 18, 2018 / 4:14 pm Essential oils are always optional. Essential oils must always be diluted and some should not be applied to the skin like for example lemon as they are phototoxic. Reply 





 KhrushchevMarch 17, 2018 / 6:01 pm How can I add lanolin to this recipe? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorMarch 18, 2018 / 4:17 pm thats not needed. lanolin is a wax secreted by the sebaceous glands of sheeps. I prefer to avoid it! Reply 





 TimiMarch 2, 2018 / 10:10 am
 Hi Eve, I just made this recept and it turned uit very nice!!! I am curious how it will work, I give for sure a month to it to see result!
Thank you very much!!!

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorMarch 2, 2018 / 4:50 pm awesome!! thanks timi Reply 





 SunDecember 22, 2017 / 9:31 am Can I use polawax instead then the emulsifying separating problem wld be fix right? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorDecember 28, 2017 / 6:26 pm I would not use polawax as its a chemical and not a natural ingredient. Reply 





 RhianDecember 21, 2017 / 3:36 pm Hi, I have used this recipe to make 2 batches and it has been beautiful, but I now want to make a pot for my mother and although I’m doing exactly the same thing it just won’t emulsify. I’ve tried 3 times and even reduced the water by half. I’m so sad about it! Any thoughts? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorDecember 28, 2017 / 6:25 pm Hi Rhian, you have to make sure the hydrosol or flower water is the same temperature (a bit warm) as the oils. Otherwise it won’t emulsify. Hope that helps! Reply 





 sakinaDecember 11, 2017 / 10:57 am
 Heyy my cream is so hard to apply…what should i do now..how to make it creamy…plz answer Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorDecember 18, 2017 / 12:17 am Hi sakina, add more almond oil. Reply 





 maxineNovember 15, 2017 / 3:05 am
 HI just wondering if it would be possible to use light coconut oil to make cream less oily Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorNovember 18, 2017 / 8:46 pm Hi maxime, yes you can try but the consistency will not be the same. If you want to make this cream less oily, add a teaspoon of arrowroot powder. https://www.organic-beauty-recipes.com/arrowroot Reply 





 HendOctober 5, 2017 / 9:35 pm Hello. Thank you for these recipe. I have few questions please Is there an alternative for beewax? Do we need to heat up the water? Do we need to add preservative? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorOctober 7, 2017 / 5:04 pm Hi hend, you could use carnauba wax or soy wax as a substitute for beeswax but you would need to modify the recipe a bit. Regarding the rosewater, yes it needs to be heated up in a separate double boiler as mentioned in the instructions. I dont use preservatives as they are chemicals, make small batches and keep in the fridge. Reply 





 BreeSeptember 23, 2017 / 1:54 am Hello. Thank you for these recipe. I have active break outs and want to try home made cold cream. Can I use hemp oil? And distilled water instead of rosewater? Thank you! Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorSeptember 23, 2017 / 2:12 am Hi Bree, yes you can use hemp oil and I would use a hydrosol (rosewater or chammomile water or tea tree hydrosol) instead of distilled water. Distilled water is dead, has no minerals, no salt and you cannot keep the cream long as it would mold. Reply 





 CarolinaJune 27, 2017 / 3:42 am Would shea butter work as a substitute for the beeswax? Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorJune 30, 2017 / 4:59 pm HI carolina, no, you need the beeswax as a natural emulsifier (which bings the oil and water content together) Reply 





 FraserJune 17, 2017 / 9:43 am Since I only have rose Otto 100% can I just use 2 drops or do I have to dilute it first to get the right consistency? Reply




 Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorJune 30, 2017 / 5:20 pm 1% dilution for 2Oz is 10-12 drops of pure essential oil, no need to dilute it further, just add the drops to your cream at the end of the process. Reply




 Ana VilaçaJuly 7, 2017 / 10:00 am
 Hello Eve!
I’m trying to emulsify my creams only with beeswax. Following your recipe, finally, I’ve got it! However, a few hours later, it starts to separate… Usually, I store the creams in the refrigerator. Could it be the problem? Should I keep it at room temperature?
Thank you.
Namaste.
Ana Reply




 Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorJuly 9, 2017 / 3:41 pm Hi Ana,  If your cream starts to separate, it can be because you are using too much water content vs oil content, try reducing the water content. Also, it may be that you are not mixing long enough once the emulsion has taken place. What is the ratio rose water versus oil you are using? Reply

    Ana VilaçaAugust 5, 2017 / 2:47 pm  Hi Eve! I´m using 45% of water and 45% of oils. I´m using unrefined beeswax. Could it be the problem? Yhanks Namaste 
    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorAugust 8, 2017 / 1:13 am Hi ana, are you using min 10% of beeswax? as for water, you mean rosewater? its best to use hydrosol = rosewater for example instead of regular water. 
    Ana VilaçaSeptember 6, 2017 / 2:04 pm Hi Eve! Finally, I’ve got it! The emulsion is perfect; oils and water remain together thanks to your tips. May I ask you for a toothpaste recipe for my kids? (They are 12 and 10 years old). Thank you very much. Ñamaste Ana 
    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorSeptember 8, 2017 / 4:27 pm I’m so glad Ana!!! For the toothpaste, that’s a great idea, subscribe to my newsletter here https://www.organic-beauty-recipes.com/newsletter_sign_up/ and when I put it online, you will be the first to know:-) 











 grace pittmanJune 16, 2017 / 10:14 pm Hi,I just tried to make the cream I melted bee wax & oils wipped added some water cooled was thick and bees wax was lump Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorJune 17, 2017 / 2:23 am Hi Grace, You need to warm up the rosewater so it gets to the same temperature as the oils and then you mix it with the oils and beeswax and start mixing it so it turns into a cream. Reply 





 ElaineJune 11, 2017 / 2:17 pm Sounds wonderfully easy to make and use. One question: I thought “cold cream” was to cleanse your face, not moisture it Would this formula be good for that, as well as removing makeup? Just wondering if the beeswax would cause problems… Reply

    Eve @ Organic Beauty RecipesAuthorJune 14, 2017 / 12:59 am Hi Elaine, You can use it on your face to remove makeup or also on your eyes as well for removing mascara. Then remove your makeup with cotton pads. Then if you want you can also remove any excess with a clean, soft cotton cloth. The almond oil and beeswax create a natural moisture barrier on the skin. I don’t think beeswax would create problems unless you have super sensitive skin. I suggest you do a test in a small area if you are worried. Reply
