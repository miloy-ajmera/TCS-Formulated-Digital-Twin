Chemistry of Glycerol Monostearate 










Glyceryl Stearates are esterification products of glycerin and stearic acid. Glyceryl Stearate is a white or cream-colored wax-like solid (granular/ powder). Glycerol Monostearate is a compound of one molecule glycerine and one molecule of stearic acid.Synonyms: Glycerol Monostearate, Glyceryle Monostearate, Glycerin Monostearate, Glyceril Stearate, GMS, DGM (Distilled Glycerolmonostearate) 




Applications of Glycerol Monostearate 




Glycerol monostearate is used in food, cosmetics, polymers (resins, plastics, gums) as antistatic agent, antifogging agent, blocking agent, lubricant, dispersant, mold release agent and acid and catalyst neutralizer. 




Use of Glycerol Monostearate in Cosmetics 




In cosmetics and personal care products, Glyceryl Stearate is widely used and can be found in lotions, creams, powders, skin cleansing products, makeup bases and foundations, mascara, eye shadow, eyeliner, hair conditioners and rinses, and suntan and sunscreen products.Glyceryl Stearate acts as a lubricant on the skin’s surface, which gives the skin a soft and smooth appearance. It also slows the loss of water from the skin by forming a barrier on the skin’s surface. Glyceryl Stearate help to form emulsions by reducing the surface tension of the substances to be emulsified. Glycerol Monostearate is some times mixed with small amounts of soap (sodium or potassium stearate) while making emulsions. 











 






















Use of Glycerol Monostearate in Ice cream 




The most common culinary use of GMS (Glycerol monostearate) powder is in ice cream industry. The Method of incorporation is to make a stock mixture of G.M.S. in water And then adding to the ice cream mix.GMS is an additive used as thickening, emulsifying, anti-caking, and preservative agent; an emulsifying agent for oils, waxes, and solvents . GMS and CMC (Carboxy methyl cellulose) are compounds used for stabilizing ice creams. 
















Use of Glycerol Monostearate in baking and cakes 




GMS is used in bakery products like breads and cake preparation. The use of G.M.S. gives loaf a much improved quality at a reduced cost to the baker.G.M.S. give cakes of good volume. G.M.S SE improve all types of cakes. The optimum concentration to be used will depend on the receipt. But in most cases about 3-4% on the weight of flour is adequate They are more tender & keep their freshness longer.GMS is suggested as an emulsifier in producing high quality BiscuitsDue to GMS, fat disperses uniformly in the dough and hence GMS improves the release of the dough from the moulds and cutters to achieve well-shaped biscuits without any distorted edges. It can help to reduce consumption of egg yolk or fat used in making biscuits, thus achieving economy.Use of G.M.S. in the candy preparation, ensures smooth dispersion in flavour oils, improves texture & quality. They are used in chewing gums, margarines and peanut butter as emulsifier. 
















Use of Glycerol Monostearate in baking 




Glyceryl monostearate (GMS) is an effective emulsifier used in the baking industry available in the form of small beads, flakes, or powders. In addition to emulsification, GMS is a thickening agent and a stabilizer. In baking, it is used to improve dough quality and stabilize fat/protein emulsions. GMS also promotes foaming in breads and cakes. 
















Food Safety 




GMS has been approved as a safe ingredient by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), as well as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). FDAGlyceryl monostearate is a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredient when used in food with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice. And also, it is GRAS when used in feed.EFSAGlyceryl monostearate (E471) belongs to Mono- and Diglycerides of fatty acids and listed in Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 as an authorised food additive and categorized in “Additives other than colours and sweeteners”. 

















Performance EnhancerThe versatility of plastics and the tremendous range of products they make possible call for polymer additives that are just as versatile. Glycerol monostearate provide multiple benefits and functionalities, helping to maximize processing efficiencies and making many plastics applications viable. Leading polymer producers, compounders and concentrate manufacturers have come to count on the time- and cost-saving benefits of GMS and other polymer additives. 





How can PATIONIC help?Corbion’s polymer additive solutions help you overcome some of your most challenging manufacturing problems, offering multifaceted capabilities:AntistatAntifogging agentBlocking agentLubricantDispersantMold release agentAcid and catalyst neutralizer 





Antistats, Antifogs, Mold Releaseand LubricantsOur product line is diverse. As the mono content varies, as the double bonds increase or decrease, performance properties arealtered. The chemistry aﬀects solubility, aﬃnity for water, migration in polymers, lubrication properties, volatility, shelf-life,crystallinity, and surfactant activity. Consequently, Corbion oﬀers a wide range of glycerol ester solutions to antistat, antifog,lubrication, dispersion, release, and polymer processing problems. In addition to our standard products, custom solutions can bedeveloped and produced to meet a customer’s speciﬁc requirements. 





Coating Additives for Expandable Polystyrene ParticlesCorbion’s PATIONIC 909 and PATIONIC 919 are commonlyused additives in the production of EPS. These productshave a high chemical purity and are characterized by anarrow particle size distribution (Figures 1 and 2), whichcreates a more stable, continuous and homogeneouscoating layer around the EPS beads.Corbion’s PATIONIC 909/919 additives have antistaticproperties that will reduce agglomeration of EPS beadsduring processing.In addition, these PATIONIC 909/919 additives contribute toreduced cooling times during the molding step and result inan easier release of the foamed part from the mold. Besidesimproved handling and processing, PATIONIC 909/919additives will also contribute to a better appearance andperformance of the foamed product (e.g. for insulation,packaging).

Acid Neutralizers for Increased Molding Rates inPolyoleﬁnsPolypropylene is most often manufactured using ZieglerNattacatalysts. The residues of these catalysts promotecorrosion of metal surfaces and contribute to thedecomposition and discoloration of the polypropylene duringprocessing.Research has shown that PATIONIC 1240 (a calcium lactatebasedadditive) can be used as an acid neutralizer withoutthe negative eﬀects caused by calcium stearate (Figure 3) 





 Reduces processing time Enhances color retention Improves corrosion resistance
