                                This preservative is for products containing over 25% oils and butters. Toners are mostly water so this probably is not the correct preservative to use. You may want to look at the ones that are water-soluble and check the ingredients for each. Some contain parabens which some people prefer to stay away from.

Meaning, is Germaben IIE merely overkill on a lower-oil product, or will it actually be ineffective in such a product?"

                                It is best to use preservatives appropriate for the product. Germaben II, as you know, is for products with at least 25% oils. This also works great in scrubs. It is fine to use in a lotion without milk products or high oil content but it is always important to test any product/preservative for compatibility.

                                Since your product contains no water and is not a product that will be used in the bath or shower, you do not need a preservative. You should use an anti-oxidant such as Vitamin E or ROE (Rosemary Oleoresin) to help keep the oils and butters from going rancid. The Aloe Vera Gel does contain water but has its own preservative added.

                                This preservative is for products using more than 25% oils. We are assuming your body spray is water based and would work well with Preservative-Water Soluble PF. The directions state this should be used at 0.1-0.5%. This can also be used for the face mask.

                                We would recommend using Preservative-Water Soluble PF. The Preservative-Water Soluble/O25 is for products containing over 25% fixed oils/butters. You would need to decide which one works best for your product according to the actual recipe.

                                Preservatives are necessary when incorporating water into a product. I do not believe that adding a preservative will help combat mold or fungus if you intend to use fresh or dried fruit. It would be best to use a fruit scented fragrance oil and botanicals such as orange peel pieces to enhance your product.

                                Germabem II E can be added to a lotion that has more than 25% oils and butter. This will prevent the lotion from spoiling too fast. If your recipe does not contain any water or water based additives and your customers will not be introducing water through use then you do not need a preservative at all. Preservatives such as Germaben II E will not prevent oils and butters from going rancid. You can add an antioxidant such as Vitamin E or Rosemary Oleoresin Extract to extend the shelf life of oils

                                Yes, you can.  But it depends on how much of your lotion will be butters and oils.  This was developed for creams and lotions containing over 25% fixed oils and/or butters.

                                This preservative is recommended for formulas that contain more than 25% oil.  Whether this preservative will work will depend on if any other ingredients will be in your formula.  This product has not been tested in a recipe of only honey and ground oats and, unfortunately, we cannot be sure how it will react if added.

                                Hello,

Yes you would calculate the ewax and stearic acid into your total batch weight. Fixed oils are your base oils that you use in your recipe( also known as carrier oils too).

Thank you for your question

                                Hi, yes the ewax and stearic acid amounts should included when calculating the percentage of the oils portion in your lotion recipe. Fixed oils refer to the oils and butters such as soybean oil or shea butter.

                                Germaben II E is a preservative and preservatives only help inhibit the growth of mold and bacteria when water is introduced to a product.  To extend the shelf-life of an oil, you would need an antioxidant like Vitamin E or Rosemary Oleoresin Extract.

                                Parabens are chemicals used in cosmetics as preservatives. They are popular because of their broad-spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal properties.

COMMENTS:  I used this product because I make my own natural hair products, I use pure Aloe Vera gel in my hair butter and it was causing it to mold and turn rancid. I finally decided to use a preservative after doing a little research and finding that there is no such thing as an "organic" or "natural" preservative. I used this product along with some fragrance oils and I am LOVING the results!! :)

"Does the job"


COMMENTS:  I use this in my oil based scrubs just for that extra protection. I feel you can warn customers about not getting the product in water but there's no guarantee  that they will. Adding this preservative just gives me that peace of mind that my products will stay protected. I'm completely happy with it.
