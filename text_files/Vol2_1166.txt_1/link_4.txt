Toiletries: Antiperspirant Roll-on by Croda
Emulsifiers which are both chemically stable and able to produce a stable emulsion in an acidic environment containing high concentrations of aluminium or zirconium salts, are important in the formulation of roll-on antiperspirant products. A combination of Cithrol GMS A/S, Cromul EM1207 and Volpo S2, which possess chemically stable ether linkages, are used in this formulation to produce a stable emulsion. Crodamol PMP, a linear alkyl methyl-branched ester ether, imparts a non-oily dry emollience.
