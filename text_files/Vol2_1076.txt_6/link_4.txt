          Description
        




At the heart of this transformative regenerative serum is a cocktail of highly effective botanical actives including a powerful plant stem cell complex, vitamins and antioxidant rich ingredients all combined to infuse their reparative nutrients onto the skin in an easily absorbed serum.
Added to this infusion is an effective anti aging active extract, to address fine lines and wrinkles and to increase the effectiveness of this next generation formulation.
Rich in powerful botanical oils, high in essential fatty acids this serum firms and tones the skin, strengthens and repairs the skins barrier function, improves radiance and moisturizes the skin leaving it smooth, radiant and nourished.
Our 3-in-1 Serum does the following:


REGENERATIVE: Pomegranate Oil revitalises the skin, whilst hydrating Sea Buckthorn Oil maintains the skin’s optimum moisture, slowing the visible formation of fine lines and preventing premature skin aging by boosting the moisture renewal process of the skin and increasing radiance.

FIRMING & TONING: With anti-premature ageing benefits Vitamin A rich Sweet Almond Oil supports the skin’s renewal and helps firm and tone the skin. Anti-aging Gatuline protects against fine lines and supports the dermis structure to firm and tighten the skin.

BARRIER REPAIR: Rich in essential fatty acids, Borage Oil boosts the skin’s natural moisture barrier leaving it smooth and radiant. Soline provides extended hydration offering lipid replenishment to soothe and strengthen the skin’s moisture barrier structure.

How to use
