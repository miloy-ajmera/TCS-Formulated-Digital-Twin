}I. Baquerizo, V. Gallardo, +1 author M. RuizPublished 12 July 1999MedicineDrug development and industrial pharmacyWe report the development, design, and results of effectiveness and acceptability testing of a hydrating, nutritive, barrier-type hand cream designed for severely damaged skin (including skin damaged by dermatological problems). We tested different silicone derivatives and a water-in-oil (W/O) silicone emulsifier to produce organoleptic qualities that would increase consumer acceptance of this type of W/O emulsion. Pharmacotechnical and effectiveness tests were done to check the stability and… ExpandView on PubMedhera.ugr.esSave to LibrarySaveCreate AlertAlertCiteShare This Paper5 CitationsView AllFigures and Tables from this papertable 1figure 1table 2figure 2table 3figure 3figure 4figure 5figure 6figure 7figure 8View All 11 Figures & Tables5 CitationsCitation TypeHas PDFAuthorMore FiltersMore FiltersFiltersSort by RelevanceSort by Most Influenced PapersSort by Citation CountSort by RecencyThe efficacy of a protective cream in a real‐world apprentice hairdresser environmentD.
