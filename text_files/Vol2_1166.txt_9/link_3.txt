                            Velvesil Mul-T gel is an excellent starting point to consider for a large variety of multi-claim formulations. Due to its silicone composition, it can deliver a luxurious feel, enhance natural coverage, and minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Velvesil Mul-T gel is able to be quickly and easily combined with additional ingredients, and may be considered for use in a plethora of multi-benefit personal care products. 

This new Mul-T gel is a highly versatile material that combines the potent, translucent soft-focus ability of boron nitride with the powdery, velvety touch of patented Velvesil chemistry. The addition of a spreading agent greatly improves the dispersion of boron nitride within the gel matrix for a more natural-looking, even-tone skin finish. Consumers may instantly discover the soft focus benefit in cosmetic formulations made with this patented technology. By adjusting the base, a variety of new textures can be achieved, ranging from cushioning to creamy, from custard-like to rich and whipped. 

Velvesil Mul-T gel can also be combined with powders, pigments and oils (including fragrance) to create an assortment of visual effects, or with other active ingredients for instant and long-term benefits. view less

                            This newly designed improved sprayable sunscreen formula demonstrates the use of the new volatile silicone Silsoft* ETS trisiloxane in preventing run-down of sunscreen upon application from skin.
