Triethanolamine 99% 
Also known as TEA, Triethanolamine is a widely used amine chemical with many functions. It is used in the manufacturing of many other chemicals - like surfactants, and emulsifiers. It is a common ingredient used in many common consumer, commercial and industrial products.A few primary uses for TEA are for pH buffering in cosmetics, adding stability to emulsified systems,  neutralizing fatty acids, adjusting and solubilizing oils and other ingredients that are not completely soluble in water.Some common places you might find triethanolamine in products are: Lotions, liquid detergents like laundry and dishwashing liquid soaps, shaving creams, general surface cleaners, polishes, metalworking fluids, paints, and printing inks.
Triethanolamine 99% is also used to neutralize formulations including the ingredient Carbopol 940 
THIS IS 99% TRIETHANOLAMINE. It is NOT the LOW FREEZE GRADE. TRIETHANOLAMINE FREEZES SOLID at  70 deg F. To make handling easier, many will gently warm the material (usually in a sink of warm water) and then dilute with 15% water to lower the freeze point.
5 gallon pail 45 pounds +- net weight and ships in our new 5 gallon pail with spout that is resealable and has a convenient back grip for easier pouring.
Material Freezes at 70 deg F. Do not put in microwave. The containers we sell this material in are not suitable for use in hot, high wattage microwave ovens. Most users find that gently warming the material up in warm water works well.  
DRUMS are 510 Pounds NET 
Do you need to transfer triethanolamine from a drum or  a pai? Check out the GoatThroat Pump GT200 with the EPDM seals. Our GoatThroat pumps make transferring and handling liquids easier and safer.

Best price on this chem. I still develop film and TEA is used for developer like 510Pyro. This is 1/2 the price from other suppliers and works great. Fast shipping is a big plus
