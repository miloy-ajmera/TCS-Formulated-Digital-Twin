For barrier disordered skin
Skin care after peeling, laser and shave.
Composition: 

CM-glucan is a polysaccharide, produced from yeast and made water soluble by transformation into its carboxymethyl derivative.

INCI:  

Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Alcohol, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Sorbitol, Sodium Carboxymethyl Betaglucan, Xanthan Gum
Properties: 
CM-glucan shows excellent skin protection and is recommended for barrier disorders. The agent accelerates skin healing and protects skin against bacterial infections. CM-Glucan can be used for sensitive skin, before and after sun. There is a slight photo protection against UV-radiation. Recommended after peeling, after laser treatment, as after shave and as additive for body lotions.
Application: 
Additive for DMS® base creams.
Local skin treatment by applying the pure concentrate.
Remarks
The concentrated active agent should be applied sparingly to the skin similar to dabbing in an ampoule product.
