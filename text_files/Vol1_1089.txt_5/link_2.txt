Glycerin: The Most Frequently Used Cosmetic Ingredient After Water 


                 By Emily Viteritti on 
                
                Jan 27th 2021
            



There’s a reason why glycerin is one of the most-used
cosmetic ingredients. Glycerin is a humectant meaning it absorbs water from the
air or underlying layers of the skin (in other words, it acts as a moisturizer).
According to a 2016 study, glycerin is the most effective humectant compared to hyaluronic
acid, sorbitol, urea, and alpha-hydroxy acids. The beauty industry relies on this ingredient to treat wrinkles,
fine lines, dry patches, and skin infections.What is Glycerin?Glycerin—also
called glycerol and glycerine— is a colorless, odorless, viscous, and
hygroscopic liquid that is non-toxic and non-allergenic. It is made of three
carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and three oxygen atoms, giving it the
formula of C3H8O3. It is also a polyol, an organic compound containing multiple
hydroxyl groups, that acts as an excellent solvent. When glycerin freezes, it
turns into a gummy paste since it is denser than water. It also has a high
boiling point of 554o F (290o C).How is Glycerin Made?Swedish chemist Karl Wilhelm Scheele accidentally discovered
glycerin in 1779 after heating a mixture of lead oxide and olive oil. Today, we
know that plant, animal, and petroleum sources can be used to obtain glycerin. However,
people in the 18th-19th century relied on candles and
soaps containing animal fat—primarily beef tallow—to make glycerin. Modern
animal-derived glycerin no longer contains animal fats (but it is still not
vegan). Glycerin can be vegan if plant-derived. For instance,
glycerin made from plant oils (soy, palm, and coconut oil) is vegan-friendly.
While historically, animal fat was the preferred choice to make soap, it is now
more common to make soap using plant-based oils. LUSH Handmade Cosmetics uses
glycerin derived from rapeseed oil in their soaps, body lotions, and shower
gels.Petroleum is the final source used to make glycerin. It is
also the newest as this artificial type of glycerin was not invented until
1948. This is made in the laboratory with petroleum being the catalyst for a
series of chemical reactions that eventually create synthetic glycerin. Since
natural glycerin is cheaper to manufacture, synthetic glycerin is not often
used.Uses of Glycerin in CosmeticsSince glycerin is a popular humectant, it can be found in an
array of different hair
and skin care products,
including soap, lotion, moisturizer, toner, makeup remover, and leave-in conditioner.Soaps made from glycerin are easily recognizable because they are translucent. Glycerin soap also has a lower pH
than other soaps, which makes it perfect for those with dry, sensitive skin.
The lower pH helps skin retain moisture.Lotions and moisturizers containing glycerin hydrate the
skin making it feel smooth, supple, and healthy. Plus, glycerin is
non-comedogenic, meaning it will not clog pores (making it great for face
application).Glycerin can also be found in toners. The purpose of a toner
is to hydrate and replenish skin, provide essential ingredients, and serve as
additional cleansing. Toners containing glycerin nourish skin.Makeup removers are intended to easily remove makeup that
has been applied. People with sensitive skin can have harsh reactions to some
brands. Removers containing glycerin can quell upset skin and make makeup
removal a breeze.Glycerin can work wonders on hair and acts as a great
leave-in hair conditioner. When it is applied o hair, it draws water from the
air to keep your hair looking shiny and feeling nourished.Benefits of GlycerinGlycerin has a widespread of applications in the cosmetics
industry for a reason. It offers consumers an array of benefits.The main benefit of using glycerin on the skin is its
hydrating ability. This humectant prevents water from evaporating, which keeps
the skin hydrated longer.Lines and wrinkles become less noticeable when glycerin is
applied to the skin. Glycerin provides extra moisture, which provides more
volume. This anti-aging benefit makes glycerin a popular choice among companies.Did you know that glycerin can heal skin? When glycerin is
applied, it helps cells grow faster, which, in turn, speeds up the healing
process. Psoriasis, eczema, and bruising can be counteracted with glycerin.Glycerin also provides an extra layer of protection to the
skin. It increases epidermal layer thickness keeping moisture locked in and
harmful environmental and chemical elements out.Shop our full line of Glycerin, available in 5 gallon pails, 55 gallon drums, and bulk 275 gallon totes.Sources:https://www.aciscience.org/docs/Glycerine_-_an_overview.pdfhttps://www.lushusa.com/article_skin-softening-glycerin.htmlhttps://www.livestrong.com/article/327146-sources-of-glycerine/https://thedermreview.com/glycerin/
