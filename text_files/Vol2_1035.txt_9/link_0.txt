Outcomes of this article: Uses of Cold Cream, Formulation of Cold Cream, Preparation of Cold Cream, Tests of Cold Cream, History and Ideal properties of cold cream.   Before the 1st century, many druggists would compound the rosewater cream and keep it fresh on ice, to make it cold as a skin cream. Cold cream was originally described as the Latin word “refrigeran” meaning “making cold” because when applied, the water evaporates and creates a cooling sensation [1].  You may also read: Difference between Ointment, Cream, Paste, Gel, Lotion, and Jelly. Table of Contents   1What Is Cold CreamUses of cold creamHistory of Cold Cream PreparationFormulation and Preparation of Cold CreamRaw materials and ApparatusFormulation of Cold Cream (Galen’s Cerate Formula for 1000 g) [2]Preparation of Cold CreamFormulation of Cold Cream (BP Formula) [4]Preparation of Cold CreamFormulation of Cold Cream (USP Formula) [5]Preparation of Cold CreamFormulation of Cold Cream (Beeswax-Borax type Traditional Formula)Preparation of Cold CreamFormulation of Cold Cream (Standard Formula)Preparation of cold creamFormulation of Cold Cream (Typical Modern formula) [3]Preparation of Cold CreamList of Best Cold CreamWhy cold cream is called cold cream?Ideal characteristics of cold creamSterility, Storage and Labeling informationCold Cream Test/Evaluation of cold creamReferencesWhat Is Cold CreamCold cream is an emulsion in which the proportion of fatty and oily material predominates, although when it is applied to the skin a cooling effect is produced due to the slow evaporation of the water contained in the emulsion [3]. Cold cream is an example of a Water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion.In cold cream, the major portion is the oil phase. Simply, the cold cream is an oil-based semisolid preparation. Cold cream is also known as Unguentum or Ceratum Refrigerans [2]. Generally, it contains mineral oil, beeswax, borax, and water [1]. It is a soothing and cleansing cosmetic typically of oily and heavy consistency, used to soothe and cleanse the skin. It can be classified as a form of cleansing cream. Cream vs Ointment According to European Pharmacopoeia, cold cream is known as Fatty Cream.Uses of cold creamUses of cold cream depend on the ingredients of a cream which means functional ingredients define the uses of cold cream. The main uses of cold cream are as follows:  Medicated cold cream is mainly used as a topical pharmaceutical dosage form for the treatment of skin.Helps to maintain the skin’s moisture balance and avoid rough skin conditions. It is one of the primary uses of cold cream (non-medicated).As cleansing preparation to remove make-up.To provide an emollient effect.To provide an oily protective layer on the skin.Also, provide a chemical barrier as with sunblock ingredients. As a carrier for drug substances such as diflucortolone valerate in medicated cream.To remove oil-soluble impurities from the skin. Uses of cold cream are less than vanishing cream (oil in water emulsion) as topical pharmaceutical dosage form.History of Cold Cream PreparationCold cream was first invented by Galen, a famous Greek physician-pharmacist in the Roman Empire (who practiced in Rome) of the 1st Century AD. The Galen formula of cold cream has changed but little in proportions or method of preparation throughout many centuries [1].Formulation and Preparation of Cold CreamRaw materials and ApparatusRaw materials as per formula. Cold creams may be formulated with oils, both or either mineral oil and vegetable oil, as well as fatty alcohols, fatty acids, and fatty esters, emulsifying agents, preservatives, and purified water. There should be four main ingredients as follow: OilWaterEmulsifierThickening agentApparatus required laboratory-scale production as follows: Measuring Cylinder,Beaker,Stirrer/ Glass rod,Thermometer,Water bath.Formulation of Cold Cream (Galen’s Cerate Formula for 1000 g) [2]Name of Raw materialsQuantityFunctionCetyl Esters Wax125.00 gStiffening agent and EmollientWhite Wax/ White Beeswax120.00 gStiffening agentAlmond Oil560.00 gEmollientSodium Borate USP-NF/Borax BP5.00 gEmulsifying agentStronger Rose Water25.00 mlFlavoring agentRose Oil0.20 mlFlavoring agentPurified Water q.s. to1000.00 gVehicle and SolventPreparation of Cold CreamThe general preparation method is, to prepare an oil and aqueous phase separately and then mix, after mixing add fragrance or other ingredients, then homogenize and congeal.Preparation of oil phase: Melt together Cetyl esters wax, almond oil, and white wax in a beaker with continuous heating at 70°C-80°C.Preparation of aqueous phase: Dissolve the sodium borate in the purified water and stronger rose water warmth to 70°-80°C. Then slowly add the warm aqueous phase to the oil phase, with continuous stirring until it has cooled to about 45°C. Then add the rose oil, and finally, homogenize for 30 minutes and congeal this cream.Formulation of Cold Cream (BP Formula) [4]As a pharmaceutical preparation, cold cream was included in the issue of The British Pharmaceutical Codex in 1949, as an ointment of rose water.Name of Raw materialsQuantityFunctionAlmond oil610.00 mlEmollient,  Solvent and vehicles of an oil phaseWhite beeswax180.00 gStiffening agentBorax10.00 gEmulsifying agentRosewater199.00 mlVehicle and Solvent of an aqueous phaseOil of rose1.00 mlFlavoring agentPreparation of Cold CreamMelt the beeswax and almond oil at 75-80°C together.

Besides, in cold cream, the major portion is the oil phase thus cold cream is used especially in cold temperatures or the winter season. On the other hand, vanishing cream is used for summer or hot environments because vanishing cream contains a large portion of the aqueous phase.Ideal characteristics of cold cream It should not normally be diluted.The pH of the cold cream must be optimum from 4.6–6.0Its consistency should be optimum so that it can be easily put out from the container and apply easily.Should give a cooling effect on the skin after external application.It must provide a thin waxy protective layer on the skin to protect the water evaporation from the skin surface.Should give a faster emollient effect, so that very dry skin can swell up and become soft within a short time.Less greasy than ointment.Generally, creams are white to off-white color but may have different colors such as yellow (Nystatin Cream USP).Easily spread on the skin.Free from gritty particles.It should be nontoxic and nonirritant.Attractive in appearance.It should be physically and chemically stable throughout its shelf life.The excipients should be compatible with each other.It should be more easily washed off using water.Should be sterile. If any microbial growth is found then stop the use of cold cream.Sterility, Storage and Labeling informationIt should be sterile, it complies with the test for sterility.Storage It should not be permitted to freeze.Labeling informationThe label information should contain: Manufacture and expiration dateConditions under which it should be stored,Where applicable,Name of any added antimicrobial preservative.To clear your concept you should know first about Definition and Classification of Cream. Ancient uses of cold cream were to get a cooling sensation. If you know of any other uses of Cold Cream, feel free and drop comments in the comments box.
