Cracked heels indicate you haven   t been caring enough for your feet. The rough weather during winters makes things worse. You don   t need regular pedicures or spa appointments to fix this problem. A few basic home remedies for cracked heels and following them religiously will ensure you don   t spend big bucks in treating dry and cracked feet. Beauty expert Aashmeen Munjal, Owner, Star Salon    n    Spa, New Delhi tells you how a simple ingredient like glycerin can help you care for your feet during winter:
How glycerin helpsGlycerin is a humectant. It has the ability to lock in moisture in your skin and help retain it for long. It is a popular moisturiser. The first step before you apply glycerin is to dip your feet in lukewarm water mixed with soap or hydrogen peroxide to get rid of all the dirt from your feet. Use a loofah or pumice stone to get rid of the dead skin. Pat dry and then use glycerin. You can also try these dermatologist recommended creams for cracked heels.
