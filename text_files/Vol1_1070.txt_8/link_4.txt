What Is Glycerin?
Glycerin is a non-toxic, odorless and colorless alcoholic liquid usually found in animal fats and vegetable oils. A natural humectant or a skin-conditioner, glycerin keeps your skin hydrated, soft and supple. It also protects your skin from harmful environmental aggressors, while improving its texture.
Glycerin also treats several skin disorders, ranging from dry skin to wound healing. The ingredient has the potential of improving your overall internal health as well.
Benefits Of Using Glycerin On Face
According to Dr. Kaustav Guha, Head of R&D and Lead Scientist at SkinKraft Laboratories, “Glycerin is a highly effective humectant that keeps your skin hydrated for a long duration. It is non-comedogenic, non-allergenic, affordable and naturally derived from mostly plant sources. Thus, you will find it in products formulated for babies, aged, dry, oily as well as sensitive skin.”
Some of the benefits that glycerine offers for your skin are:
1. Moisturizes Skin
Using glycerin can improve the skin’s moisture levels (1). It attracts moisture from the environment and traps it in your skin to make it appear healthy, soft and hydrated. (2)
2. Protects And Heals
Glycerin protects the skin against irritants and external pollutants. It also helps in in increasing cell turnover that plays a key role in the healing of wounds. (3)
3. Has Anti-Aging Properties
Glycerin can slow down the ageing process of your skin and keep it firm and wrinkle-free for a longer period. (4)
4. Can Treat Eczema And Atopic Dermatitis
Glycerin’s moisturizing and hydrating properties help soothe dry skin. Research indicates that creams containing glycerin can treat eczema and atopic dermatitis. (5)
5. Repairs Skin Barrier
Glycerin, when used with hyaluronic acid, functions as a skin barrier repairing and protecting agent.
6. Creates A Calming Effect On Skin
If you have sensitive skin, plant-based glycerine can be the ideal choice. It is gentle on sensitive skin and helps reduce temporary skin discomfort.
7. Prevents Acne
Other than the potent moisturizing and hydrating properties, glycerin is oil-free and non-comedogenic too. This is why it is an excellent moisturizer for oily and acne-prone skin. It helps to prevent clogged pores besides soothing existing acne to prevent it from spreading further.
8. Forms A Protective Layer
One of the most amazing benefits of using glycerine on the face is that it helps to thicken the epidermal layer of your skin by forming a protective layer. This helps to prevent loss of moisture and shield it against harmful environmental elements.
9. Acts As A De-Tan Solution
Glycerin acts as a barrier against harmful sun rays and environmental pollutants, hence can be used as a mild sunscreen. If you already have a tan, you may use glycerin to restore your initial skin tone. Glycerine works by removing impurities clogged in the pores and lightening your skin tone.
10. Removes Dead Skin
Glycerin removes dead skin cells from the skin by breaking down the proteins in them. This way it helps in new skin cells generation, thus, giving you clear and healthy skin.

Glycerin can help you get rid of cracked and chapped lips, especially during the winter months. It's far gentler on the skin when compared to chemical-laden lip balms.

Can You Apply Glycerin Directly On Your Face?
According to scientific research, glycerin is absolutely safe to use on the face. It is widely used in several facial creams and cleansers. However, glycerin easily attracts and absorbs moisture, dust and pollution, which can cause irritation to some people. Thus, you should ideally dilute raw glycerin in water or rose water before applying it on your face.

 Note:
Always remember to conduct a patch test and talk to your dermatologist before using any new product on your face.

How To Apply Glycerin To Your Face?

 As a toner

Precautions And Tips Of Using Glycerin On Your Skin

Although glycerin is gentle on the skin, it is advised to conduct a patch test before applying it to your face. Dilute glycerin in rose water and apply the mixture to the back of your hand. Wait for 24 hours. If your skin doesn’t experience any allergic reactions, it’s safe to be applied onto your face.
If you have sensitive skin, make sure to not use glycerin directly on your skin. Always dilute it.
Glycerin can cause sun sensitivity. It is advised for you to use glycerin at night before sleeping. If you do use it during the day, apply sunscreen before you step out.


 Did You Know? 
Glycerin can help you get rid of cracked and chapped lips, especially during the winter months. It's far gentler on the skin when compared to chemical-laden lip balms.

Can You Leave Glycerin Overnight On Your Face?
Glycerin is a humectant. It attracts moisture from the environment and the inner layers of your skin. Using it overnight for months together can also dry up the inner layers of your skin and eventually result in skin aging.
Leaving it on for 15-20 minutes and washing it off before going to bed is the best option. However, if you are leaving it overnight, make sure it is diluted properly.
Does Glycerin Have Any Side Effects On Skin?
Several research studies have proved glycerin to be a safe ingredient for all skin types. However, it can cause allergic reactions, if not diluted well. Too much glycerin can lead to excess hydration in oily skin and water-loss in dry skin. So, use it with caution. (6)
 Wrapping Up 
Glycerin is a gentle ingredient used in most cosmetics, including baby products. It is used to treat many skin issues and is known for its hydrating and moisturizing properties. But, it is always advisable to conduct a patch test before you apply it on your face. Your skin type plays a major role in determining how your skin will react to a particular ingredient.
