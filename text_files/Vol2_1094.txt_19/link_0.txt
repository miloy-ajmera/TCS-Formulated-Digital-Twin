What is STEARIC ACID used for?

Stearic acid is used to thicken the products and bind the ingredients together. It has moisturizing and anti-inflammatory properties that make this ingredient a very popular choice in cosmetic and skincare products.

Skin care: It helps keep the skin soft and moisturized. It also binds the ingredients and keeps them from separating. Stearic acid can be found in a range of skincare and personal care products like moisturizers, sunscreens, baby lotions, etc.
Hair care: It is a great emulsifying agent and a good conditioner for the hair. This ingredient coats the hair well, acting as a barrier against the harmful elements in the environment. Moreover, stearic acid is a light ingredient and does not weigh the hair down
Cosmetic products: It is known to improve the texture of the products and help them spread more evenly. This ingredient acts as a great skin barrier and protects the skin while keeping the moisture locked in




Origin

Stearic acid is obtained by the hydrolysis of common vegetable and animal oils and fats. The resulting fatty acids then undergo crystallization or distillation. There are certain pressing methods that are used to separate the solid saturated fatty acids from the liquid unsaturated fatty acids. Cosmetic-grade Stearic acids are generally pressed two or three times to obtain different concentrations.
