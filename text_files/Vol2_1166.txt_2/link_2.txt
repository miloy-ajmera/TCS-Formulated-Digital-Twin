Description
Tips for Serving and Storing Your Cake: A towering triumph of fresh coconut and vanilla, the show-stopping Ultimate Coconut Cake tastes best when served at room temperature! Before serving, remove the cake from your refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature: typically four – six hours. The Ultimate Coconut Cake will remain fresh for one week when refrigerated, or you may store it in the freezer for up to four months. Enjoy!
Shipping: All Ultimate Coconut Cakes are shipped via FedEx. Shipping charges are based on total shipping weight and destination zip code. All cakes are shipped via overnight shipping to destinations within the continental United States. Cakes destined for Alaska or Hawaii are shipped by 2-day shipping. Next-day deliveries must be placed before 2:00 pm EST. Click here to view full shipping chart.
Please note: All sales are final.

“This romantic restaurant is as beautiful inside as it is outside, with palmetto-lined, shaded outdoor courtyard dining and flickering lantern lighting. Peninsula Grill is an ideal date night destination, even if you’ve already dined elsewhere in the area and are looking only for dessert.
The famous Ultimate Coconut Cake is certainly Peninsula Grill’s most popular menu item, dessert or otherwise, and it is certainly worth the hype (and worth ordering). The 12-layer Ultimate Coconut Cake is so well loved that it carries its own trademark, and is even available for online ordering.”
— USA Today
 



Good Morning America hosts Lara Spencer and Amy Robach both pick Charleston, S.C., as their “Favorite Place in America” with Lara saying that “No meal is complete” without the Peninsula Grill Ultimate Coconut Cake. Click Here to view the tv clip.

4. Problems beyond our control.
5. Cakes which have become unusable due to failure to follow instructions marked on the packaging by the recipient.
6. We cannot ship to P.O. Boxes, APO or FPO addresses. Shipping addresses with a PO Box will cause a delay until we can obtain a correct shipping address.
