                        Description
                    








INCI: Glyceryl Citrate, Lactate, Linoleate, Oleate

It is a O/W emulsifier for cold-use or it can be used in hot fat phase with a hot part of (hot) water phase. After both are emulsifying then add the cold water phase. Emulwitor 375 is made of European sunflower oil, and of lactic and citric acid of vegetable origin of Germany. It reacts best in the pH area of 4,5-10. Emulwitor 375 is only partially anionic and therefore suitable as co-emulsifier for cationic emulsifiers.
