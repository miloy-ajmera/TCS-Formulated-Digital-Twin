Common Name
IMWITOR 375
INCI Name
Glyceryl Citrate/Lactate/Linoleate/Oleate
Extraction
IMWITOR 375 is a 100% natural, sunflower based liquid O/W emulsifier. The molecular structure is similar to lecithin. It is cold processable and especially interesting for light emulsions with a soft, velvety touch as well as for gel creams, nail lacquer remover and  self-emulsifying bath oils. IMWITOR375 builds liposomes in water. The skin feel is long-lasting and rich but non-sticky. Imwitor 375 is both Ecocert and COSMOS approved.
Origin
Germany
Characteristics
Imwitor 375 was our first attempt at sourcing a Palm Free Emulsifier. We have added more Palm Free options to this website but Imwitor 375 remains one of the most cost effective Palm Free emulsifiers we currently offer. It is produced from Central European Sunflower Oil and Sugar Beet Root so in addition to being vegetable derived, it is primarily a Palm Free emulsifier. Imwitor 375 functions in the pH range of 4.5 - 10.0 and can emulsify oil up to 35%.
Properties

100% Natural
Recommended dosage: 0.5 - 3.0%
Food approved O/W emulsifier
