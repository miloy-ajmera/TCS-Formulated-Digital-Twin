Sunflower Oil for Skin: 10 Benefits, How to Use

        May 13, 2020
      



Newsflash: sunflowers are more than just the gorgeous yellow blooms that make a great bouquet. These large, lovely flowers create nutrient-dense seeds whose oil has an array of different uses in skin care.
Sunflower oil has been used as a natural skin care ingredient for hundreds of years all over the world, and it boasts a plethora of benefits. It encourages younger looking skin, boosts nourishment, and protects skin against the elements.
In this post, we’ll cover 10 reasons to use sunflower oil, how sunflower oil is made, how to use sunflower oil in your skin care routine, what skin types it’s good for, and many other frequently asked questions.

IN A NUTSHELL

Ingredient Category: Oil/emollient.
Main Benefits: Sunflower oil hydrates and repairs the skin barrier, working to smooth and soothe skin and protect it from environmental stressors.
Find It In: So Clean! Facial Cleanser, H2 Oh Yeah Hydrating Moisturizer, Crème de la Cream Brightening Moisturizer, Youth Fairy Retinol Moisturizer, and Eyes Eyes Baby Anti-Aging Eye Cream.





GET THAT GLOW
Looking for a moisturizer rich in sunflower oil? We've got you.

How is Sunflower Oil Made?
Sunflower oil is made from pressing the seeds of the Helianthus annuus flowers, also known as sunflowers.
They can be pressed through the use of chemical solvents, or they can be cold-pressed at lower temperatures without the use of any chemicals.
When purchasing sunflower oil for skin care, always look for organic cold-pressed oil.


10 Reasons to Use Sunflower Oil
1. It hydrates.
Like the skin’s own natural oil, or sebum, sunflower oil is an emollient, meaning it adds hydration and smooths. That makes it a perfect moisturizer as it helps skin to retain water.
2. It’s rich in antioxidants.
Sunflower oil is rich in vitamin E, a protective antioxidant. It also contains vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin K and vitamin D, which help to protect from environmental stressors that can cause premature aging.
3. It helps to unclog pores.
This smooth, nourishing oil is non-comedogenic, meaning it won’t clog pores. Sunflower oil can actually help to decongest pores by clearing them of dead skin cells and creating a refreshed, revitalized appearance.
4. It can minimize signs of aging.
With protective antioxidants and its ability to retain moisture, sunflower oil can help minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles. It can also help protect your skin against further damage.
5. It’s soothing.
Sunflower oil is known for its ability to soothe irritated skin. It works for all skin types and provides gentle moisture and protection.
6. It can help calm temporary redness.
Sunflower oil can actually alleviate temporary redness in sensitive or dry skin.
7. It protects skin.
Sunflower oil provides a protective barrier against environmental stressors, helping your skin stay clean and free from dirt and toxins.
8. It can help even out skin tone and texture.
Easily absorbed into skin, sunflower oil can even out the look of your skin’s surface and even temporarily shrink the appearance of pores.
9. It’s a natural botanical ingredient.
All good things grow in the garden! Sunflower oil has been around for thousands of years and is free from nasty chemicals or toxins.
10. It’s gentle.
For those with sensitive or mature skin, sunflower oil is ideal as it is gentle on the skin and has calming properties.


How to Use Sunflower Oil in Your Skin Care Routine
The best way to use sunflower oil for skin is to look for it as an ingredient in the clean skincare products you purchase. In this way, you’ll reap its benefits along with those of any other ingredients designed for your specific skin care needs. All Fleur & Bee moisturizers contain sunflower seed oil for skin as a key ingredient. Our So Clean! facial cleanser also includes sunflower oil to help remove impurities.

You can also use sunflower oil in its pure form to pre-cleanse your skin and to moisturize your skin.
To use sunflower seed oil as a pre-cleanser, place a few drops between your fingers, then spread it all over your face. Wipe it off with a damp cloth and follow up with a regular cleanser. You can also use it to remove makeup by applying it to a cotton ball and wiping away makeup at the end of the day.
To use sunflower oil as a moisturizer, follow these steps:

Cleanse your skin with a natural face wash.
Spritz on toner.
Apply serum all over your face and neck.
Take a few drops of sunflower oil and rub it between your hands. Spread it all over your face and neck, avoiding the eye area.
Gently apply eye cream around the eye area.
Apply sunscreen (in the a.m.).

The best type of sunflower oil for skin skin is organic, cold-pressed sunflower oil, as it’s the least processed option, allowing it to retain most nutrients. We recommend Pura D'Or organic sunflower seed oil.

What Skin Type Is it Good For?
Sunflower oil is good for dry skin, sensitive skin, combination skin, oily skin, and mature skin. 

For dry skin: sunflower oil helps provide moisture and allows skin to retain water.
For sensitive skin: sunflower oil provides gentle moisture, protection, and a soothing feel.
For combination skin: sunflower oil helps both provide moisture and balance oils in the areas that need it.
For oily skin: while it may seem counterintuitive to use an oil on oily skin, sunflower is non-comedogenic and doesn’t clog pores and helps to balance natural oils.
For mature skin: sunflower oil adds hydration and minimizes the look of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as protecting against future damage.

Other Frequently Asked Questions About Sunflower Oil and Skin Care
Is sunflower oil bad for your skin?
No, the benefits of sunflower oil for skin are numerous. It can help fight signs of aging, moisturize, soothe temporary redness and provide antioxidant support.
Which sunflower oil is best for skin?
Organic, cold-pressed (or expeller pressed) sunflower oil is best for skin. Avoid sunflower oil that’s been chemically processed.
Can I use sunflower oil as a moisturizer?
Yes, you can use sunflower oil as a moisturizer. Simply apply a few drops to your clean face and allow it to absorb.


Can you use sunflower oil on your face?
Yes, you can use sunflower oil on your face as a moisturizer or pre-cleanser/makeup remover. As a moisturizer, simply apply to clean skin and allow it to absorb. To pre-cleanse, apply the oil all over your face, then wipe clean with a damp cloth. Follow up with your favorite face wash.
What does sunflower oil do for your skin?
Sunflower oil is no less than a miracle ingredient! It is able to hydrate, unclog pores, minimize signs of aging, and even out skin tone. It’s also full of antioxidants like vitamin E, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin K, and vitamin D, which means sunflower oil can protect your skin from environmental stressors that threaten to harm it. It also minimizes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while soothing the skin.
Sunflower oil vs safflower oil
Sunflower oil and safflower oil come from two different but related plants. Sunflower oil comes from the yellow blooms known as sunflowers, while safflower oil comes from a similar plant with yellow and orange petals.
