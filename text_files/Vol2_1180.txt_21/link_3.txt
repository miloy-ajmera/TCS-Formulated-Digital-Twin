Beauty Tips



· For a natural look with added luminosity, reapply a small amount onto the cheekbones and the bridge of the nose with light touches.
· Before a special event, apply this cream underneath make-up to instantly erase signs of fatigue.
· For a more even and natural coverage, this eye cream can be used as a concealer substitute.







Step 1
Apply by pressing onto three points on the upper eyelid, followed by three more on the lower eyelid: to activate microcirculation, and reduce the appearance of puffiness and dark circles.



Step 2
Extend over the eye contour area using outward movements to achieve better coverage.



Step 3
Reapply as many times as you like to keep eyes looking fresh and rested all day long.
