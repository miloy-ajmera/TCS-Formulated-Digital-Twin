        Good coverage
I have used this cover cream for several years to cover scars from an accident. It goes on very smooth and blends well.

        Good cream foundation
I liked this product better than the Dermablend liquid foundation.  I thought it looked nice all day and was easy to apply.  I'm not sure I liked it enough to purchase again mostly because of the price and I have found less expensive products that work well, too.
