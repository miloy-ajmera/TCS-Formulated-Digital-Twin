Dimethicone


















Dimethicone









Dimethicone is a silicone-based polymer that is frequently used as a skin protectant in skincare products. The second most common moisturizing ingredient found in moisturizers after petrolatum, dimethicone helps condition the skin—improving its softness and flexibility.











Important Things to Know about Dimethicone 




Dimethicone contributes to the "slip" or "glide" felt upon the application of skincare products, making them spread easily onto the skin. In addition, dimethicone coats the skin, helping to moisturize it by reducing water loss and providing the skin with softness and coverage—without feeling heavy.





Gentle and non-comedogenic (when applied to clean skin), dimethicone is an effective moisturizing ingredient for all skin types. As a skin protectant at certain levels, dimethicone is especially useful for those whose skin needs an additional barrier that helps prevent moisture from escaping. Dry, itchy and rough skin may benefit from skincare products that contain dimethicone.





Dimethicone can be found in ointments, creams, lotions, serums, sunscreens and lip balms. To reap its moisturizing and skin-protectant benefits, use these products as directed.





Dimethicone forms a barrier on the skin that helps minimizes water loss. Dimethicone also helps improve the skin’s smoothness and flexibility by filling gaps between the cells in the uppermost layer of your skin.





Dimethicone is a gentle, effective moisturizing ingredient for both the face and body. It helps provide long-lasting skin-smoothing benefits, and is ideal for areas prone to rough, dry skin such as knees, elbows, hands and feet, and can help with certain skin conditions like eczema.
