            Specialty Emollients In Bulk Size
        

MakingCosmetics Inc. has access to hundreds of bulk ingredients. These ingredients usually come in sizes between 40-55lbs (18-25kg) depending upon the product. Typical lead times range from 10-14 business days. Sometimes much longer lead times may occur due to manufacturing delays and raw material shortages. Due to these uncontrollable market forces, available sizes, prices and lead times are subject to change without notice. All special order bulk items are non-refundable and non-returnable after the order has been confirmed via email. Upon special request, we can also source bulk ingredients that are not listed on our website. Please use the Contact Us form to make a request.
