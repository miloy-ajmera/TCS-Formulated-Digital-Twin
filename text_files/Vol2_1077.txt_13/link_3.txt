Description
Cetiol® OE is based on 100% natural feedstocks. It is a fast spreading emollient that is approved by both Ecocert and NPA. It gives the skin a light, silky feel and is ideal for innovative green formulations without silicones. Cetiol® OE is hydrolysis stable and suitable for formulations with a wide pH range.

Stable emulsions even under extreme pH
Make-up removal efficacy
Reduced whitening effects of AP/ Deo Stick
High spreading properties make it ideal for depilatory lotions.
