XIAMETER® PMX-200 Silicone Fluid 1000 cSt by Dow Corning acts as a protecting and de-soaping agent. It is a polydimethylsiloxane fluid and is tasteless, odorless and non-toxic. It imparts soft & velvety skin feel and spreads easily on both skin & hair. It provides ease of application, greater depth of gloss and prevents foaming during rubout. Moreover, it offers ease of buffering, color enhancement, high water repellency, high compressibility and high shearability without breakdown. It exhibits high spreadability, compatibility, low environmental & fire hazard, low reactivity & vapour pressure, good heat stability and low surface energy. XIAMETER® PMX-200 Silicone Fluid 1000 cSt finds application in formulating hand creams and lotions to form an effective barrier and a more uniform film.
