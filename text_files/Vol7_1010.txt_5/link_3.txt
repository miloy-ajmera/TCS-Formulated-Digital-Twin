Sellers, BS Pharmacy, PharmD — By Mary West  on February 10, 2022What it isProductsBenefitsSafetySide effects and risksOther alcoholsEnvironmental impactSummaryCetearyl alcohol is a type of fatty alcohol that companies use to make various cosmetic products. These include a wide array of toiletries, including hand creams, shampoos, and body washes.This alcohol is an emollient, which means it softens the skin and hair. Manufacturers also use it to stabilize emulsions, which are mixes of oil and water.Cetearyl alcohol is different from the alcohol in drinks, which is known as ethanol. While ethanol is drying to the skin, fatty alcohols are not. Experts widely accept cetearyl alcohol as a safe ingredient in cosmetics, and it is practically nontoxic, although some people can be sensitive or allergic to it.This article discusses cetearyl alcohol and the products that contain it, as well as its benefits and side effects. It also examines other alcohols in cosmetics.What is cetearyl alcohol?Share on PinterestIryna Veklich/Getty ImagesTechnical-grade cetearyl alcohol is a mixture of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol. Both alcohols are present in small amounts in plants and animals. Cetearyl, cetyl, and stearyl alcohol are all fatty alcohols, which means they derive from natural oils and fats. Cetearyl alcohol is a waxy, white solid that manufacturers typically sell in the form of flakes. While it is soluble (dissolves) in oils and alcohols, it is insoluble in water.Other names for this ingredient include:cetostearyl alcoholcetyl/stearyl alcohol1-octadecanol mixed with 1-hexadecanolProducts that can contain cetearyl alcoholCetearyl alcohol is an ingredient in many products, such as:moisturizing creams and lotionsshampooconditionersexfoliantssunscreenshair sprayshair dyeshair moussefacial cleansersmakeup, including foundations, lipstick, and mascarashaving creamsbody washes and bar soapsbaby wipesantiperspirants and deodorantstoothpastenail treatmenthand sanitizerbody oilmouthwashfragranceglitterWhat does cetearyl alcohol do in skin and hair care?Cetearyl alcohol has emollient properties, which means it softens and smooths the skin and hair. Manufacturers also use this ingredient to alter the texture and performance of their formulas. They may add it to products to:create an emulsion, which is a blend of oils and waterstabilize foamsincrease foaming capacitychange the thickness of liquidsIs cetearyl alcohol safe for humans?Cetearyl alcohol is practically nontoxic, according to PubChem. An older 1988 safety assessment found it is safe as a cosmetic ingredient.Side effects and risksCetearyl alcohol poses little to no risk to humans as long as someone uses products containing it as instructed on the label.An older 1997 study noted that emulsifiers rarely cause allergic dermatitis, but cited five known cases. All of the people who had allergic reactions had preexisting allergies to other substances.People who do have an allergy to cetearyl alcohol may develop a rash known as allergic contact dermatitis, which is a type of eczema.Other alcohols in cosmeticsThe National Rosacea Society states that in addition to cetearyl alcohol, cosmetics and personal care products may contain other fatty alcohols, such as:cetyl alcoholsteryl alcohollauryl alcoholAll of these are safe. They help prevent water loss from the outer layer of the skin and give products a creamier consistency.However, some cosmetics contain astringent alcohols. These are alcohols that can dry and irritate the skin, particularly if someone has sensitive skin.Ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, is a type of astringent alcohol. This is the alcohol in alcoholic drinks, and is also in some cosmetic products. Manufacturers sometimes use it because it makes liquids dry faster, or to preserve ingredients and prevent them from spoiling.To prevent people from using cosmetics containing ethanol as an alcoholic beverage, the cosmetic may contain a denaturant, which is a substance that makes the alcohol undrinkable. In a product’s list of ingredients, this is called SD alcohol, which stands for specially denatured. A person may find ethanol listed on a product label under the following names:alcoholethanoldenatured alcoholalcohol denatSD alcoholAccording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), products that do not contain ethanol may have “alcohol free” on the label. This label does not apply to fatty alcohols, such as cetearyl, cetyl, or stearyl alcohol.Other astringent alcohols that may be in cosmetics include:isopropyl alcoholmethanolbenzyl alcoholEnvironmental impactCetearyl alcohol is biodegradable, according to SAAPedia. However, the Environmental Working Group states that it is a suspected environmental toxin.More research is necessary to determine if using cetearyl alcohol in products could have an adverse effect on the environment.SummaryCetearyl alcohol is a fatty alcohol that can soften the skin and hair. It also stabilizes products that contain a mixture of oil and water, and changes the thickness of liquids. Because of these properties, it is a popular ingredient in many cosmetics and toiletries.While cetearyl alcohol and other fatty alcohols in cosmetics do not dry the skin, ethanol and other astringent alcohols do. People with dry, sensitive skin may wish to look for products with “alcohol free” on the label to avoid the irritating effects of astringent alcohols.
