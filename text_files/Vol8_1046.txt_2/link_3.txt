Preface 


More than 1900 cosmetic and toiletry formulations are detailed in this volume, 
based on information received from numerous industrial companies and other 
organizations. This is Volume 2 of the Second Edition of this work; Volume 1 
was published in 1989. The formulations in Volume 2 do not duplicate any of 
those in Volume 1. 

The data represent selections from manufacturers’ descriptions made at no cost 
to, nor influence from, the makers or distributors of these materials. Only the 
most recent formulas have been included. It is believed that all of the 
trademarked raw materials listed are currently available, which will be of interest 
to readers concerned with raw material discontinuances. 

The 1989 market for cosmetic and toiletry raw materials was $1.6 billion. That 
market is projected to increase to about $1.8 billion by 1994, thus making the 
information in the book particularly interesting to anyone considering new 
products or process variations. 

Each formulation in the book is identified by a description of end use. The 
formulations include the following as available, in the manufacturer’s own words: 
a listing of each raw material contained; the percent by weight of each raw 
material; suggested formulation procedure; and the formula source, which is the 
company or organization that supplied the formuia.The book is divided into the 


following 

15 sections: 

I. 

Antiperspirants and Deodorants 

II. 

Baby Products 

III. 

Bath and Shower Products 

IV. 

Beauty Aids 

V. 

Creams 

VI.

v 



vi Preface 


Each formula is indexed in the section which is most applicable. The reader 
seeking a formula for a specific end use should check each section which 
could possibly apply. 

In addition to the above, there are two other sections that will be helpful to 
the reader: 

XVI. Trade-Named and Other Raw Materials Descriptions. 

Each raw material is listed with a brief chemical 
description and the name of the raw material supplier. 

XVII. Suppliers’ Addresses. Addresses of suppliers of trade- 
named raw materials and/or formulations, some of 
which are not available in the usual reference books. 

It should be noted that some formulations in the book are translations. The 
manufacturer’s exact wording has been used in these cases. Occasionally 
different companies have listed the same raw material differently; it is hoped 
that the reader will be able to identify the same or similar raw materials by 
consulting the Trade-Named and Other Raw Materials Descriptions section. 

The table of contents of the book is organized in such a way as to serve as a 
subject index. 

My fullest appreciation is expressed to the companies and organizations which 
supplied the information included in this book. 

March, 1992 Ernest W. Flick

oxy Dimethicone contributes both to gloss and to the creamy tex¬ 
ture. The C24-28 Alkyl Dimethicone contributes gloss and struct¬ 
ure to the stick. The Isostearyl Isononanoate provides slip and 
emolliency.

Procedure: 

1. Heat Phase I and Phase II separately to 80C with propeller 
mixing until all chemicals are dissolved and uniform. 

2. At 80C while propeller mixing, add Phase II to Phase I, w/o. 

3. Continue mixing while cooling slowly to 50C. Adjust mixing to 
50C due to viscosity change (thickening occurs). 

4. At 50C add Phase III while mixing. Once uniform, add Phase IV 
with mixing. 

5. Continue to adjust mixing as needed. Force cool, if needed, 
until emulsion reaches 32C. The product will look somewhat 
unstable at this stage. Inversion will occur at 32C and the 
cream will become very smooth and white. Continue to force 
cool to room temperature.

Disperse QUATRISOFT POLYMER LM-200 in water at room tempera¬ 
ture with good agitation. When thoroughly dispersed, heat to 
75C until uniform. Mix phase B separately until uniform at room 
temperature. Add phase A to phase B, minus triethanolamine with 
mixing. When thoroughly mixed, add the triethanolamine with 
mixing until gel-like. Heat AB and phase C to 75C. Add phase C 
to AB. Heat phase D to 75C and add to ABC. Cool to room tempera¬ 
ture with mixing. 

Description: 

Soft, white, glossy cream for use on dry skin. QUATRISOFT 
POLYMER LM-200 (cationic cellulosic polymer) is substantive 
to the skin, imparting a smooth, silky afterfeel. The nonionic 
emulsifying pair of GLUCATE SS (w/o) and GLUCAMATE SSE-20 (o/w) 
produces a stable emulsion over a wide temperature range. AMER- 
CHOL L-101 acts as a w/o stabilizer in this o/w cream, and along 
with MODULAN, also provides emolliency.

Procedure: 

Weigh 1-8 and heat to 85C with slow agitation. The blend has 
a cloud point of approximately 80C. Above the cloud point all 
waxes will eventually dissolve in the blend. If a higher solv¬ 
ating temperature is used, solvation can be much faster. Hold 
the wax blend at 85C. Heat 9-13 to 85-90C and stir gently until 
all has dissolved. Hold at 85C. 

Place wax blend in mixing container, add aqueous phase to it 
and shear with homomixer or colloid mill. At 77C the crude dis¬ 
persion inverts and a thick creamy emulsion forms. Continue 
shearing while scraping the sides of the container to make sure 
the whole content is properly sheared. Add perfume, de-aerate 
and package.

water phase. Combine and heat oil phase to 75C. Blend the pig¬ 
ment phase together until no pigment streaks appear on drawdown. 
Add the pigments to the water until well blended. Then add the 
water to the oil phase under good agitation. At 40C add in the 
protein phase. Continue mixing to room temperature. pH 6.7. 
(Pigment level can be adjusted for desired coverage). 

MU-53 is a light nonionic cover cream designed to even out 
skin tone. A combination of SUPER REFINED Babassu Oil, CRODAMOL 
PMP and CRODAMOL PTIS moisturizes without a greasy afterfeel, 
and allows the skin to breathe. PROVOL 50 is an excellent pig¬ 
ment dispersant. COLLASOL and CROMOIST HYA put a moisture film 
on the skin to help maintain a smooth surface.

Procedure: 

Mix together the ingredients for Phase A and Phase B in 
separate containers. Heat each phase to approximately 70C, 
and be certain all the solids have melted and dispersed in 
the oil phase. Slowly add B to A while mixing on a high-shear 
mixer. Continue mixing for 5-10 min. Cool, with occasional 
stirring, to approximately 40C and mix in the perfume. 

Comments: 

This formulation is designed to remove makeup as well as to 
soften and moisturize the skin. For a less oily formulation, 
the proportions of Mineral Oil and Cyclomethicone can be re¬ 
versed. If Paraffin is substituted for Ozokerite, a much stiffer 
cream will result.

After mixing 91.0 ml of the Exothermic Wave Lotion with 20.0 
ml of the Heat Activator, the following should be observed: 

Regular Formula: 
pH: 8.8-9.2 

Free Ammonia: 0.70-0.90 gms NH3 per 100 ml 
Thioglycolic Acid Content: 9.2% 

Temperature Rise: 18-20C 

Unlike normal permanent waves, the fill weights and the 
strengths of the lotions and the peroxide heat activator require 
very close tolerances. Too little or too much, either as fill 
weight or concentration of active, for either component, will 
cause variations in final activity or temperature.

Heat Phase B (Water, Ivarlan, Propylene Glycol and Foam-Coil 
4C) to 50 deg. C. Carefully prepare Phase C. Mix Phase C until 
clear and uniform and set aside. Add Phase B to Phase A - a 
thin milky emulsion forms. Cool to around 45 deg. C - the 
emulsion will now start to thicken - it is important not to 
add the sodium hydroxide solution until this happens. After the 
thickening starts add Phase C (the Sodium Hydroxide solution) 
slowly. The emulsion will thicken drastically. Improved 
agitation is necessary. After all the sodium hydroxide sol¬ 
ution has been added, agitation should be stopped as soon as 
the cream is homogeneous. Overstirring at this stage will 
result in a cream with poor stability.

Description: 



A medium viscosity, white, glossy lotion. QUATRISOFT POLYMER 
LM-200 contributes to the overall emollient afterfeel by virtue 
of its substantive cationic nature. AMERCHOL L-101 (w/o) and 

SOLULAN 98 (o/w) act as a nonionic emulsifier pair to ensure 
emulsion stability. 

Procedure: 

Add QUATRISOFT POLYMER LM-200 to the water (water phase, 
part A). Mix until thoroughly dispersed, then heat to 45-50C. 
Mix until clear and uniform. Add water phase, part A to water 
phase, part B while mixing while heating to 70C. Heat oil 
phase to 70C. Add water phase at 70C to oil phase at 70C while 
mixing. Cool to 35C.

Comments: 

Emulgade F Special is a self-emulsifying base used for the 
preparation of oil-in-water emulsions. Because it is nonionic, 
cationic substances can be easily formulated into creams and 
lotions. 

This formulation is a light cream and is characterized by a 
non greasy rubout, quick penetration and a soft, non-drying 
after-feel.

Procedure: 

Disperse the carbomer in the alcohol, and mix until it goes 
into solution. Load the Polysorbate 80 and approximately 3/4 of 
the water; mix until uniform. Stir the Dimethicone Copolyol and 
the Triethanolamine into the remaining 1/4 water. Slowly stir 
the Triethanolamine solution into the carbomer solution. The 
lotion will gel and turn clear as the triethanolamine is added. 
The perfume either can be added with the alcohol or stirred into 
the finished formulation. 

Comments: 

This product is designed for use after a shower or bath to 
deliver fragrance and a light emollient effect to the skin. 

As given, the formulation is a thick gel. Lower viscosity can 
be achieved if the amount of Carbopol/TEA is cut back or if 
the final lotion is diluted with water.

Note: *Carbopol 940 is being used here as a slip agent, not as 
a viscosity agent so no TEA is used. 

Comments: 

This formulation is a high gloss lotion with good lubricity 
and rub-in properties. Even with 10% Lanolin Oil, this is a non- 
greasy product that leaves the skin with a soft protective 
feeling.

The use of CUTINA E-24 allows the formation of nonionic 
emulsions that are non-whitening when compared to anionic sys¬ 
tems, in addition to being very mild to the skin. As a nonionic 
it allows the incorporation of a myriad of additives regardless 
of ionic species. Furthermore, this can be accomplished at 
virtually all feasible (cosmetically) pHs.

Procedure:

until smooth. Add the magnesium sulphate and mix until smooth. 
Blend B well and add A to B; mix until smooth and uniform. 

Packaging: 

This formula is a rich, pourable or pumpable lotion and may 
be dispensed from a suitable glass or plastic bottle. 

Comments: 

This formula is an elegant, economical, and easily prepared 
water-in-oil lotion for softening and moisturizing dry skin. 

The use of Veegum as an emulsion stabilizer allows a rela¬ 
tively large internal phase without sacrificing product stabil¬ 
ity. The amount of Veegum used controls the viscosity. In 
addition, Veegum contributes to the rich, nongreasy feel im¬ 
parted by the highly emollient oil phase. The high water in¬ 
creased economy over typical water-in-oil products. 

This formula would make an elegant addition to a treatment 
line as a super moisturizer for dry skin.

slowly to part A with good mixing. 

3. After 5 minutes remove heat and cool slowly (0.5 to 1.0C per 
minute). 

4. When the temperature drops to the 45-40C range the product 
will thicken somewhat and the propeller rotational speed will 
slow down. Increase the speed to ensure thorough mixing. 

5. Cool to 27C or below.

Procedure: 

Heat Part I to 65C, with mixing, until clear. Heat Part II 
to 65C, with mixing. Slowly add Part II to Part I with efficient 
mixing. Remove heat after 5 minutes. Cool slowly. When the temp¬ 
erature drops to the 45-40C range the product will thicken some¬ 
what and the propeller rotational speed will slow down. Increase 
the speed to ensure thorough mixing. Add fragrance, coloring or 
preservative as required. Cool to 27C or below and fill. 

This formula, when made according to above procedures, will 
withstand multiple freeze/thaw cycles, remains stable at 50C for 
at least 3 months and maintains at least 1-year stability at 
room temperature. 

This light-bodied pourable moisturizing lotion provides 
excellent lubricity when applied and worked into skin. The 
after-feel is smooth and silky. Skin is left moisturized without 
feeling oily. MONAQUAT P-TS provides primary emulsification 
and skin conditioning.

Procedure: 

1. Into a stainless steel tank place #1, # 2 , # 3 , #4 and start 
heating and slow mixing and heat to 80C (176F). 

2. In a separate small stainless vessel, blend #6, and #5 and 
mix until a smooth uniform paste is formed. Do not add. 

3. In a separate container prepare the 2% solution of #1 and 
mix till solution is completely clear. 

4. In another container prepare a 5% suspension of #8 and blend 
well until the material has formed a completely smooth 
dispersion free of any particles. 

5. Finally blend both, suspension #8 and solution #7, together 
and then add this blend to the hot batch with good mixing 
and continue agitation and keep temperature at 70C (160F). 

6. Once this addition is completed, start addition of blend of 
#6 in #5 slowly. Keep mixing for 10 minutes then start slow 
cooling while mixing at 50C (120F) then adding #10. 

7. Cool further to 35C (95F) while mixing and add #11, #12 and 
enough of #13 to compensate for evaporation. 

8. Check pH and adjust with small amounts of diluted sodium 
hydroxide solution. 

DO NOT ADD SALT to this preparation to increase viscosity. 
Try only small amounts of additional #5. Adding one half % of 
Lauryl Alcohol will help. 

As color you could use very small amounts of FDC Blue #1 
solution or FDC Green #3. 

To prepare #8, McIntyre used Magnabrite HV made by American 
Colloid Co.

Comments: 

Dehyquart E is a special quaternary that improves the wet and 
dry combability without causing any loss in effectiveness of 
anionic surfactant systems. In addition, the Dehyquart E, unlike 
other conditioning polymers, does not lead to build-up with 
continued use.

Procedure: 

Combine the Disodium EDTA and water and mix until uniform. 

Add the ALS, Crosultaine C-50 and Germaben II. Mix until uniform. 
Separately combine the Incromide CAC, perfume and BHT and mix 
until uniform (heat slightly, no more than 50C, if needed to 
dissolve the BHT). Add this mixture to the water and surfactants, 
blend with mixing and mix until uniform. Add the Croquat WKP and 
Kerasol and adjust the pH. Continue mixing until uniform. 


This shampoo combines the high foaming and cleansing proper¬ 
ties of ALS with the superior foam boosting aspect of CROSULTAINE 
C-50 to produce a rich high lather. The INCROMIDE CAC provides 
additional foam boosting, foam stabilizaton, and fragrance sol¬ 
ubilization. Finally, the CROQUAT WKP and KERASOL provide con¬ 
ditioning and manageability for the hair without over-conditioning 
or buildup.

Procedure: 

Into stainless steel mixing tank measure #1, #2, # 2 , #4. 

Start heating and slow mixing and heat to 70C (16OF). In a 
separate stainless or glass container blend #6 and #5 at room 
temperature until a smooth uniform paste is formed which will 
eventually be added later on. 

In another container prepare the 5% suspension #8 and mix 
the suspension till it is completely uniform and viscous and 
shows no undissolved particles. Preserve suspension if not 
used immediately with some #12. 

In another container prepare the % solution of #7 using 
heat and mix well until a perfectly sparkling clear viscous 
solution results. Preserve if not used immediately with a little 
of #12. 

When the temperature in the main mixing tank has reached 70C 
(16OF) mix the suspension #8 and solution #7 together and heat 
to 70C (160F) and add to the main tank while continuously mixing 
well. Be sure that there are no undissolved particles in the 
#1, #2, #3, #4 before the addition of the suspension #8 and the 
solution #7. Add #10. 

After everything is well blended together add slowly the 
blend of #6 and #5 to the main tank. 

After the blending of all ingredients at the high temperature 
has proceeded well start sprinkling the very fine flakes of #3. 
At 50C (120F) add #12 and finally 13. Cool a sample out of the 
batch and check pH and if necessary add #11 to adjust. 

As color a solution of DC Blue #12 seems to be stable.

Formulations containing EMPICOL MD do not readily respond to 
viscosity adjustment using sodium chloride. For those, Albright 
& Wilson recommends the use of Natrosol 250 HHR at a level of 
0.25-0.5% as thickening agent. The Natrosol should be dissolved 
in the water prior to the addition of the surfactants and other 
additives.

Comments: 

The addition of Cyclomethicone to a traditional mineral oil 
based formulation results in improved aesthetics; the product 
is perceived as being less oily when applied to the skin. The 
effect becomes more apparent as the ration of Cyclomethicone 
to Mineral Oil Is increased.

This formulation provides UVA/UVB protection with the use 
of NEO HELIOPAN AV and NEO HELIOPAN MA. This totally eliminates 
the need for PABA and Benzophenone-3 to obtain such protection. 
This formulation has been tested and produced a SPF value of 8. 
With the use of resins, film formers and minimum emulsifier 
levels, it is anticipated that this formulation will be water¬ 
proof .

Procedure: 

Weigh 1-9 and heat to 85C with slow agitation. The blend has 
a cloud point of approximately 80C. Above the cloud point all 
waxes will eventually dissolve in the blend. If a higher solv¬ 
ating temperature is used, solvation can be much faster. Hold 
the wax blend at 85C. Heat 10-14 to 85-90C and stir gently 
until all has dissolved. Hold at 85C. 

Place wax blend in mixing container, add aquoeus phase to it 
and shear with homomixer or colloid mill. At 67C the crude dis¬ 
persion inverts and a thick creamy emulsion forms. Continue 
shearing while scraping the sides of the container to make

agitation. In another vessel able to contain the entire batch, 
weigh Phase B and heat to 75C with agitation. Slowly add Phase 
A to Phase B, mix for 10 minutes and add Phase C. Mix until 
uniform and start cooling with continuous agitation. Cool to 
40C and add Phase D, continue cooling with agitation to 28-25C 
and package. 

pH: 6.8 

Viscosity: 168,000 cps 

Offering a high degree of UVB/UVA protection, this white 
lotion accomplishes this with menthyl anthranilate without 
the use of PABA or oxybenzone. The use of a waterproof resin 
along with minimum emulsifier levels insure no rewetting on 
the skin. This formulation has been tested and produced an 
SPF value of 15. It is anticipated that this product will be 
waterproof.

Procedure: 




1. Combine all of the sodium saccharin, sodium benzoate, and 
sodium monofluorophosphate with all the available distilled 
water and 10% of the sorbitol. Add the FD&C Blue No. 1 and 
D&C Yellow No. 10 solutions. Mix and heat to 45 to 50C. Cool 
to room temperature. 

2. In a separate vessel, add the sodium lauryl sulfate to a 
portion of the sorbitol, using the following weight ratio: 

1 part SLS to 4 parts sorbitol. Mix, using mild agitation. 

Heat to 60C to deaerate. 

3. In another vessel, combine the flavor and SD alcohol 38D. 

4. Combine all the remaining sorbitol with the PEG-32. Heat to 
50C. While mixing vigorously with an electric stirrer, sift 

in the CMC. Mix for 30 min or until the CMC is fully dissolved 
and no polymer gels remain. 

5. Add the polymer mixture to a Ross double planetary toothpaste 
mixer. The cooling water in the jacket should be set to 20C. 

6. Add the salt solution to the toothpaste mixer. Mix at speed 
6 for 25 min. 

7. Add one-third of the hydrated silica. Mix at speed 2 until 
the ingredients are combined. Repeat until all the hydrated 
silica is added. 

8. Increase to speed 6 (highest) and mix for 25 min at a vacuum 
of 27 to 28 in Hg or until homogeneous and transparent. 

9. Add the flavor and SLS solutions. Mix at speed 1 at a vacuum 
of 27 to 28 in Hg for 5 min or until combined and homogeneous.

A denture adhesive is a device applied to the base of a 
denture before the denture is inserted into the user's mouth. 

The device is used to improve denture retention and comfort. 
Although this definition describes the adhesive as a device, 
it is supplied as a powder, cream, or liquid. 

Many products on the market include POLYOX Resins as des¬ 
cribed in U.S. Patents 2978812 and 4280936. POLYOX has the unique 
property of being wetted rapidly by water, resulting in a soft, 
resilient gel between the plate and the jaw. Its tackiness also 
helps prevent undesirable slippage of the dental plate. The low 
toxicity, resistance to attack by salivary enzymes, low odor 
and tastelessness make these resins ideal for denture adhesives.

Procedure: 

1 . Add the sodium benzoate and sodium monofluorophosphate to a 
portion of the distilled water, using the following weight 
ratio: 1 part salt to 10 parts water. Mix until dissolved. 

2. Add the sodium lauryl sulfate to a portion of the sorbitol, 
using the following weight ratio: 1 part SLS to 4 parts 
sorbitol. Mix, using mild agitation. Heat to 60C to 
deaerate. 

3. Slurry all the CMC in the glycerin. While mixing vigorously 
with an electric stirrer, add all the remaining distilled 
water, sorbitol, and PEG-12. Mix for 30 min or until the 
CMC is fully dissolved and no polymer gels remain. 

4. Add the polymer mixture to the toothpaste mixer (Ross double 
planetary mixer, model 130 LDM-2). The temperature of the 
mixer jacket should have been preset to 20C. 

5. Add the FD&C Blue No. 1 solution to the polymer mixture and 
mix until homogeneous. 

6. Add the salt solution to the polymer mixture and mix until 
the salt is fully dissolved. 

7. Add one-third of the hydrated silica. Mix at speed 2 (low) 
until just combined. Repeat until all the hydrated silica 
is added. 

8. Increase to speed 6 (highest) and mix for 25 min at a vacuum 
of 27 to 28 in Hg or until homogeneous and dearated. 

9. Add the flavor and SLS solution. Mix at speed 1 at a vacuum 

of 27 to 28 in Hg for 5 min or until combined and homogeneous. 
Note: If refrigeration is not available, a temperature of 25C 
maximum is acceptable. Temperature control is desirable to: (1) 
avoid batch-to-batch variation, and (2) prevent loss of water 
and flavor duruing deaeration. 

The typical silica gel formulations contain less than 20% 

water. This high-water-content gel contains just over 30% 

water. The CMC-7MXF is necessary to provide sufficient gel 

structure in the high-water formulation.

Procedure: 

With simple agitation, gradually heat the mixture above its 
cloud point <810. If faster solvation is preferred, the mixture 
may be heated slightly above 102C until the wax is completely 
dissolved and a homogeneous solution is produced. 

For stable gels, the solution is fast cooled with simple 
agitation or slowly cooled with good shear. Homomixer or 
colloid mill could be used to generate shear. Objective is 
to create a fine particle size gel where the fine polyethylene 
particles interlock to create this thixotropic body. At 10C 
below its cloud point, simple agitation is again used and the 
gel is agitated to a temperature where it is still packageable 
without causing air entrapment.
