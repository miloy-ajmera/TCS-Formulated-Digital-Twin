Cocoa Butter: Cocoa Butter is naturally harvested from cocoa beans, and is a rich, nutrient-packed super ingredient loaded with antioxidant CMPs (Cocoa Mass Polyphenols) for superior skin care and moisture barrier protection. 
Vitamin E: An antioxidant superhero, Vitamin E is skin’s number one friend, smoothing scars and protecting skin from damaging free radicals.
Argan Oil:  Commonly referred to as “liquid gold” and has twice as much Vitamin E as olive oil. Rich in essential fatty acids and vital antioxidants.
Sweet Almond Oil: Rich in Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, E and Omega 6 and Omega 9 fatty acids plus has anti-microbial properties.
Elastin: Enhances flexibility, softness and smoothness of skin, improves skin elasticity and overall tone.
Collagen: The protein that makes up the fibrous support system from which skin is made.
Raw Shea Butter: Shea Butter contains natural vitamins and fatty acids, to help nourish and protect the skin's natural oils, while soothing skin with natural anti-inflammatory properties which makes it ideal for sensitive skin. Aids in natural collagen production to help build the skin barrier.
