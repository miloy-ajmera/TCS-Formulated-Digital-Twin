        Abstract
        
      



          Purpose:
        
      
      To perform a retrospective analysis of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung adenocarcinoma who developed brain metastases (BM) to evaluate our hypothesis that the use of upfront EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and deferral of radiation therapy (RT), would result in inferior intracranial progression-free survival but similar overall survival (OS).
    


          Methods and materials:
        
      
      Of 202 patients diagnosed with EGFR-mutant NSCLC between July 1, 2008, and December 31, 2014, 71 developed BM. Twenty-one patients were excluded owing to prior EGFR-TKI use, EGFR-TKI resistance mutation, failure to receive EGFR-TKI after whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT)/stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or <6 months' follow-up. Of the remaining 50 patients, 17 received upfront EGFR-TKI followed by SRS or WBRT, 17 WBRT then EGFR-TKI, and 16 SRS followed by EGFR-TKI. Disease-specific-graded prognostic assessment was similar among all 3 groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The median OS was longer in the upfront RT group compared with the upfront EGFR-TKI group (34.1 vs 19.4 months; P=.01). On subgroup analysis, the SRS group had longer OS than the upfront EGFR-TKI group (58.4 vs 19.4 months; P=.01), but the WBRT group did not (29.9 vs 19.4 months; P=.09). Intracranial progression-free survival was improved in patients receiving upfront RT compared with those receiving upfront EGFR-TKI (37.9 vs 10.6 months; P<.001).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The present study suggests that the use of upfront EGFR-TKI, and the deferral of SRS or WBRT, may result in inferior OS in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who develop brain metastases. A prospective, multi-institutional, randomized trial of upfront EGFR-TKI with RT at intracranial progression versus upfront RT followed by EGFR-TKI is urgently needed.
