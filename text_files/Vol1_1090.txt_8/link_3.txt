 Water and Oil don't mix on their own.  When it comes to creating a cream or a lotion, something must be done to water and oil based ingredients in order for them to combine.  Emulsion occurs when water is allowed to encapsulate oil molecules with the help of a stretchy ingredient called an emulsifier.  Lecithin is a common emulsifier found in nature.  In cooking, the lecithin contained in egg yolk allows chefs to create luscious emulsified sauces such as mayonnaise or hollandaise.  Creams and lotions are created in a very similar way.  Only when it comes to lotions and creams,  other ingredients must be used to maintain a stable, long term emulsion.  Emulsifying Wax is an ingredient that has been especially formulated for this purpose.  It contains just the right amounts of wax and emulsifier to maintain a stable emulsion in most simple cream or lotion formulas.  For beginners, I often recommend this ingredient.  It is very easy to use, even when you are creating your own recipes from scratch.  
You can also create an emulsion with the help of natural ingredients.  However, unlike Emulsifying Wax, natural emulsifiers must be used in conjunction with each other in order to work.  The best combination to start with is Beeswax, Liquid Lecithin, and Borax.  Together, these ingredients can help to create a stable emulsion of fats and waters.
To create a basic emulsion formula, try working with this simple formula:

1 part Emulsifier
3 parts Oil / Vegetable Butter
6 parts Water or Hydrosol

The emulsifier part can be 100% Emulsifying Wax, or a combination of 80% Beeswax, 10% Borax, and 10% Liquid Lecithin.  Try experimenting with the amount of water, oil, or emulsifier you have to create unique textures.  You can also try switching Beeswax for other waxes, such as Candelilla, Carnauba, Bayberry, or Floral Wax.  
To create the emulsion, start by heating the waxes and oils/butters together, along with the lecithin, if you are using it.  In a separate container, heat the waters along with the borax, if you are using it.  When both phases have become hot, and the waxes have fully melted, begin whipping the water phase. Slowly pour a very thin stream of the oil/wax mixture into the water phase while continually whipping.  After the ingredients are fully combined, continue to whip the mixture for at least a full five minutes.  The mixture should become thick and opaque.  
Depending on your ingredients your mixture can vary in texture and appearance wildly.  Achieving a stable emulsion may also require some tweaking of these ratios depending on the ingredients you choose.  Becoming an expert on making creams and lotions is an adventure!  Embrace experimentation, and don't lose heart when formulations break or fail.  It is all part of the learning process.  For a more in depth look into handmade emulsions, check out Making Aromatherapy Creams and Lotions by Donna Maria, an indispensable guide to cream and lotion making.

I can’t understand what is exactly emulsifying wax. It is a combination of other waxes or something like that? Can this be used for creams formulated for combination, oily or acneic skin types? I know that this kind of skin types can’t handle really well waxes like beeswax for example. Which one is the most adequated emulsifier for those skin types? Thanks!

Emmy Gabriel says 
June 8, 2011 at 3:03 pm 

Hi Emma.  Emulsifying Wax is a vegetable based wax that has been blended with alcohol and synthetic emulsifiers to create an easy to use emulsifier for cream and lotion recipes.  Im not aware of any effect that this ingredient has on acne prone skin one way or the other.  If you are concerned about using the ingredient, you may want to perform a patch test on your skin with a small batch of cream made with it, before making or using a large batch. 
If creams and lotions that use waxes tend to bother your skin, you may want to look into using a Moisturizing Facial Oil instead.  We have a great article on blending those oils at the following link: https://naturalbeautyworkshop.com/my_weblog/2007/12/creating-moistu.html

Just came across your site and glad I found this article. Just started lotion making using e-wax NF and I find no matter what formulas I use my cream is not stiff, should I add some beeswax? Also, the organic cream I am using has just one emulsifier (vegetabel based e-wax it says) does that mean it is NF or are there other emulsifiers for W/O emulsion/  Any tips would be much appreciated.
Thank you

Emmy Gabriel says 
August 8, 2011 at 5:02 pm 

Getting a cream recipe to be thicker or thinner usually depends on the proportions of water, emulsifier, and fat.  Try increasing your fats, and see if that does the trick.  Youll also achieve a thicker texture by using butters or oils that are hard at room temperature instead of liquid oils.  Some great choices are Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, or Babassu Oil.  Adding some extra beeswax could also help stiffen your lotion, but keep in mind that beeswax doesnt emulsify on its own, and there may be a limit to how much you can add without adding more E-wax or an additional emulsifier, such as lecithin and/or borax.  Try experimenting in small batches and see how it goes. 
The term NF means national formulary and is added to the titles of certain ingredients that meet certain specifications of the National Formulary, an organization that creates standards for ingredients used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.  The term is often used by suppliers of ingredients, but less often attached on ingredient labels.  That doesnt necessarily mean that the wax used in your lotion is not NF, it may just not be labeled that way on the container due its being a sort of in-industry term.  Whether or not an emulsifying wax is titled NF should not affect its ability to emulsify in a lotion or cream.

I love your site and many of the posts, but it disappoints me to see all the logs out there who post natural recipes, but some of them contain toxic ingredients. Borax is an ant poison. I just stopped using castor oil in my products because while I love it, it just doesn’t seem safe enough. I know you’re trying to help but condoning borax,while its “natural” is not very safe! I do love your articles, and it’s not just you, I just wish good recipes weren’t spoiled by this.

Rose Geranium essential oil will also kill ants, yet has therapeutic properties for people. Chocolate is also fine for people to eat, yet is harmful to dogs, and the list goes on and on. Please do not assume that all species share the same anatomy, therefore the same things that are good or bad for each.
Also, while on the subject of borax, many people think that borax and boric acid are the same thing; they are not. They are different chemical compounds. Boric acid’s chemical formula is H3BO3 whereas borax is Na2[B4O5(OH)4]·8H2O.  Very different compounds with different effects.

Thanks for sharing that with us, Wishful. Making healthy choices is a very personal decision. Everyone has a different measure of what they consider to be healthy or safe enough for them. The beauty of making handmade skin care products is that you get to decide for yourself what you consider safe enough or healthy enough for you and your family. As natural and DIY skin care becomes more popular, alternatives to ingredients like borax or conventional emulsifying wax are starting to appear. Check out our Organic Emulsifying Wax next time you are on our site. Its a combination of beeswax, lecithin, and carnauba.

Can citric acid be substituted for the borax? I think that some people make that substitution in liquid soaps, but I don’t know if it would work in a lotion.

The Natural Beauty Workshop says 
April 12, 2013 at 4:46 pm 

Hi Jaime. The chemistry going on in a lotion is a little different than whats happening in a liquid soap, so unfortunately subbing citric acid for borax wont work. Borax works as part of the emulsfiers in a lotion recipe. One alternative you might consider would be using a pre-formulated emulsifying wax in place of the borax, beeswax combination.

Hi Jackie, 
Thanks for visiting The Natural Beauty Workshop. Some preservatives that are commonly used in lotions, creams, and emulsions are Germaben II, Liquid Germall Plus, and Grapefruit Seed Extract. If you are formulating a product for sale, it is highly recommended to have your formulation challenge tested by a professional lab. They can also help you determine the best preservative to use in your recipe.

Hi:
I enjoy making natural hand and body creams and I place them in a jar. The problem is, with this hot weather, if I leave the jar on my table for a while it begins to liquify. Should I add more Stearic Acid to harden it, or beeswax. The cream is great and I am very disappointed as I do not feel confident mailing it to anyone as I feel when they receive it, it will be liquid.
Please let me know if you have any advice.  Thank you.
Karen

My creams become soft in the Summer weather. It melts and turns to oil. I would like to know, do I need to put more stearic acid to make it thick or what would you suggest.
I don’t think because it’s Summder and the place is hot that my cream should get soft, please advise

The Natural Beauty Workshop says

Hi Karen. The simplest solution is to store the lotion or cream in your refrigerator between uses. You could definitely add more wax or stearic acid to firm up the recipe, but that will also affect the products texture and slip.

Jim Myers says 
August 15, 2013 at 4:25 pm 

Hi Karen. If you remove the stearic acid and add between .60% to .75% cetyl alcohol, that should eliminate that problem. I’ve been doing this (formulating) for about 25 years. This will work. Give it a try. You can get cetyl alcohol at Hobby Lobby. White wax.

Don’t use Borax on your skin. It is not safe, it is for bug control and cleaning. At this point there is no natural preservative, all are synthetic. Some people claim pink grapefruit but that is also a synthetic made product. If its just for personal use, then just make enough to use in a week and refrigerate. Use an immersion or stick blender instead of a beater and make sure everything is at room temp before mixing and there should be no separation. I only use beeswax and haven’t had issues so far. Add antioxidants like vitamin E and know your oils so if you want a longer lasting lotion then use the fattier oils like coconut instead of ones like grape seed. Hopefully some of the silver products will be found to be a true natural preservative, until then either use the poisen preservatives or make smaller batches.

What difference in ratios would you suggest to make a liniment for arthritis. similar to icy hot?
I make my own emulsifying wax, and am imagining an increase of wax and decrease of water would be the key, yes?
Thanks again!

The Natural Beauty Workshop says 
August 28, 2013 at 1:03 pm 

Hi Cliff. I usually suggest starting out with the basic ratio and going from there. You have to be careful about reducing the water phase too much, because that can actually break the emulsion. There needs to be enough water in the formula to get between all of the oil molecules, or the bridge breaks, and the emulsion collapses. I know that sounds a little weird, but its the best way I can think to explain the process. If you want to cream to be thicker, it is sometimes better to add a thickening agent like starch or gum instead of reducing the water.

I am having trouble with stabilizing my water/oil lotion. I currently use E-wax & the same formulation/ingredients. Some days it will be oily/slimy, other days too thin, and it separates. Do I need to add another emulsifier into this to stabilize it more? Looking into guar gum?
Also, I am looking at adding an ingredient to matify. Would silk peptide powder, arrowroot powder or zinc oxide help to get this?

Jodi Kaye says 
September 11, 2013 at 8:22 am 

I have a couple of questions. If you whip a cream or lotion too long will the emulsion break? Also, my lotions are always oily and don’t penetrate quickly. What can I use to fix that? I’m also concerned about not using toxic ingredients. Thanks.

The Natural Beauty Workshop says 
September 19, 2013 at 4:15 pm 

Hi Jodi. Homemade lotions always tend to be heavier and more oily than commercial lotions, but you can reduce it slightly by choosing lighter, more non-greasy ingredients,  and by incorporating additives like silk peptide powder or starches. Emulsions can break if they are whipped for too long. Of course if you don’t whip long enough, the emulsion won’t stabilize either, so it’s all about finding the right balance, which comes with practice.

The Natural Beauty Workshop says 
September 19, 2013 at 4:15 pm 

Hi Andrea. Adding an additional emulsifier would be a great idea. Try lanolin, or lecithin. The addition of Borax can sometimes help too. Silk Peptide, Zinc, or Arrowroot can be added to facial moisturizers by including them in either the water or oil phase, depending on their solubility. Look up each ingredient for its specific usage rate.

“I just stopped using castor oil in my products because while I love it, it just doesn’t seem safe enough”   Where are you getting your information?  Castor oil is a wonderfully healing oil.  Yes, all parts of the plant are poisonous, but not the oil.  “Borax is an ant poison”.  So is any salt an ant poison.
Coconut oil on its own is very drying, it does not prevent me from using it, I mix it with other oils.  I have made moisturizer for 24 years without preservatives because there were never any good, natural choices, now there are from aspen bark, elderberry compounds and the bacillus from kimchee.

Leucidal and Natapres are 2 new preservatives that are natural.  Leucidal is the bacterium in the popular Korean food, Kim Chee and natapres is that same bacterium with the addition of a constituent from honeysuckle and one from aspen.  Shelf life is supposed to be 1-2 years.  They claim to add no smell to your product, but my experience is that they do and I need to add double the scent I used to use in my recipes.  Hope this helps

Both Borax and Salt can help soften water and reduce surface tension. This is part of what helps Borax stabilize emulsions, so there is a definitely a chance that your theory could work. However, I don’t know of anyone ever trying this, so it will have to be an experiment. I would suggest giving it a shot. It never hurts to try, after all. Please let us know how it turns out!

Hi Stephanie. In general, plain waxes like Beeswax and Candelilla require the use of Borax and Lecithin in order to emulsify lotion and cream recipes. You could certainly try using the wax on its own, but I think you’ll find more success by including those two additives.

Actually, borax, or sodium borate, is a perfectly natural mineral used for centuries to heal health problems, both internally and externally.
A little research will set you straight.
Drug companies, of course, hate it because it has the potential to shut down their entire, toxic, corrupt industry, so they set about fabricating ‘Danger, Wil Robinson!’ propaganda and influenced (if not directly demanded) certain governments to help spread the propaganda.
Again, a little research will lay out the realities.

Hi Stephanie! Oil/butters + water emulsions can be quite tricky if using the wrong emulsifier. I have been experimenting quite a lot. Some emulsifiers work perfectly fine on their own (given you’ve used them in the right percentage), and some need to be combined with others in order to do their job. I
From experience, the combination of Emulsifying Wax NF (Cetearyl Alcohol) + Cetyl alcohol works well (the ratio is normally between 7-10% of your formula). Olive-M 1000 works well in combination with Cetyl alcohol, as well as on its own (plus, it’s olive-derived, which makes it more natural).
Speaking of natural, lecithin is the only 100% natural emulsifier which works on its own in basic formulations, but only in water/oil emulsions. I personally find it very challenging to work with.
Whatever you end up using, ask the manufacturer about percentages, combinations etc. as many of these details are not explained clearly.
Hope this helps. Good luck!

If I’m looking at a recipe that calls for emulsifying wax, but I want to substitute it for a natural beeswax/Borax/liquid lecithin mix, would I substitute the exact same amount of my mix as the recipe originally called for emulsifying wax?

Reply






The Natural Beauty Workshop says 
January 12, 2015 at 4:22 pm 

In general, emulsions work as long as the overall ratio for oils, emulsifiers, and waters is sound. In theory, you should be able to swap out the portion of Emulsifying Wax with an equal portion of Beexwas Lecithin Borax mixture (80% Beeswax, 10% Lecithin, 10% Borax). For example, if a recipe called for 10 grams of Emulsifying Wax you could try using 8 grams Beeswax, 1 gram Borax, and 1 gram Lecithin. Of course, some formulations are more tricky than others and swapping out one emulsifier for another may not always be successful. I’d suggest testing your new formula in a small batch before making a larger amount.

You certainly can try experimenting with an 80% Beeswax, 20% Borax combination. I haven’t tried making a lotion with that ratio yet, but I do know that Lecithin is really helpful in stabilizing the emulsion. I wouldn’t recommend skipping it in general, but that doesn’t mean that the emulsion won’t work without it. You’ll just have to give it a shot and see what happens. If you have a chance, it would be great if you could let us know how it works out for you.

It’s not usually possible to truly stabilize a cream after the initial emulsion fails, but you may be able to re-mix it as a quick temporary fix. Try warming the mixture gently then whipping it for five to ten minutes. It may separate again, but that might give you a usable texture for a little while.

Hi – I just discovered this, thank you for an amazing resource.
I’m a healthcare professional looking for a recipe that uses all natural butters, oils… no borax or anything synthesized for extremely chemical sensitive folks.
Is there a lotion (not a harder butter) recipe on this site I could try? Something with the creamy consistency of a lotion. Alternately, can you recommend anything, even perhaps one of the softer more spreadable and non-greasy body butters?
Your help and resource is immensely appreciated.

I would recommend checking out some whipped butter recipes. Body butters that are whipped as they cool end up having a creamy, spreadable texture while still providing the intense conditioning found in a balm. To cut down on the greasiness of your formulations try adding a starch such as Cornstarch or Oat Starch or Silk Powder at around 3-5% of the total formulation.

Hi there,
I have just had a sulphur moisturiser cream fail its stability testing due to seperation at 45 degrees. Everything else was fine. They have advised me to put in an emulsifier such as stearic acid and/or cetyl alcohol to bond the sulphur and make it more stable. Do you have any advise you can give me about how/when to add it to the mixture and what amount I should use. Do you have any other ideas which could help me solve the problem?
The cream is made with shea butter (whipped), sweet almond oil, flowers of sulphur powder, pure essential oils and vitamin E.
The shea butter is whipped, not melted, except for a small amount which I melt in order to mix the sulphur powder.
Many thanks
Yvonne

Can I use Carnauba wax to thicken organic concealer…I need it to be thicker to cover better..

Hi Yvonne,
I am very interested in your recipe as mine is very similar.  I do not add any oil as the shea butter is already rich in vit E and other oils but I do add flowers of sulphur and essential oils.
The flowers need to be heated and strained into the shea.  You will notice all the gritty bits stay behind in the sieve.
I also prepare my shea the way you do but am going to try bees wax to prevent melting at room temp and am also looking at adding borax with that (but don’t won’t to use water)
It would be great to chat.
Janine

Hi Yvonne. This sounds like a rather advanced formulation issue so I’m not sure how much I can help – but I can tell you that emulsions usually work best when both the oil and water phases are heated. If you are emulsifying with the shea butter at room temperature that could be the problem. If you end up needing more help with this I would suggest talking with a private label cosmetics lab. They are experts at stabilizing emulsions and shelf life issues.

Hi Arlo. It really depends on your formula, but in general, yes. You can often use Carnauba Wax as a thickener.

Hi Christy. If you’d like an alternative to making lotions that include water you might want to try making a Whipped Body Butter instead. Our article on Making Whipped Body Butters is a great place to start. https://naturalbeautyworkshop.com/my_weblog/2013/02/how-to-make-whipped-body-butters-1.html

Hi Debbie. I would try replacing the Beeswax at an equal rate to start. Emulsifying Wax is very easy to work with so it should work well as a replacement. If there are other additives (like Lecithin or Borax) in the recipe you may also be able to leave those out.

Hi Simone S.  …
My queries are well after you posted that you’ve had great success w/ your lotion, specifically that you mixed the oils and water WHEN BOTH ARE ROOM TEMP.
I just made my 2nd batch of lotion, and it pretty much separated after the 1st day, and looks like cottage cheese. However, my 1st batch took 2 wks to separate, and still looked like lotion. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the temperatures of the oils and water specifically that time (I must remember to take improved notes!). If anything, the results of my 1st batch is preferable!
Pls comment — MANY, MANY THANKS!  (I don’t really wish to add emulsifiers)
OR – can anyone else comment on Simone’s method, or how to regain my first result?

Hello, So glad I found your lovely site! I am really excited about your Whipped Tamanu & Shea Butter recipe. But I just can’t afford the silk powder. What will happen if I leave it out? Is there any other natural item that I could substitute?
Thank you.

Hi Pat. The Silk Powder in the Whipped Tamanu Shea Butter recipe helps to impart a silky after-feel on the skin. It’s a totally optional ingredient in the formula and can be omitted completely or substituted with a starch such as Arrowroot Powder, Oat Starch, or Corn Starch. Either way I think you will still love the finished butter!

Hi Charity. Emulsifying Wax already contains cetyl alcohol so you shouldn’t have to add the ingredients separately. This is what makes Emulsifying Wax such an easy emulsifier to work with. It takes a lot of the guesswork out of the formulation.

Hi Yatin. Emulsions, like lotions and creams, can be a little tricky and sometimes it takes a little practice before making them comes easily. The two very best emulsifiers to use are Emulsifying Wax or a combination of Beeswax, Lecithin, and Borax. While you may be able to find alternatives with some research, I can’t personally vouch for how well they work or how easy they are to use. The two types of emulsifiers I discuss in this post are, in my experience, the easiest and most consistent. I would recommend trying an established recipe that uses the Beeswax, Lecithin, and Borax combination and practicing with it until you get the hang of creatinf stable emulsions. After that you can move on to formulating your own recipes. Here is a link to a recipe that uses that combination as an emulsifier. The essential oils it mentions are optional. http://www.fromnaturewithlove.com/recipe/recipe.asp?recipe_id=246

I just made a green tea cream with aloe gel, beeswax, coconut oil and pumpkin seed oil. It came out great.  I would have liked a creamier consistency but didn’t want to ruin the batch by trying to add more aloe. I did ruin my lavender lotion, too much hydrosol with the aloe gel.  I want an emulsifier that is organic.  Is there an organic borax to use? Thanks.

Hi I’m trying to make my own ‘unorthodox water based’pomade. These new pomades at work like classic oil based. But are using emulsified wax to make it much easier to wash out.
Wondering if u knew any recipes for pomades like this?

Hi Rene. Borax is a type of mineral salt. While it isn’t available as a certified organic ingredient it is generally considered natural. The blog, Crunchy Betty, has a really helpful post about Borax and her concerns on using it here: http://www.crunchybetty.com/getting-to-the-bottom-of-borax-is-it-safe-or-not
Unfortunately there are not a whole lot of natural alternatives when it comes to emulsifiers. My personal favorite emulsifier other than the beeswax, borax, lecithin combination is Emulsifying Wax – a soy wax pre-blended with cetyl alcohol. It is not natural, but it is non-toxic and very easy to work with.
I hope this helps, Rene. If any other readers have a suggestion for a borax substitute please leave a reply!

Water soluble pomades are usually made with a lot of heavy-duty emulsifiers, silicones, and preservatives so they are a little outside of our wheel-house. I don’t know if I have personally ever seen an all-natural water-soluble pomade, but finding one would be the first step toward cracking this code. Take a close look at the ingredients they are using and see if you can figure out the ratios and techniques they use to achieve the final product. Good luck! If you come up with a recipe please let us know. We would love a guest post!

Hi Alicia. Usually cetyl alcohol is used as a support ingredient to another emulsifier. For example, it is used along with a plant-based vegetable wax in Emulsifying Wax to make emulsions. It will probably not work unless it is used in chorus with wax and possibly other ingredients such as lecithin, borax, or salts.

What a great page!  Not just the original article, but all the comments, questions, and answers.
I like to make creams with about 2/3 oils/fats and 1/3 water, and you indicate the beeswax borax lecithin is better for. Oil in water rather than water in oil. Can you recommend a similar natural emulsion that isgood for WIO?

This article was very informational. I’m starting a lip gloss line and I’m still trying to make my glosses a little thicker (sorta goopy). Is the emulsifying was a good option? Or an alternative to beeswax? My products are 100% vegan.

I know this is a super old thread but I’m hoping someone can help! I used witch hazel, oils and added a bit of lecithin and a splash of xanthan gum and arrowroot powder. I know have what looks and feels like a creamy, rich lotion but this doesn’t sound right correct? I thought I needed something like a wax to thicken it but when I added the xanthan it gave it a beautiful consistency. How can I know if this will hold? Is there like a lotion stress test? I’m making gifts and would love your input before sending them out.

Hi I wanted some advice on making breast milk lotion. I tried a recipe which was 3oz Breastmilk, 3oz grape seed oil. 1tablespoon beeswax and 3 drops lavender essential oil. This split, which now I understand could be due to my ratio, should I have done 1.5oz grape seed oil? Or should I add in liquid lecithin to help combine? Also should I add grapefruit seed extract to prevent mould? I’m new to all this and want to choose natural products as it’s for use on my baby. Thank you for all your advice! Your article is so helpful! Xx
