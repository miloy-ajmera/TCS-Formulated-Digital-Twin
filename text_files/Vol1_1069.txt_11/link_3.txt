Allow a ball to form on the end of the applicator.Holding the applicator at a 45 degree angle, apply a thick layer of wax going against the direction of hair growth then smooth it back over in the opposite direction. Extend the wax strip slightly past the area to wax to give yourself a pulling tab.Allow wax to set on skin until it becomes dull and slightly tacky to the touch. Note: If wax is too thick or left on skin too long it becomes brittle and hard to remove.With your fingertips, press the "set" wax down to flatten the wax against the skin and ensure the wax has adhered to all the hairs.Flick the extended wax pull tab up, hold the skin taut and pull wax off (parallel to the skin) with one quick motion in the opposite direction of hair growth.Immediately apply firm pressure to epilated area with the cushion of your fingers or palm of your hand to calm the skin. Note: Hard wax can be reapplied up to 2-3 times if necessary.IngredientsGlyceryl Rosinate, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum, Huile minÃ©rale), Ethylene/VA Copolymer, Beeswax (Cera Alba, Cire d'abeille), Stearic Acid, Paraffin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Fragrance (Parfum), Yellow 11 (CI 47000).QuestionsAsk a QuestionReviewsWrite A REVIEWLove itI bought this to try on my underarms. It was so so much easier to use than the soft wax and strips that came with my warmer. It's awkward  to me to diy my underarms and bc this is hard wax it was just easier to control and use bc no strip. Also less mess bc the wax isn't left sticky on the skin. It pulled out all my hair !! You can just pull up the wax if any wax is left on skin. Will buy again.Not quite rightI wanted to love this because the bears are so cute, but it's not the easiest to use. I used with a wax warmer. If I get the wax to the right molasses-like consistency, it's way too hot for the skin. Any cooler and the texture is thick and lumpy and difficult to work with. I had to pretty much either mildly burn myself or press really hard with the applicator sticks. Got the job done but definitely won't be buying again :(Cute in theory22023-02-23Very cute product with great packaging. Love the idea of customizing the amount of wax used which does speed up the process however compared to the original Gigi hard wax this formula does not perform the same. Didn't grip hair as good so lots of stray hairs left behind.It's ok32023-01-19Pretty painless and easy to follow the instructions. But the wax hardens almost immediately, making it impossible to spread. Also doesn't pick up fine hairs. Took half the can to use for half of one leg. Get it for the tin if you have their warmer.Not quite right22023-01-02I wanted to love this because the bears are so cute, but it's not the easiest to use. I used with a wax warmer.

Got the job done but definitely won't be buying again :(Explore other hard waxes before trying this one12022-09-25I've been experimenting with different wax brands. I love the soft wax from GiGi but I am not a fan of this hard wax. It took a very long time to heat up and it did not pick up a significant amount of hair. It also was not a full cans worth.It works!42022-09-05This is my first time with this home wax kit. Normally I use Bliss wax, but they were out at my local Ulta and I gave this a try. The wax takes a while to get the wax to the right temperature, but the wax is easy to use. The only side effect is that the skin is a little sticky afterwards.Ultamate RewardsBecome a MemberAbout RewardsUltamate Rewards Credit CardApply NowManage My CardUltamateRewardsCreditCardGet HelpTrack an OrderShipping and DeliveryReturnsGift CardsWays to ShopGuest Services CenterContact UsFeedbackOur CompanyAbout UsDiversity, Equity & InclusionCareersInvestorsCorporate ResponsibilityProduct SubmissionsAffiliate ProgramSupply Chain TransparencyUB MediaSocial MediaFacebookLook for best productsInstagramFollow for best offersPinterestSocial MediaTikTokTick TokTwitterBest OffersYoutubeLook for best productsDownload the AppScan the QR code with your mobile device.Q R CodePlayStoreDownload the ULTA Beauty App from Google PlayAppStoreDownload the ULTA Beauty App from the Apple StoreSign up for news and special offers.Receive emails or texts about our latest sales, new arrivals and special offers.Sign upÂ© Ulta Beauty, Inc. 2023 Powered by Quaziâ¢ Privacy PolicyTerms & Conditions
