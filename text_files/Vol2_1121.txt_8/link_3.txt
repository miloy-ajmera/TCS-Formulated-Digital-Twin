Glycerin has long been used by our mothers and grandmothers and was an essential part of their beauty repertoire. This is because of the many glycerin skin benefits that held them in good stead long before all the fancy creams and lotions flooded our markets. Glycerin has been as popular as it has a beauty essential over the years because it has a range of amazing benefits that beauty junkies all over the world are rediscovering. We compiled this exhaustive dossier on all the wonderful glycerin skin benefits; the many glycerin uses for face; and easy tips and tricks about how to use glycerin on face.
What is glycerin?Ways to use glycerin on facePrecautions for using glycerin on faceBenefits of glycerinAll your queries on glycerin answered hereWhat is glycerin?


Glycerin, also called glycerol, happens to be a colourless, odourless, sweet-tasting liquid that has a very thick, viscous consistency. A by-product of the soap-making process, this sugar and alcohol organic compound, is derived from both plant and animal sources and is used extensively in the beauty and pharmaceutical industry for its many benefits for health and beauty.
Ways to use glycerin on face


Step 1. Wash your face with water and pat it dry with a towel to soak up the excess water from your face.Step 2. To ensure that after you dry your face it should still feel a tad damp.Step 3. Take a little bit of glycerin on a cotton ball and dab it onto your skin.Step 4. Avoid the mouth area and eyes at all cost.Step 5. Don’t wash it off right away but leave it on for a little while to let it get absorbed into the skin.

2. Glycerin is a great cleanser and it can take the place of the expensive chemical-based cleansing milk and solvents that you generally tend to use.Step 1. For best results, you can mix three teaspoons of milk with a teaspoon of glycerin.Step 2. Apply it on your face at night and wash it off in the morning.

3. Glycerin gently removes dirt, oils and make-up from your skin.
You could also make a homemade facial cleanser by mixing half a cup of water with one and a half tablespoons each of glycerin and cornflour in an ovenproof glass jar. Bring the mixture to a boil till the mixture looks clear. After the mixture has cooled, apply a little on moist skin and wash out with warm water.

4. Glycerin can be used as a toner.
Step 1. Dab on a little glycerin diluted with water for toning after you wash your face as it helps tighten your pores.Step 2. Make a toning solution by mixing about one-fourths of a cup of glycerin with one and a half cups of rose water.
Precautions for using glycerin on face
You have seen how the use of glycerin is very beneficial for the face. However, there are some precautions that you need to take when applying glycerin on the face. While glycerin is very mild and rarely causes hives or rashes, in some women, glycerin does cause an allergic reaction.

1. This water-soluble, non-toxic compound is also remarkably gentle on the skin although, like with all skin products, you’d be advised to take a skin test on the inside of your arm before you apply it to your face. You must always do a patch test before using some and do contact a doctor if you do develop allergic symptoms like blisters or swellings or hives.

2. Always make sure that you dilute glycerin with water or rose water before you apply it. Use a small quantity and don’t leave it on your face for longer than necessary. Wash off the glycerin after a little while as the viscosity of glycerin tends to draw dust and pollution.

3. Glycerin could also cause a little sun sensitivity so do wear sunscreen after applying some to your face.

4. If you are uncomfortable with using glycerine from an animal source for your beauty needs, you could use vegetable glycerine that is derived from vegetable oils.


Benefits of glycerin
1. As a moisturiser
Glycerin is one of the most effective moisturisers as it helps your skin absorb moisture from the air. The clear liquid acts as a humectant (a substance that retains or preserves moisture) that stops the water in your skin from getting evaporated. Regular application of a glycerin moisturiser will always keep your skin feeling soft and hydrated.

Step 1. Make a glycerin moisturiser for yourself at home by adding two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to 250 ml of glycerin.Step 2. Apply this mixture to your face every night before retiring to bed so that you get dewy fresh skin in the morning.

Here's another home remedy involving glycerin
Step 1. Mix about half a cup of water to one teaspoon of vegetable glycerin.Step 2. Add about one teaspoon cold-pressed vegetable oil like sesame, almond or apricot to this.Step 3. You could add a few drops of essential oil of your choice to get aromatherapy benefits.Step 4. Cool the mixture in a refrigerator and apply it on your face with a cotton pad.

Alternatively, if the idea of slathering your face with glycerin before you go to bed does not appeal to you, you could also apply it pre-bath and get results that are just as stunning.

Step1. Mix Vitamin E oil, Vaseline and glycerin in equal parts and apply on your face before you take a shower. You will see the difference in just a few days. This mixture is a life-saver in the winter months when our skin tends to become very dry and scaly.


2. Anti-ageing treatment
Have you looked into the mirror closely recently and been shaken by the first appearances of fine lines and wrinkles? Well, that is a natural process of ageing that you have to take in your stride. Age also brings about other skin conditions like dull, irritated, rough skin that lacks moisture. Well, there’s no need to panic just yet.

Start using glycerin and you’ll find the fine lines reducing over time because it moisturises your skin and improves elasticity by filling in the tiny cracks in your skin. In fact, this is why glycerin has been used as a popular anti-ageing treatment over the years. Instead of applying plain glycerin, you will double the anti-ageing benefits by applying this mixture instead.

Step 1. Beat an egg white till it is frothy.Step 2. After that, mix in a teaspoon each of honey and glycerin.Step 3. Slather it on your face using upward, circular strokes.Step 4. Let it rest and wash off after 20 minutes.


3. Acne treatment
Anybody who has ever suffered from acne will know what a nightmare it can be with many of the regular over-the-counter applications often failing to work. If you are one of those persons who is looking for a solution to her acne woes, then you can add glycerin to your beauty arsenal. Glycerin has been shown to reduce the incidence of acne. Apply this paste to your face daily and you will soon see the results.

Step 1. Mix a tablespoon of glycerin, half a tablespoon of borax powder that is easily available at a chemist, and a little camphor with a glass of distilled water.Step 2. Once a smooth paste has been made, apply it on your face and allow it to dry.Step 3. Wash it off with ice-cold water to remove the residue and close the pores of your skin.


4. Blackhead removal
There’s nothing that looks as unsightly as blackheads. And sometimes, no amount of facials and OTC treatments can get rid of the ugly black dots. Well, help is at hand because glycerin is one of those wonder products that have an effect on blackheads as well. Here's a homemade blackhead removal treatment that actually works.

Step 1. Take a tablespoon of multani mitti or Fuller’s earth, four tablespoons of coarsely ground almond powder and two teaspoons of glycerin.Step 2. Mix it all together, apply a thin layer on the affected region and let it dry.Step 3. Wash off and see how the blackheads do a disappearing act.


5. Fights skin diseases
Glycerin has a therapeutic effect on skin diseases like psoriasis. Research published in the December 2003 issue of the Journal of Investigative Dermatology found that glycerin helps skin cells mature according to their regular schedule. This is crucial because, in psoriasis, skin cells start shedding before they reach full maturity, thereby causing thick, scaly skin. When you apply glycerin, this allows the cells to mature fully and halts the abnormal shedding. This property of glycerin also helps in the healing of wounds. Glycerin helps your skin heal and helps fight fungal infections like eczema as well by helping in the process of skin repair and regeneration.

Step 1. Apply a mask made with about 4 teaspoons of multani mitti and about a teaspoon or so of glycerin.Step 2. Add a little water to make a smooth paste.Step 3. Apply this on your face using your fingers in circular motions avoiding the mouth and eye areas.Step 4. Let it dry and then wash off with plain water.


6. Reduces blemishes and marks
Blemishes, marks and age spots are hard to get rid of. However, regular use of glycerin has been shown to help these marks fade with time. Glycerin also keeps the skin hydrated, has plenty of antibacterial properties and maintains the pH levels of the skin.

Step 1. Mix some glycerin with petroleum jelly and apply it to your skin.Step 2. Wipe it off with a damp cotton pad after a bit.


7. Lip saviour
Cracked and chapped lips are every woman’s bane, especially in the colder months that can be particularly harsh. While most of us use commercially available and chemical-laden lip balms to get rid of this problem, using the milder non-toxic glycerin is an option that is just as effective and far gentler on your skin.

Step 1. Swipe a few drops of glycerin and honey across your lips and painful, flaky puckers will be a thing of the past.Step 2. Warning: the sweet taste of honey and glycerin might tempt you to lick it, but that will only make the condition worse. Instead, wait for it to dry and then wipe it off with a damp ball of cotton. Do this every night so that your pucker stays kissable!


8. Dry skin solution
Tired of buying expensive lotions and body butter that are inadequate to treat your dry skin condition? Well, this time, ditch those fancy beauty potions and try the humble glycerin instead that will smoothen your skin, heal your cracked heels and soothe the dry skin on your body.

Step 1. Dilute a little glycerin with water and massage your hands and feet and limbs with this every day.

Glycerin also has the ability to exfoliate dead cells and show up the layer of soft, new skin underneath. Make this exfoliating scrub at home.

Step 1. by mixing equal parts of sugar and glycerin and adding some aloe to it.Step 2. Massage your face with this so that the dead skin flakes off and your new skin gets moisturised thoroughly as well.


9. Useful for burns injuries
Burns can be extremely painful and can turn serious if not treated in time. While you should immediately see a doctor for serious burn injuries, you can safely try glycerin for burns that can be treated at home. Unlike medicated ointments, glycerin is mild and will soothe the other accompanying symptoms of burns like itching and burning. It’s super easy to apply.

Step 1. Just apply a diluted layer on the affected area.Step 2. Wash off and repeat many times till the area is healed.


10. As a de-tan solution
You can actually use glycerin as a mild sunscreen because it acts as a barrier against the harmful rays of the sun and environmental pollutants while sealing in the moisture. And if you have already got tanned, glycerin can help you get back to your original complexion by removing the dirt and impurities clogged in your pores and lightening your complexion. Try this easy-peasy homemade mask to brighten up your skin tone in a jiffy.

Step 1. Just grab an overripe banana, mash it up nicely and add a tablespoon of glycerin to it.Step 2. Mix it all up till it’s a nice gloopy paste.Step 3. Slather it on liberally on your face and leave it on like a mask for about 10-15 minutes.Step 4. Wash it off and find your face all glowing and bright.


All your queries on glycerin answered here
Q. Can we use glycerin on oily skin?
A. Glycerin is very good for oily skin as it draws water from the air into your skin to moisturise it without making it greasy. That is why glycerin is present in a lot of oil-free moisturisers. The humectants in glycerin also lock in the moisture in your skin to keep it hydrated. Oily skin that is prone to acne and inflammation will benefit from the skin-soothing properties of glycerin. To ensure, however, that you always dilute glycerin with water before using on oily skin.
Q. How long should I leave it on the skin?
A. Glycerin is generally safe to use on the skin. However, you should never leave it on your skin for too long in its undiluted state. Its thick, viscous nature will attract dust and pollution to your face so wash it off a little while after application. Some remedies, however, as you to leave it on overnight, but this is only when it is diluted with rosewater or some other substance.
Q. Is glycerin soap good for skin?
A. Glycerin soaps are very good for the skin as it is very moisturising and locks in the moisture for many hours after you have used it. it suits all skin types and is generally free from synthetic ingredients. These soaps are great for people with sensitive skin as it has a lower PH than other soaps.
Q. How to treat discoloured lips?
A. Discoloured or dark lips can regain their colour by regular use of glycerin. Apply a mixture of glycerin and lemon juice on your lips every night and you will soon start seeing a difference in the colour. Discolouration caused by lipstick can be remedied by swiping a little glycerin on your lips before you apply the lippy.
