With its latest innovation, Jarchem aimed to provide a chelating agent that is natural and safe for the environment. The result? Biopure GLDA (INCI: Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate), an EDTA-alternative.
Previously: Deciphering Chelating Agent Formulas
EDTA has recently been under scrutiny for its poor biodegradability and accumulation in the environment. Furthermore, research shows EDTA ligands are resistant to bacterial degradation. In response, Jarchem developed Biopure GLDA, a chelating agent that is biodegradable and functions as a low eco-toxic alternative to market standard chelating agents such as EDTA, NTA, phosphates and phosphonates.
Biopure GLDA is stable over a wide pH range. According to the company, this effective chelating agent exhibits high-performing metal-binding properties and high solubility. The strong chelating and dispersion properties of the ingredient facilitate the removal of metal ions from soils, leading to a greatly improved cleaning performance.
The ingredient also functions similarly to EDTA as a preservative booster. It binds to calcium ions in cell membranes to weaken membranes, allowing for better penetration of preservatives.

Small quantities of the ingredient added to formulations can help to stabilize the product and prevent discoloration. Larger quantities will enhance cleaning ability and prevent the deactivation of active ingredients during use. It also reduces the effect of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, resulting in better surfactant performance.
