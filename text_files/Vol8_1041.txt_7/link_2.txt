Keratin is the principle protein found in hair, so the similarity between Crotein™ WKP and the hair’s own proteins, make it the natural choice for hair care products. Protein hydrolysates like Crotein™ WKP are hygroscopic and exhibit powerful moisturisation properties. Due to its low molecular weight, Crotein™ WKP penetrates the hair fibre to hydrate from within and is naturally substantive to hair imparting a soft, silky feel even from rinse off systems. view less

                            Fluilan™ is pure liquid lanolin, sometimes referred to as 'lanolin oil' or 'dewaxed lanolin'. It is a viscous golden liquid, composed of cholesterol-rich esters isolated from pharmaceutical quality lanolin. Fluilan™ contains no additives or diluents and is a cosmetic and pharmaceutical raw material of the highest quality. Like all lanolins, Fluilan™ is of natural origin, being derived from woolwax, which is obtained from sheep's wool without harm to the animal.

Fluilan™ is employed as a moisturising emollient in lipsticks and lip salves where it improves both texture and gloss. Additionally, it is an effective pigment dispersing agent. This product is also ideal for use in skin care oils and lotions. In baby preparations it promotes easy spreading and helps to protect against chafing and infection. Fluilan™ counteracts the drying effects of alkaline soaps and detergents, shampoos and germicidal skin cleansers. view less

                            Incroquat™ Behenyl TMS-50 is a white, pastillated, 50% active behenyl (C22) quaternary conditioning agent and cationic emulsifier based on patented chemistry. This enables the product to be supplied at the highest possible volatile-free activity. As a higher active updated version of Croda's earlier C22 quat, Incroquat™ Behenyl TMS, Incroquat™ Behenyl TMS-50 contains less fatty alcohol and offers ‘adjustable conditioning’, a distinct benefit that allows formulators to manipulate the quat:fatty alcohol ratio and customize their product’s conditioning performance. 

As a primary emulsifier and conditioning agent, Incroquat™ Behenyl TMS-50 has a wide range of applications in hair care and skin care. Because of its exceptionally mild properties, it is an ideal choice for leave-on conditioners and leave-on skin care. It provides softening and emollient effects and gives body and thickness to emulsion systems. view less

                            Keralenis™ is a self-emulsifying delivery system designed to simplify hair relaxer production and provide enhanced functionality. It possesses unique emulsifying properties that allow it to form multilayer lamellar structures within the emulsion that are markedly different to those of conventional emulsifying waxes. Keralenis™ emulsions exhibit a combination of natural substantivity, greater oil deposition and shear thinning (thixotrophy) to promote fast simultaneous release of oil and water-based actives. This translates to advanced hair relaxer quality, as hair will sustain less damage from the harsh chemicals used in hair relaxers and perms. view less

It is ideal for use in hair applications. The unique chemical composition of Keravis™ PE allows it to penetrate into the hair cortex, building strength from within, whilst providing film forming effects to reinforce, lubricate and protect the surface of the hair. These properties combine to strengthen the hair, thus, helping to reduce the degree of damage hair sustains from chemical treatments, environmental stresses or styling practices. view less

                            PolaSperse™ Optima is an oil-in-water emulsifier based on Croda’s patented surfactant-polymer hybrid technology. It offers outstanding performance and stability in high alkaline formulations, resulting in hair relaxers with excellent aesthetics. Hair relaxation tests confirmed that formulations with PolaSperse™ Optima are superior delivery systems for hair relaxer actives. Cosmetologists preferred the hair relaxer formulation containing PolaSperse™ Optima to the benchmark; It was faster and easier to apply on the hair.
Ease of pull through, release of curl pattern, ease of rinsing, straightness and smoothness of the hair and hair integrity were also thought to be better. PolaSperse™ Optima requires lower active oil levels, and is cold process able. Recommended for general oil-in-water emulsions (oil levels up to approximately 80%) and for the following hair care applications: Hair relaxers / straighteners, Hair treatments, Depilatories, ethnic hair care. view less

                            Polawax™ NF is the premier nonionic self-emulsifying wax used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. It is a mild ingredient with a proven safety record and has been used successfully for many years. Polawax™ NF possesses all the advantages of the older type emulsifying waxes, while lacking their disadvantages, such as the tendency for these materials to be incompatible or interfere with certain ingredients. 

Polawax™ A-31 was especially developed for quick breaking foams and mousses. It shows improved solubility in aqueous alcohol and produces better foam body. It can be used to produce viscous or thin emulsions, depending upon the concentration at which it is used.

Croda considers the RSPO’s Mass Balance system to be an important progressive step in supporting the palm oil physical supply chain and creating momentum towards segregated sustainable Palm Oil and Palm Kernel Oil material. To that end, sampling will be of the sustainable palm variant, SP Cropure™ Wheat Germ. view less

Argan oil can be used in soaps, skin, hair and nail care formulations, and as a body massage oil where it rapidly penetrates the skin without leaving it greasy. It is also said to have a regenerating effect, thus helping the appearance of stretch marks and enhancing skin healing. view less
