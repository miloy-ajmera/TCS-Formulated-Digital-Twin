FORMULATIONS with WHEAT AMINO ACIDS







Hair Care: Ethnic Hair Lotion
This formula combines natural shine enhancer and botanicals to condition and smooth ethnic hair while avoiding heavy greasiness. Carbopol® Ultrez 21 Polymer provides easy and efficient thickening for premium lotion performance.














Hair care:Fast Hair Color with CRODAFOS™ HCE (Dark Brown)
Create faster, richer, more vibrant, longer-lasting hair color with this colorant containing CRODAFOS HCE. Data demonstrates that dyes containing CRODAFOS HCE deliver color to the cortex quickly allowing the color to polymerize inside of the hair fiber, resulting in reduced processing times and improved colorwash fastness. In addition, hair dyed with CRODAFOS HCE dyes show less damage and provide great conditioning. INCROQUAT™ HO80-PG provides additional conditioning for easy comb out while CROPEPTIDE™ W and HYDROTRITICUM™ WAA provide excellent moisturization to help maintain hair health.














Hair care: Hair Care Conditioner - THERMAL PROTECTION HAIR CONDITIONER
This formulation provides an excellent conditioning effect, and also contains a combination of wheat
proteins and amino acids that protect the hair from blow drying and curling.
