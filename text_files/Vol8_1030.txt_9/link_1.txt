                            Niacinamide PC is DSM's new, upgraded version of this popular Vitamin B3. Our upgraded Niacinamide PC provides all the benefits of topical vitamin B3 while minimizing potential unwanted effects such as unpleasant sensations of heat in the skin. These are caused by residual nicotinic acid. DSM’s branded vitamin B3 is guaranteed to contain less than 100 ppm residual nicotinic acid, making it exceptionally suitable for skin care applications. Niacinamide PC has also been shown to amplify blue light protection in combination with sunscreens and DSM's DL-Alpha-Tocopherol, and to offer protection from air-borne and water-borne pollution. Niacinamide PC is a white, crystalline, odorless powder with a low content of niacin. It is freely soluble in water and in alcohol, soluble in glycerol, and very slightly soluble in ether or chloroform. It is practically stable to air, light, and humidity. It is fairly stable in solutions. Strong acids or alkalis may cause hydrolysis to nicotinic acid. view less
