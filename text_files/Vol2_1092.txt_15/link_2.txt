                            BELSIL® eco DM 60 000 is a linear, non-reactive, unmodified polydimethylsiloxane, based on renewable raw materials. It is widely used in a diverse range of personal-care formulations. Dimethicones provide a hydrophobic, protective, but breathable barrier for the skin, imparting softness and emolliency. They improve the water resistance of various products, such as sun screens. Simultaneously, they prevent stickiness in skin-care as well as in color-cosmetics formulations. In hair-care products, high-viscous dimethicones are among the most commonly used conditioning additives. They improve both wet and dry combability, impart humidity resistance and a soft feel to the hair, and enhance shine. view less
