What Is Stearic acid?
A fatty acid that occurs naturally in animal and plant fats (typically coconut or palm oil),[1] stearic acid is white, solid, often crystalline, and with a mild odor.[2] It’s a major component of cocoa and shea butter.[3]

How Is Stearic Acid Made?
Stearic acid is a fatty acid typically produced by hydrolysis of common animal and vegetable fats and oils, followed by fractionation (distillation or crystallization) of the resulting fatty acids. Pressing methods separate the liquid unsaturated fatty acids from the solid saturated fatty acids.
Stearic acid used in cosmetics is usually pressed two or three times, resulting in different concentrations.[4] Cosmetic-grade stearic acids are usually mixtures of fatty acids, depending on how they’re manufactured and where they come from (often they’re combined with palmitic acid).[5] There are several grades of stearic acid available commercially.[6]
Stearic Acid Uses 
Stearic acid is an emulsifier, emollient, and lubricant that can soften skin and help to keep products from separating.[7] Stearic acid is used in hundreds of personal care products, including moisturizer, sunscreen, makeup, soap, and baby lotion.[8] It is also used in adhesives, lubricants, laundry products and paper products.[9] Research shows that the ingredient may help burns heal.[10,11]
Stearic Acid Safety
Whole Foods has deemed the ingredient acceptable in its body care quality standards, and studies show the ingredient is not a skin irritant.[12,13,14,15,16,17] The Cosmetics Ingredient Review has deemed stearic acid as safe for use in cosmetics.[18]
