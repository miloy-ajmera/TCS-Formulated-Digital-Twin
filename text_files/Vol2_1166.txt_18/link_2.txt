Description


Garden of Wisdom's Decadent Oat Enriched Emulsion is a decadent, delightful, healing product that is the perfect soothing product to add to your skincare arsenal. It contains no waxes or emulsifiers that cause the pores to become blocked. Having glutathione makes this gel smell relatively intense, but glutathione is incredibly healing, and we mask the scent gently with an essential oil blend. Oat Beta Glucans are one of the finest ingredients for moisturizing, healing, and helping skin that feels itchy and out of sorts.Previously called Decadent Oat Enriched Cream
NOTE: This emulsion's high percentage of glutathione makes the smell extremely pungent. There is nothing wrong with the emulsion. We do use an essential oil blend with this version of the emulsion. Glutathione is discussed in our Blog and is one of the best antioxidants available and is extraordinarily healing.

 Method of ApplicationApply about a dime size of this emulsion to clean and prepped skin. Prepped? Cleanse, tone and you're ready to apply. Add moisture to your skin with spring water, a tonic (alcohol free) or a hydrosol. Dot this emulsion around your face and décolleté both morning and night (if needed). If you cleanse in the evening your skin should only need a soft warm and moist washcloth or microfiber cloth to gently wipe your skin in the morning. Now you are prepped for application.




How To Care For Our Products




Shelf Life and Storage Information forProducts and Ingredients
Finished Products generally don't need to be refrigerated as they are preserved, but you can refrigerate them to extend their shelf life. The shelf life for most products is 9-12 months. Vitamin C Serum(s) and VitaResurface products should always be refrigerated to extend their shelf life.
Sample Sizes do have a shorter shelf life (generally 3-6 months) and items in jars can dry up quicker than this if the lid is not tightened well enough (except our Vitamin C Serums - use within 90 days).
Please keep your products out of high humidity, heat, and direct light, and keep them in a dark cabinet when possible.
Exfoliating Acid products have a shelf life of 9-12 months. The only things we don't suggest refrigerating are the Mandelic Acid Serums or the Salicylic Acid Serums as those can crystallize in the refrigerator. If this happens you can set the product into a hot water bath to see if the crystals will dissolve.
Additional Items Requiring Refrigerationand/or Kept in the Dark 
Hydrosols - remove 1 ounce of hydrosol and add it into a separate, sterilized spray bottle and spritzer. Keep the larger bottle in the refrigerator. Carrier Oils - generally you can refrigerate all carrier oils although some of the very rich oils will solidify. This is fine. All you have to do is take it out, warm it up at room temperature and it should liquefy. If not, setting the bottle in a hot water bath and occasionally shaking the bottle will hopefully turn into a liquid. ^There are some oils that have a super long shelf life like Coconut Cream and Jojoba Oil. Refrigeration is not necessary, but it surely won't hurt. Essential Oils - essential oils are best stored in a cool dark place. Co2 Extracts - these should always be refrigerated. Butters - we suggest refrigerating our "skincare' butters. You can take out what you need and keep the rest in the fridge. Clays - keep in a dry, dark place. Shelf life is at least 2 years. Herbs - all herbs (whole or ground) should be kept in a dark, cool and dry location. Herbal (liquid) Extracts - these are created using alcohol. The alcohol pulls the constituents from each herb. Root, Trunk, Leaves, and Flowers. Extracts have a shelf life of 3-5 years. They can be kept in the refrigerator (or a dark DRY place) Other Various Raw Ingredients - i.e. Sodium PCA, Honeyquat, Oat Beta Glucan, etc. will all have a different shelf life.

Antioxidants such as Vitamins C and E cannot be made by your body and in fact, could not work properly if glutathione were not present. Our immune systems depend on a steady supply of glutathione. Without it, our immune defenses become weakened. It is important in detoxifying many substances including heavy metals, breakdown products of cigarettes and automobile exhaust, many cancer-causing agents, and a multitude of pollutants and toxins we encounter on a daily basis. The major source of energy produced in our cells is derived from tiny structures called mitochondria. These mitochondria would literally burn up without the presence of glutathione.Panthenol D healing, moisturizing, antioxidantCo2 Oat Extract healing, soothingAllantoin relieves dry, itchy, irritated skin, believed to heal the skin by promoting new tissue growthXanthan Gum natural thickenerHyaluronic Acid hydrates, holds up to 1,000 times its weight in waterLeucidal SF (Lactobacillus Ferment) an effective non-formaldehyde, non-paraben preservativeEssential Oil Blend to help mask the glutathione depth of aroma
