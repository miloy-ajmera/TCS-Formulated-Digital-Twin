            Anti-Dark Circles Agents
        

Dark circles under the eyes are the result of the engorged blood vessels. Because the skin under eyes is thinner than skin anywhere else on body, blood vessels there are more noticeable and very fragile. Thus, dark circles are caused by colored pigments that stem from hemoglobin (protein from red blood cells) released from such fragile blood vessels. New cosmetic ingredients are now available that have shown to reduce the appearance of dark circles under the eyes.
