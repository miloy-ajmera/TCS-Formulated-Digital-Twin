Description:
Our most popular daily cleanser gently cleans and exfoliates the skin. Glycolic acid provides deep folicular cleansing to remove impurities and dead cells from the skin and preps the skin for enhanced benefits from additional products used as part of a skin care program. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Face Cleanser's non-foaming, hydrating cleanser leaves the skin clean, soft and hydrated and eliminates the need for harsh post-cleansing toners or astringents. Skin Types:
DryNormal/ComboOily
