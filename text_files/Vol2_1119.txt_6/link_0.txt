                                We have not tested this in this application. If you choose to do so, start at a very low percentage and test in small batch.

                                Sorbitol is not soluble in oil. It is recommended for water-based products.

                "Hi,

good day.  I would like to know if this product is white or clear?  I use the bubble wash thickner and it is white so colors are not bright and vivid.  I want a clear thickner for the shower gel so I can get a transparent color shower gel."

                "Hello, and Happy New Year :), I was wondering if sorbitol is an adequate replacement for propylene glycol in a micellar or face wash recipe?  And if not what replacement(a natural one if possible), would you suggest? and one last thing, if I can swap them would I do it at the same percentage?  Thank you."

                                Hi, you should be able to use this in a micellar water, but we have not used sorbitol in this type of application so you will need to test/research this.

                                We have not used this to thicken either of these applications so you may need to do some research. It can be used in both but we are not sure if it will thicken.

                "Hi, can I use the Sorbitol in my aloe Vera juice  and coconut oil hair spritz? I don’t have an oil phase or an emulsifier, It’s just a mixture that I shake before each use and would like to add the Sorbitol to the mixture.

Thank you!"

                                This is something you will have to test, we have only added to the water phase.

                                You should not have to add anything else. We recommend starting low at about 1 tbs per pound of base and increasing as you'd like.

                                This can be used in liquid soap. We have not tested this but we recommend adding into the lye solution starting at 1 tbsp per pound of oils. You can heat slightly to help incorporate.

                                Yes, this can be used in Castile Soaps. We have not tested this so you would need to test with your formula first. We suggest starting small at 1% and adding until you are happy with the results.

                                It can be added, but Sorbitol so already in Crafter's Choice Melt & Pour Soap bases so adding any more may result in a soft bar. Add this would not prevent the sweating of a glycerin bar of soap.

                                This would not be a good option to thicken our Bubble Bath Base. We recommend the Crafter's Choice Bubble Wash Thickener between 1-8%.

                                You would most likely incorporate this in the water phase of your lotion formula. Typical usage for Sorbitol can range from 5-50%. It would depend on your formula and desired outcome.
