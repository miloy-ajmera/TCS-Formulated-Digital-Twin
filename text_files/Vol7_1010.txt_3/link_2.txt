MIGLYOL 812 N is part of the C8/C10 triglyceride (MCT oil) line from IOI Oleochemical. It is a triglyceride ester of saturated coconut/palm-kernel oil derived caprylic and capric fatty acids and plant derived glycerol. MIGLYOL® 812 N is a Medium-Chain Triglycerides (ratio ~ 60:40%)
IOI is the holder of the first CEP (Certificate of suitability) ever granted for a Medium-Chain Triglyceride and has filed US-DMF Type II. MIGLYOL 812 N has been used in enteral and parenteral nutrition for decades. From a regulatory point of view, the ingredients in some of these formulations are classified as API.
MIGLYOL® 812 N has the following advantages compared to edible oils:

Low in impurities (as a result of production according to EU GMP guidelines)
High stability against oxidation
Liquid at 0°C

The Drug Substance version is a lipid component in parenteral nutrition. Neutral, stable, solubilizer and carrier for oil-soluble actives.
The Excipient version is a neutral, stable, penetration enhancer, drug carrier as well as solvent for oral and dermal use.
Viscosity [mPa·s] ~30 Pa·s
MIGLYOL 812 N Applications

Tablets, dragees: Anti-sticking, polishing agents.
Soft gelatine capsules: Chemically neutral, low-viscosity carrier oil, absorption promoter.
Drops: Carrier, solvent, and absorption promoter.
Suspensions, syrups: Carrier and absorption promoter for antibiotics etc.
Aerosol products: Carrier and solvent (glycerol trinitrate etc.).
Dietetic products & Nutraceuticals: Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) differ from natural fats (LCT). With regard to these essential properties: quick metabolism, not stored as body fat.

Physiological caloric value = 8,2 kcal/g (34,3 kJ/g) compared with LCT = 9,2 kcal/g (38,5 kJ/g).
Different absorption and metabolism properties: MCT is partially utilized if fat resorption disorders exist.


Topical therapeutics – Psoriasis Treatment and Antipruritics: Readily absorbent, scale-detaching and keratin softening oil component, particularly in combination with Vitamin A.
Ointments: Non-oxidizing, absorption-promoting, non-occlusive oil component with excellent spreadability.
Rectal products Anti-nucleating and dispersing aid for active ingredients in Hard Fat (WITEPSOL) suppositories.
