        Mode of Action
    




Panthenol is well absorbed into the skin and quickly converted into Pantothenic acid by oxidation. Pantothenic acid is distributed into the cells and is converted to Acetyl Coenzyme-A (Acetyl CoA) in the cells of the epidermis. Human being require Vitamin B5 to synthesize Acetyl CoA which is an essential mediator to many biochemical reactions that sustain life (maintenance and repair of all cells) and which breaks down fats, carbohydrates and proteins for carbon dioxide, water, and energy generation. Furthermore, it synthesis fatty acids and sphingolipids, for stratum corneum lipid layers and cell membrane integrity & fluidity.
