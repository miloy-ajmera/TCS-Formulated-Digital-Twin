Light and fruity, this olive oil cake from Craft pastry chef Jennifer McCoy is the perfect warm-weather dessert. The accompanying quick raspberry jam, which is perfumed with the freshness and elegance of lavender, is delicious spread over other baked goods or stirred into yogurt. Get the full dessert recipe here, or taste it at this weekend's Chefs & Champagne® New York.
