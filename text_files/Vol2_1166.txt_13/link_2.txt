Methylparaben

INCI name: methylparaben 
  Synonyms: p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester
Molecular formula: C8H8O3 
Molecular weight: 152.15 g/mol
IUPAC name: methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate
CAS number: 99-76-3
EC number: 202-785-7

  Methylparaben is frequently used as a preservative in cosmetics to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold in products that would otherwise be susceptible to microbial growth.1 It is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent that is effective over a widespread pH range. Interestingly, it is believed that the mechanism of action of methylparabenâlike other parabensâis by interfering with cellular membrane transfer processes as well as by inhibition of the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and enzymes in bacterial cells.2 On the molecular level, methylparaben is characterized by its alkyl hydroxybenzoate structure in which case esterification is carried out with p-hydroxybenzoic acid in the presence of an alcohol (in this case methanol) resulting in the formation of the methyl ester of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Other common parabens used to preserve cosmetic products include ethylparaben, propylparaben, isopropylparaben, isobutylparaben, and benzylparaben. 
There has been a lot of concern that parabens are endocrine disruptors and may play a role in the development of breast cancer and male infertility.3,4 Endocrine disruptors are defined as compounds that interfere with the normal function of the endocrine system and can interfere with development and also affect the reproductive, immune, and neurological systems.5 Parabens bind to human estrogren receptors; however, they have very weak estrogenic activity (thousands of times less) as compared to the natural female sex hormone, 17Î²-estradiol (an estrogen), and researchers have argued that such low levels of activity more than likely do not induce a significant in vivo biological response.6-8 Furthermore, research in this area has yet to elucidate a direct relationship between breast cancer and parabens.9-15 
Legislation
In 2014, the European Parliament passed an ammendment to Commission Regulation 1223/2009, which is the regulatory framework for finished cosmetic products. The new ammendment prohibits the use of isopropylparaben, isobutylparaben, phenylparaben, benzylparaben, and pentylparaben in cosmetic products in the European Union.16 Further, the directive provides authorized use levels for methylparaben and ethylparaben as 0.4% for a single paraben and 0.8% for mixtures of parabens. Later in 2014, another ammendment was issued by the European Parliament, setting guidelines for the use levels of propylparaben and butylparaben not to exceed a combined concentration of 0.19%.16 In addition, these two parabens cannot be used in products designed for treatment of the nappy (diaper) area of children under three years of age. The legislation in Europe was passed in response to similar actions taken by the Danish government. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety of the European Union made its decisions based on limitations of available safety assessment and toxicological data for the affected parabens. 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (Asean) Cosmetics Committee (ACC), followed suite with the European Union and passed very similar legislation in 2014.17 On the other hand, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and Health Canada have not passed any legislation regulating the use of parabens in cosmetics. In fact, the FDA states on its website: âFDA scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that parabens as they are used in cosmetics have an effect on human health.â18 In addition, it should be noted that the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panelâan organization based in the U.S. that assesses the safety of cosmetic ingredientsâmet on several occasions (2004, 2008, and 2012) and determined that the parabens are safe for use in cosmetics.15,19 Moreover, parabens are permitted for use in cosmetics by the Ministries of Health in Australia, Brazil, and Japan.
