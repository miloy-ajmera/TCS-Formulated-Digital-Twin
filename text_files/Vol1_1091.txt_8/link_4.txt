Nicholas (Nick) Charles CooperNicholas (Nick) Charles Cooper , 40 passed away unexpectedly April 23rd 2022 in Gainesville Florida. Nick was born in Syracuse New York. Nick grew up in Jordan New York and moved to Florida in 2017 with his son Christopher. Nick created a fulfilling life for himself and his son in Florida with meager beginnings. Nick loved his Harley’s,  dirt bikes, outdoor activities ,the beach, concerts ,festivals and was always up for life adventures. Nick’s love of the outdoors stemmed from growing up on the Yawney Farm. Nick was an experienced brewmaster and horticulturist. Nick’s true integrity and kind heart showed through in his professional career and his volunteer work. At the time of passing Nick was employed by Lester’s Garage Doors in Gainesville Florida where he found an additional family. Eddie and Janet, owners of Lester’s quickly welcomed him and Christopher. Through Eddie’s helping hands Nick found joy in many local volunteer projects. Nick’s pride and joy and sole purpose in life was his son Christopher. Nick’s friends were his family. Nick’s closest friends, Bryan (Burger) Bronson, Ryan Curry, and Danny Becker were his brothers. Many holidays and river adventures were spent with Julie and Kelsy Hornsby (Newberry Florida). Nick was predeceased by his paternal grandparents, Charles (Mickey) and Joan Cooper, and his beloved dog “Goodboysin Killer”. Nick is survived by his son Christopher Jacob Cooper  (Christopher’s mother Amber R Theel) his mother, Jearldean Gray ( Al Gray ), father, Mitchell Cooper ( Dianna Cooper), sisters; Jolene Cooper, Amanda Meyers, Holly Demperio, brothers; Kenny Walker, and David King also many beloved nieces, nephews and cousins.  Graveside services to be held at a future date in Cortland New York.  Arrangements by Milam Funeral Home, 311 S Main Street, Gainesville, Fl 32601.David Henry MitchellA Life Well LivedDavid Henry Mitchell was born the 5th of 9 children on November 15th, 1949, in Wellsville, New York, to father Henry William Mitchell and mother Ida May (Quant).David is preceded in death by his parents and his sisters, Barbara (Donald) Benjamin, Sandra (Lloyd) Hotchkiss, Joyce (Larry) Watson, Doris Doty. He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Nancy Mitchell; daughter Melanie Mitchell, son Todd Payne, brothers Paul (Peg) Mitchell, Daniel Mitchell, Phillip (Deb) Mitchell; sister Karole (Roger) Baker; and grandchildren, Kristie and Kayla Mitchell, and many beloved nieces and nephews.He passed away at 73 years young on Tuesday, March 7th, 2023 after a hard fought battle with cancer.  David grew up in Belmont, NY, until he joined the United States Marine Corps.  After being honorably discharged from the Marines he moved to Florida where he met the love of his life at a Whataburger in Largo FL. David loved his family and the Lord. He lived a life of service to this country and his family. He retired from the US postal service and was a Vietnam Veteran.  Semper Fidelis is the Marine Corps motto, it means Steadfast Loyalty, he embodied this in his devotion to his Lord, his wife, and his family. He was a serious Gator Fan (even in the bad years). He lived life in the fast lane.. literally, the man loved a good, fast car. He was never much of rule follower, just for the sake of following rules, he just always did what he felt was right. He had strong capable hands and even after the RA twisted them, he still gave the best hugs.  He had of habit of whistling, humming, or singing gospel songs when he was in pain, one of his favorite songs was “a merry heart doeth good like a medicine.”   He had a beautiful singing voice. David’s blessings over dinner were beautiful. His faith was such a fundamental part of him that it sounded as if he were talking to an old friend when his rich baritone rolled out the words of grace. Grace was an integral part of who David was; if anyone could find a silver lining in a bad situation, it was him. He was always looking for the best in people, and because of that he would bring out the best in the people around him.David’s laugh is what everyone brings up when remembering him. His laugh was tremendous and infectious; you couldn’t help but laugh along with him. He loved that too.We are planning his celebration of life to be held in June and will update this page when we have the specific date and place.Virginia Ann ThrowerVirginia Ann Thrower passed away peacefully on March 6,2023.She is preceded in death by her husband, Jewell Jr. Thrower, her father Reynold Jackson, mother Winnie Bell Jackson, and her sister Patricia Workman.She is survived by her brother-Harold Jackson, sister- Linda Finnel, Daughter-Vivian Sharp, Daughter Marilyn Aceves (Robert Aceves),

Her maternal grandparents loved her dearly and were very involved in her life to include her favorite aunt Jeanelle until the day she passed away in 2018. Holly is named after this dear God fearing aunt. Holly is survived by her mother, Jeannine E. Daniel, her father, Robert M. Hughes, her brother, Clay Shelley, whom she was very close to, those two were thicker than thieves as my Dad said. and of course her sweet dear son, Theron Drake Ciano, who is named after her maternal grandfather. ** Her maternal grandparents were Cornelia & Theron Daniel. Her maternal great grandparents were Rev. Heflin Daniel and Katie Daniel, and Essie Mae & Arlice Erquitt.Holly was identified as early as one month old as being a genius and had one of the highest IQ’s in the world @ ~~ 220. Therefore she attended the Advanced Academy for Gifted Children at West Georgia College at the age of 16. While there she was invited to apply for the National Merit Scholarship and she wrote her essay non-nonchalantly in half a day and won a $50,000 scholarship to the University of Florida originally on a pre-med course. Holly was a senior in college at the UF at age 18 and valedictorian in her high school in Tucker Georgia having obtained her first Associates Degree two weeks prior to her actual high school diploma. She was a very good child and student with Mom never having to go to the school for any reason except to pick up academic awards.Holly went on to graduate from Santa Fe College with a degree in Nuclear Medicine and would save many lives at the UF Shands Brain Trauma Center as a R-EEG. Not only was she an R-EEG but she taught medical residents in neurology and neurosurgeons under her care while at the Brain Trauma Center for five years.She was a good mother and had begun teaching little Theron how to write cursive, and required him to read double the amount of books than the school required. She has been such an inspirational mother that little Theron taught himself blacksmithing before the age of 10. She worshiped and adored her son.  He needs to know that. All the pictures she sent were of her and him and what he had accomplished at such a young age.Holly was an inspiration to her mother having inspired her to read books such as Atlas Shrugged and to broaden my horizon beyond what I thought I was capable of. Holly had also been an expert at origami having been taught by the Japanese children her mother worked with when she was a small child.Her mother, Jeannine, is thankful to report having had closure with Holly, having had a good conversation about life and I told her I loved her during our last conversation on Sunday night December 18th.Dr. Pat SmittleOn Christmas evening, Dr. Pat Smittle went home to her heavenly Father, Lord, and Savior.The youngest of five children, she was born on November 27, 1937 in Bodcaw, Arkansas to Chris and Gertie Butler.In 1955, she married Burrell Smittle and they moved to Gainesville in 1964.A lifelong educator, Pat received her B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Florida,

Nancy passed first on December 2, 2022, and James followed her on December 6, 2022. The Weeks’ 56th wedding anniversary is approaching soon, on December 22, 2022. Jim was 82 years old and Nancy was 77 years old at the time of their passing.Jim was born (1940) and raised in Gainesville, Florida. He attended Gainesville High School and PK Young High School. After graduation, Jim followed in the footsteps of his uncle and older brother and enlisted in military service. Jim served full time in the United States Army, and then in the U.S. Army reserves until his retirement.  Nancy was born (1945) in Detroit, Michigan, but spent most of her life in Florida. After graduating from Pasco High School, Nancy attended Jacksonville State University on a full scholarship and later attended the University of South Florida, where she studied accounting.   Nancy and Jim were wed on December 22, 1966. They soon started a family and raised three children together: James “Jimmy”, Jennifer, and John. Nancy chose to be a stay-at-home mom while Jim supported his family through his work for the Alachua County School Board and the Army Reserves. Nancy later joined Jim at the Alachua County School Board, initially working at Wiles Elementary School and then working in the Zoning and Finance departments. Together they served the Alachua County School system for over 40 years.   Nancy and Jim spent countless hours volunteering and supporting their children in football, cheerleading, and band. They gave generously of their time and talents and developed a strong bond with their extended family of band parents and band kids. When they weren’t busy sewing costumes, building sets, chaperoning field trips, or working concessions to raise funds, Jim and Nancy could be found relaxing at the lake with their family — water skiing, fishing, and cruising in their boat.  After their children had children of their own, Jim and Nancy shifted their focus to their grandchildren. Much as they did with their own children (but with a lot more spoiling and a little less discipline), Jim and Nancy focused significant time and attention on their grandchildren, Richard, Brianna, and Anna. They volunteered in the schools, chaperoned field trips, and frequently joined their grandchildren and their grandchildren’s friends for lunch. Their grandchildren were as comfortable at Meme and Papa’s house as they were at their own.   Nancy and Jim are preceded in death by Nancy’s parents, Inna Belle Baker and John Horace Oakley; Jim’s parents, Walter Monroe Weeks and Sarah Ellen Field; as well as Jim’s brother, Calvin Weeks, and sister-in-law, Geraldine “Jerry” Weeks.  They are survived by Nancy’s sisters, Joyce Wells (Carl) and Pam Cleland (Steve); Jim’s brothers, Robert Weeks (Jennifer) and Billy Weeks (Sydni); their children, Jimmy, Jennifer Adkins (Scott), and John; and their grandchildren, Richard, Brianna Wood (Garrett), and Anna Adkins. In honor of Jim’s service as a Mason and Shriner, and Nancy’s passion for supporting children and teens, the family requests that charitable donations be designated to Shriners Children’s Hospital in loving memory of Jim and Nancy.Click here to donate.

Newberry RD Newberry, FL 32669. 352-472-5361 www.milamfh.comCecilia Audelle NossCecilia Audelle Noss was born May 26, 1940, the daughter of Jacob Asa Arnold and Audelle Marie Lee in Cedar Falls, Iowa, USA. Her parents moved to Cedar Rapids for her father’s job during the war years. As big sister, she often took care of younger brothers John Philip and Mark Lee.  After Mark was born, when her mother worked on night crews, Cecilia took on home duties including cooking evening meals. In spite of very limited means, her parents emphasized education. They encouraged her musical talent by providing music lessons.  They bought her a quality viola that she brought with her through life, playing in orchestras from the Iowa Southeast Symphony Orchestra in her teen years to amateur orchestras in Cameroon, Kenya, and England in later years. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Creative Writing and a high school teaching certificate at the State University of Iowa in 1962. A life-long learner, she completed a Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing at Vermont College in 1989.After graduating from college, Cecilia inquired of the Presbyterian Church, of which she was a member, about serving as a teacher in India, but they had no missionary activity in India at the time. She approached the Methodist Church, but they would not employ a Presbyterian. She then turned to the United States Foreign Service in Washington DC. She was on track to be assigned to a US embassy in an African nation, when her plans were interrupted by Philip Andrew Noss, whom she had met at Christus House, a lay theological community, while at the University of Iowa. She married him in 1963 and shared a life of service with him for 58 years.Four children were born into the family: Andrew (Lauren Samuels), Haldor (Rebecca Paine Noss), Darcy (Peter Molnár), and Kathleen (Tyler Van Buren), and nine grandchildren, Wesley, Monika, Jesse, Lukáš, Maja, Caleb, Charmian, Jay, and Asa.Cecilia had studied a little French in college, but when she accompanied her husband to Africa for work in Bible translation and literacy, she was obliged to learn the local African language, which she did by participating in the lives of village women, especially through the children, hers and theirs. Languages played an important role in her teaching: arts and crafts for missionary children from Norway and the US; Cameroonian school children reading and writing stories in their own language; Kenyan street children going from the jargon of the streets to Swahili, the national language, and to English; university students practicing creative writing in English for their professions in Nigeria; and the very basics of reading for women in villages in Cameroon so that they could sing from the church songbook and read Scripture texts in Gbaya.When her husband retired in 2005, the couple moved to Gainesville, which was much warmer than the weather of Cecilia’s home state of Iowa. She especially appreciated and enjoyed the rich cultural, academic, and religious setting of the Gainesville community. With her husband, she joined University Lutheran Church and made it her home until November 27th, 2022 when she passed away at the age of 82. She is fondly remembered by family and friends around the world as an authentically kind and caring person who was not afraid to stand by her convictions. Funeral service at University Evangelical Lutheran Church, 1826 W.

Mary was born on September 5, 1931, in Quincy, Florida and was the daughter of the late Arthur Lowell West and Janet Elizabeth MacGowan West of Tallahassee, Florida. Mary grew up in Tallahassee, except for a few years when the family moved to Key West, circa 1936, while the State of Florida employed Mr West to design auto bridges from Flagler’s railroad bridges which were destroyed by the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. Mary graduated from Florida State University in 1952 with a degree in Home Economics, a degree she utilized all her life. Mary was a proud member of Kappa Delta Sorority at Florida State, as was her mother.She met her future husband, Dr William Eugene Ryon, III, in Panama City, Florida. They married on January 9, 1954, just before he transferred from Tyndall AFB to USAF Air Force Hospital Wimpole Park, near Cambridge, England. Mary and Gene remained married for sixty-eight years. Their eldest child, Rebecca, was born there in March 1955. After returning home, they lived in Asheville, North Carolina (Dr Ryon’s hometown) for eight years, after which they moved (with four children) to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for two years while Dr Ryon earned his master’s degree in pediatric dentistry. Their youngest child, Sarah, was born in Chapel Hill. From there, the family moved to Winter Haven, Florida, where Dr Ryon and his brother, a pediatrician, opened the Ryon Pediatric Clinic. Mary’s greatest joy was her children, whom she adored her whole life. The family remember well how she made all their dress clothes during their formative years. They drew lots of attention when they went anywhere. She even made two of her daughters’ wedding dresses. She was known for her ability to cook and entertain large (or small) dinner parties. She was also an award-winning impressionist oil painter. After all her children were in college, she decided to be a nurse and enrolled in the Polk College nursing program. She had only one course to take to get her R.N. but had to drop out because of a breast cancer diagnosis. After treatment and recovery, she decided to build a beach cottage on a small building lot in Panama City Beach, Florida. She drew the plans, selected a builder and oversaw the construction. The family and friends enjoyed that beach cottage for years. Mary was a very talented girl scout leader and 4H leader and was able to take as many as thirty scouts camping on weekends. She was also instrumental in starting two Anglican Churches, St. Mary’s in Winter Haven and All Saints’ Anglican Church in Gainesville. By attending a synod in Dallas, she was able to help secure a priest for All Saints’ Church, Fr. John Leasure. In 1998 she met a man walking an in-training guide dog and soon became a Southeastern Guide Dog puppy trainer and was able to keep one of them, Gerdie, who also died earlier this year. Mary was preceded in death by her parents and two of her brothers, Alexander (Sandy) West and his wife Margaret Lewis West, her twin Lawrence (Larry)West, her sister-in-law Nancy Bendel Ryon, her brother-in-law, Dr Alden Billings Ryon, and her son-in-law Steven Ray Riedy. Mary is survived by her husband, Gene, and their five children: Rebecca Ryon Riedy, Kevin Eugene Ryon (Trudy), Mary Lucy Ryon Ling (David), Heather Ryon Kennedy (Harry), and Sarah Ryon Brassel.

June was a lifelong resident of Gainesville and a fourth-generation descendant of two of Florida and Alachua County’s early pioneer families.June started dancing as a young child. The home in which she grew up included boarders and was always full of activity and joyful moments gathered around the piano. Small town Gainesville afforded June many opportunities to perform. She taught dance classes from an early age and owned her own studio. Along with dance June was a majorette.

They met when she was in the eighth grade and Harry a sophomore at Gainesville High School. A wise P.E. teacher asked his student assistant (Harry) to help June with her batting skills and the rest is history. Early courtship included Sunday evening church services (in the balcony), then walking June home, stopping along the way at Evan’s Soda Fountain for a coke float. The devoted couple married after Harry’s return from World War II, happily together until his death in 2004.June was a lifelong Christian and active member of First United Methodist Church. She loved volunteering in the nursery, teaching Sunday School and hosting youth group functions. June joyfully shared her passions! Some favorite community activities included volunteering in the local schools her children and grandson attended, helping at the Woman’s Club Spring Pilgrimage in the Duck Pond area, choreographing musicals for the Gainesville Community Playhouse, UF and teaching a musical theatre class at the university. June was a member of the Thomas Center Associates, Gainesville Woman’s Club and Dance Masters of America among other organizations. Finally, June was a cherished wife, mother, grandmother, aunt and friend. Her greatest pleasure was spending time with family, especially her grandson Ty and sweet collies, Zadie and Monroe. She loved the water, relishing weekends with relatives in Crystal River and Crescent Beach.A true optimist throughout life June found beauty in everything and saw the best in everyone. Even in the final days she enjoyed car rides with her daughters, tap dancing along to the 1940’s music on the radio.June is preceded in death by her parents, husband Harris H Green, son Harry, Jr and sister Ettiedean Curry.

Even in his final days and hours, as he faced terminal illness, Blake displayed thoughtfulness, courage, curiosity and most of all, gratitude, qualities that contributed to him being loved by many.Blake was the second child of Eleanor (Velk) and Ronald Landor. His early years were spent in California, in the Bay Area. Blake’s sister Talitha has a memory of being taken by her older brother to a local park and playing in a sandlot as he shot baskets on the court, during which time she somehow lost her precious new pair of bright red leather shoes. Nine-year-old Blake spent 45 minutes digging in that enormous sandlot until he found his little sister’s shoes–an early instance of Blake’s determination to accomplish tasks he set himself.Blake’s love of books, intellectual inquiry, and classical languages began to be cultivated as an undergraduate at St. John’s College, a Great Books school he graduated from in 1969. Both he and his sister Amiel received their bachelor’s degrees from St. John’s and together they carried the unique and hard-earned moniker of being a ‘Johnnie’. Drawn to academic pursuits, Blake enrolled in graduate school at the University of Texas, in Austin, receiving a Master of Arts degree in Classics in 1972. He then undertook a doctoral program at the University of Toronto, and in 1980 received a PhD in Philosophy, completing and defending his dissertation on Aristotle.It was in Toronto that Blake met his future wife, Evelyn (Lyn) Straka while they both worked on the Greek Index Project, where Lyn was supervisor. On their first date they sat outside in a park and read Plato’s “Timaeus”. Blake and Lyn were married in June 1980 and spent forty-two years of companionship together. Even in the last months of Blake’s life, he and Lyn would return to their love of classics and read Greek and Latin together.In 1983, Blake received a Master of Library Science degree from Rutgers University. He held a number of teaching and librarian positions at universities in Toronto, New York, Illinois and Kentucky, and in 1990 he became the Classics, Philosophy, Religion Librarian at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Blake spent the next 26 years working at the University’s George A. Smathers Libraries, until his retirement in 2016. The field of library science changed greatly during his tenure with the advance of technology, and he adapted to changing trends in his field, and taught and mentored many. The widespread, deep affection for Blake among his colleagues was made evident at his surprise retirement party, where he was given gifts relating to his library disciplines of Classics, Philosophy and Religion, including a cookbook titled “The Philosopher’s Kitchen: recipes from Ancient Greece and Rome for the modern cook” and paid many tributes. One colleague called Blake “a person of peace and good cheer.” A peer in the field of philosophy said of Blake that “he exemplified the Stoic approach to life more than anyone else I have ever known. He improved me both as a scholar and as a human being.”Blake had a rigorous intellect. In addition to Greek, he read in Latin, German, biblical Hebrew and French. He held his own in debate, and yet he was not dogmatic in his views, but was thoughtful in considering opinions opposed to his own and willing to change his mind if the strength of opposing arguments was compelling. He did not require adherence to his beliefs as a condition of kinship. His brother Barth recalls a fierce email exchange he and Blake had over a political matter, the intensity increasing with each message, while at the end of every email he made sure to sign off, “Love, Blake”.If Blake lived a life dedicated to the intellect, he was also a person of deep feeling. He was a loving presence in his family’s life over many decades, eager to make connections on a walk, over a game of chess, or during a meal, and quick to enthuse over the achievements of younger generations in the family. Blake’s pursuit of truth, and his persistent truthfulness, were not academic preoccupations but essential attributes of his honorable character. Jewish by heritage, Blake came to feel a strong bond with Israel, and studied the Jewish Bible in its original Hebrew.Blake’s siblings cherish memories of holidays together, sharing good food, long walks, rousing debates, and competitive games of Charades. His sister Regina remembers his visits to their hometown in Berea, Ohio and the way Blake would swoop her up and take her for a ride on his shoulders, his tall, lean frame reaching up to the branches of the trees. From her earliest age, Blake made her feel tall and important. His sister Amiel recalls spirited conversations between them. Blake always took pleasure and generous awe in his youngest sister’s adventures and positive perspective. On her 50th birthday he blessed her deeply by referring to her as ‘a female Odysseus.’Blake’s appreciation for humor ran deep, and his laugh rang loud and true. His family grew to depend on his compassion and thoughtful advice and presence in their lives.He is predeceased by his mother Eleanor and father Ronald, as well as his older sister Raissa. He is survived by his wife Lyn Straka, sisters Talitha Sanders (Ellen Martin), Regina Landor (Billy Woodward) and Amiel Landor, brother Barth Landor (Heather Antti), nieces Mikalina Rabinsky, Shoshana Sanders, Rebecca Landor, Sarah Munoz, and Cecilia Landor, and nephews Lyd Landor, Ethan Woodward and Gabriel Woodward.Anyone wishing to honor Blake’s memory with a donation may contribute to St. John’s College (campuses in Santa Fe and Annapolis), or to Prairie Creek Conservation Cemetery, where Blake was laid to rest surrounded by natural beauty and loving family and friends.Ronnie P.

He loved nature and had many adventures hiking, fishing, and hunting.  Ed always had a dog or two, up until these last few years. They were well loved! He made yearly trips to Europe to visit relatives and friends and honor his northern Italian roots. Watching football, and dining out were a couple of his favorite activities. In retirement, he lived in Melbourne Beach, then Worthington Springs, and finally Gainesville. He spent summers near Rockport, Maine, driving back and forth in an RV. Three years ago, Ed moved to the North Florida Retirement Village in Gainesville.  Up until mid – December, he was still living independently.  He died at ET York Haven Hospice, after a brief illness, surrounded by loving friends.

Born August 24, 1944, in Gainesville, she grew up with an affinity for music, later receiving vocal training and singing in a number of solo and ensemble performances and stage musicals at Gainesville High School and the University of Florida. A compassionate and generous soul, Sandra could fall naturally and easily into conversation with anyone, even a perfect stranger. This empathy would lead to a lifelong passion for helping others, ultimately leading to a career in records keeping and the intake of patients at the Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, from which she retired in 2012. Sandra relished new experiences and especially loved traveling around the country and internationally with her daughter, Kat. After retiring and moving to Fort White with her family in 2015, she continued to help her others through medical woes and personal tribulations, while seizing every opportunity to enjoy life, have fun and try new things. Her love of music endured, and she enjoyed attending musicals and concerts, and you could often find her singing and dancing along with her favorite songs, anything from country Garth Brooks to heavy metal Ghost.

Wilkinson M.D.“Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder.” – E.B. WhiteEdward J. Wilkinson MD, Professor Emeritus at the University of Florida College of Medicine, died just after sunrise on the Solstice, December 21, 2021, surrounded by his family. He was a scientist, physician, teacher, mentor, friend, as well as a loving husband, brother, uncle, father, and grandfather. He was 83.
Edward was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Anne Razbornik Wilkinson and Edward Daniel Wilkinson MD. Educated at Marquette University High School, Marquette University, and the Medical College of Wisconsin, he received his MD in 1964. He interned at the University of Illinois Research Hospital and completed a residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Milwaukee County General Hospital. Following a fellowship in Gynecological Pathology at Harvard, he served as a major in the US Air Force from 1969-1971. He returned to the Medical College of Wisconsin for a residency in Pathology and in 1974 was appointed to a faculty position in Pathology at MCW. In 1980 he was recruited to the University of Florida College of Medicine with dual appointments in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and as Professor of Pathology. He remained in this position until 2017 when he retired as Professor Emeritus. During his long career at the UF College of Medicine he served in many senior positions including as Interim Chair and then Vice Chair of Pathology, a position he held until he retired in 2017.
Dr. Wilkinson was an internationally respected figure in the field of pathology. He published over 160 referred articles, 50 book chapters and 3 books, mostly focused on gynecologic pathology and cytopathology. He was an active educator of medical students, residents, and graduate students; he especially enjoyed his work directing the yearlong fellowships in gynecologic cytology. Over his years of service 31 fellows completed his program. He was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award of the College of Medicine in 2017.
He served as president of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease, president of the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and president of the Florida Society of Pathologists. He played an advisory role in the development of Gardisil, a vaccine developed by Merck to prevent cervical cancer, the first successful anticancer vaccine. He served on advisory committees at the Food and Drug Agency and the National Institutes of Health as well as WHO. He served on numerous professional journal editorial boards, including serving for 12 years as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease.Edward loved learning, and cultivated lasting and loving relationships with many people, and with the natural world including the birds, trees, marine life, and waters he loved so well. After retirement he joined the UF Retired Faculty Organization, and was a member of the Natural History Society, The Woodworkers Club, and The Poetry Group at The Oak Hammock Retirement Community. There he served on the Curriculum Committee of the Institute for Learning in Retirement and was President of the Athenaeum Society.Following his diagnosis with terminal illness, he authored a book of essays called “Learning, Forgetting, and Passing It On” on topics of chaos, entropy, and finding meaning in the world. Proceeds from sale of the book are donated to nature conservation charities.
Edward was known for his kindness, wisdom, respect, and compassion for others, as well as a wry sense of humor. He generously shared his time and knowledge with anyone who came to him with questions on navigating medical diagnosis and care. He was a guide not only for family and friends, but for friends-of-friends and wide circles beyond.
Edward was a respectful steward of the natural world. He would cease from conversation to stand in silent awe at the appearance of a hawk, the sound of the sandhill cranes overhead, the rising of the moon, or the lift of a dolphin’s fin. He loved to be on rivers, lakes, and oceans in almost any kind of boat. His deep caring for others extended to everyday acts of compassion such as rescuing a trapped wild butterfly and making sure it could fly free.
He is survived by his beloved spouse of 55 years, Kathleen Murphy Wilkinson; his daughters, Amy Wilkinson (Greig Mulberry), Kim Wilkinson (Rahul Gupta), and Heather Wilkinson (Marc Donis); by grandchildren Minka and Victor; by his brother James Wilkinson (Christine Beck); and by many dearly loved nieces and nephews, cousins, and other relatives.

Keith loved to smile, tell a joke, and be a friend. He never met a stranger and would share his last nickel with anyone in need. He loved life and lived it to its fullest until a motorcycle accident left him paralyzed in 2013. He always thought he would walk again and gave it his all.
Keith grew up in North Carolina, where many of his friends still live and keep in touch since childhood. He moved to Vero Beach, FL, where he learned his trade that would lead to the creation of his small business, Quality Seamless Gutters in St. Cloud, FL. He got just about every job he bid because people just liked him. Keith resided in St. Cloud, Fl. from 1994 to 2019.
His family moved to Hawthorne, FL, in 2019 so his wife could pursue her doctorate at the University of Florida. The love Chrissy had for Keith was repaid with an overwhelming amount of pride and adoration he had for her.
After his accident, Keith was relegated to a life of telling stories and making people laugh. It is with a very sad heart that we say goodbye to our husband, father, brother, son, and friend. We know he rests in peace with those we love who have gone before him.
There will be a visitation at the funeral home Tuesday evening from 5-7 p.m. Funeral Services will be at 11:00 a.m. Wednesday July 14, 2021 at the Milam Funeral Home Chapel.

Don, age 86, was born in Madison, FL to Franklin J. “Jeff” Owen and Ada Williams Owen. He graduated from Bronson High School where he played basketball, earning Player of the Game in the 1952 Basketball Tournament. He worked for Department of Forestry and Georgia Pacific before relocating to Gainesville with his bride in 1962. He had a 30+ year career with the City of Gainesville as a lineman and crew foreman before retiring in 1987. He was frequently amused that he had been retired longer that he worked and how he no longer worried that he’d be called out to work during heavy rain storms. He was quick witted and always ready to cut the fool with anyone who would engage in his antics. He loved the outdoors and there were few weekends that did not have camping, fishing or hunting adventures included. In his golden years, he preferred a good football game with a big bowl of ice cream.He is preceded in death by his sweetheart and wife of 49 years, Dorothy Lane Owen, parents, Jeff and Ada Owen, brothers, Ray Owen and Leon Owen, and sister Betty Berryhill.

Ann was born in Brooklyn, New York, on July 30, 1930, to Drury Tillman Boyd and Sibyl Sanderson Boyd. After an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt (a copycat of the Lindbergh baby kidnapping), her parents moved their young family to Joplin, Missouri, where Ann enjoyed a quiet upbringing. As a young woman, she developed an eye for color and detail and created a number of landscape paintings, which her family treasures. She attended the University of Tulsa where she met her first husband, Charles Hugh Arlen. On their wedding day in 1950, during the Korean War, Charles was drafted and joined the Air Force, serving in Germany. Their daughter, Shelley Ann, was born during his deployment. The family later moved to San Tome, Venezuela, where Charles worked as a petroleum engineer for Mene Grande (Gulf Oil). For Ann, that experience led to a lifelong love of traveling and learning about other cultures. Tragically, at this time, she gave birth to a boy, David, who died shortly after. Spending five years in Venezuela, the family then moved back to Tulsa, where Ann’s artistic sensibilities led to her work as interior designer for Charles’ home construction company. She also owned an antique shop—The Mermaid in Utica Square, specializing in marine antiques. The shop, with Charles’ help, was known for salvaging and refurbishing parts of retired WWII Liberty ships, selling portholes, hatchcover tables, binnacles, and such.
After a second son, Stephen, also died in infancy, Ann and Charles adopted a baby boy they named Paul. The couple lived in Tulsa for over 22 productive years. But, with their growing love for the salty seas, and once their two children were grown, they retired to Cape Coral, Florida. Three years later, after a cruise to Alaska, they moved again, this time to the Pacific Ocean, residing in Friday Harbor, one of the San Juan Islands in Washington state, where they led an idyllic life cliffside, overlooking the ocean, cruise ships, and whales. In retirement, Ann devoted herself to another passion: the Russian Romanov family. She did extensive traveling, research, writing, exhibiting her collection of vintage photographs and other period pieces, and speaking on the troubled and tragic family, spurred by empathy with Tsarina Alexandra who also had a son with a deadly illness.
Eventually, they moved stateside to Gainesville, to be near their daughter (previous Chair of Library West and librarian at the University of Florida) and her husband, Dr. John H. Moore (previous Chair of Anthropology at UF) and their two daughters and son. When Charles died in 2004, Ann moved to Oak Hammock, where she led an active social life and served on numerous committees. It was then that her high school sweetheart, James “Jim” Call, reconnected with her. A Navy veteran and retired human resource manager, Jim had often thought about Ann and was ecstatic that he had finally found her. It was a joyous reunion and they were married in 2007. Ann and Jim enjoyed taking cruises, learning about other cultures, and reminiscing about their shared experiences as children. They later moved to the Village in Gainesville. She is survived by her husband, Jim, daughter Shelley Arlen, grandchildren Dr. Jessica S. Heft (Jordan) of Gainesville, Alexandra M. Moore of Tallahassee, Jeremy M. Moore (Kara) of Deltona, and four great grandchildren – Caleb, Malia, and Serena Heft, and Allison Moore. She was preceded in death by her parents, three sons, and son-in-law, John.

She was a fun, adventurous, loyal friend. She was a dedicated, strong, caring, gifted teacher. She was a sympathetic, caring, and protective animal lover. She was an inspirational, devout catholic who lived her beliefs on a daily basis. She loved music – all different kinds, from Big Band to Cowboy music – that would get her hands waving and toes tapping within the first 5 notes. Margaret encompassed all that was good to many people over many years. She leaves us with an example of living every moment fully and bravely… and with a dancing heart!Margaret was born Rosemary Catherine Ash on May 19, 1930, to Lucille (nee Patton ) and Albert A. Ash, in Detroit,  Michigan. She spent her childhood with her parents and siblings: twin sister Virginia (“Ginny), sister Dolores (“Dee”), and brother Albert (“Sonny”) in Michigan and Florida.After her twin sister’s tragic death at age 14, Rosemary finished high school, and later college, under the tutelage of the order of Ursuline sisters. She joined the order, and there, changed her name to Margaret Mary. She received her education, training, and initial teaching experiences with the order. Her excellence and talent as a teacher were recognized, and she was urged to continue with her teaching career outside of the order.She soon accepted a teaching position with the Exxon Oil Co. in Venezuela. She shared her gift of teaching with many appreciative middle school students over many years, at the Escuela Simon Bolivar, in Amuay.  She dearly loved her students and positively influenced their lives. She also touched the hearts of colleagues with whom she taught. Her love of teaching extended beyond retirement, with volunteer work teaching and tutoring some of the most challenging students. Her sympathetic warmth, gentle kindness, courage, and patience inspired her students.It was in Venezuela that she met and fell in love with her husband, Robert J. Kadala. He clearly admired and loved her gentleness, kindness, strength, determination, devotion, wit, and delightful spirit. After retiring to Houston, Texas, they were married on August 13, 1980. They lived happily in Houston, and later in Pearland, Texas, until his death in 1991. Margaret never stopped loving Robert. She missed him dearly, and looked forward to a time when they would be reunited.Margaret later left Texas and moved to Sun City in Bluffton, South Carolina, to be closer to her sister Dolores. Sadly, not long after, Dolores passed away. However, Margaret easily made friends there – traveling, sharing adventures, dancing, and playing cards and MahJong with the “Widda Ladies”. Many of these dear friends maintained connections with her via phone calls, cards, letters, and visits even after she moved away.After Margaret followed her best friend, Edythe, to live at the Seabrook in Hilton Head, she suffered a fall and then a stroke, which left her unable to walk and robbed her of her independence, which she valued so much. Her devoted friends in South Carolina were often by her side to lovingly care for her and encourage her recovery. Despite all efforts, Margaret was not able to recover enough to return to her previous level of independence.In July 2018, Margaret moved to Newberry, Florida, to live with, and near, family. She was regularly entertained by great-granddaughter Charlie’s songs, dances, and chatter, as well as phone calls, cards, and visits from family and friends. Dogs, Zabi, Kado, and Pip, knew exactly who to go to for treats or a game of fetch. She was also assisted by an excellent caregiver, Amy, who attended to her with love and humor.Margaret was preceded in death by her parents, Lucille and Albert Ash; siblings: Virginia Ash, Dolores Barnes, and Albert Ash; husband Robert J. Kadala, in-laws: Roger Kadala, Stanley Kadala, Lucy Kadala, Edward Kadala, Earl Kadala, Kenneth Kadala, Pat O’Hara, Beatriz O’Hara, and Tom Barnes; nephews:  Robert R. Kadala, Johnny Kadala, and Doug Ash;  “sister-in-law” Evelyn Zink; and best friend Edythe Rennick.Margaret is survived by her stepdaughters Maria-Elena Kadala and Veronica Kadala (Jim);  her grandchildren: Britta Gruenwald (Jim), Ryan Rummel, Michael Forgione (Marian), and Christa Rummel; her great-grandchildren: Madeline Gruenwald, Dalton Gruenwald, Charlie Rummel, Mia Forgione, and Logan Forgione; sisters-in-law: Nancy Kadala, Ninfa Kadala, Connie Kadala, Olga Kadala, Linda Urreztietta, and Pat Ash; nephews: Stanley Kadala (Kyra), Roger Henry Kadala (Beatriz), and Gary Ash (Terry); nieces: Anita Kadala, Lolita Kadala (John), Lori Sears, and Arlene Touzi (Brek); as well as numerous members of the Kadala, Ash, O’Hara, and Joiner families.In addition to family, Margaret is lovingly remembered by her closest friends: Jo and Lyn Bailey, Betty and Bill Palcic, Sharon Mabry, and Amy and Jim Waldrop.A funeral mass will be held on June 26, at 10:30am, in the St. Andrew  Chapel at St. Gregory the Great Catholic Church, in Bluffton, South Carolina.

He was born February 21, 1947 in Tallahassee, FL. He lived in Gainesville for many years and then retired to Salt Springs, FL.
Morgan served in the United States Navy right out of high school (Gainesville High School) from 1966 – 1970 as a Gunner’s Mate. He served 4 tours in Vietnam. Morgan was stationed with a marine convoy unit and was responsible for bringing supplies and artilleries to troops on the ground.
Morgan married Shelia Mary Denaro on August 23,1968 and divorced in 1976. He later married Rosemary Bass, his high school sweet-heart and love of his life on June 11, 1979. His hobbies were dog hunting, fishing, and racing.
Morgan had a unique and charismatic way about him, when the good Lord made him, they broke the mold. He loved his family and friends and would die for them if needed but I truly think he loved his hunting dogs more. His nick name was “Big D” but most of his true friends just called him “D”, and you always knew where you stood with Morgan. He did not sugar coat anything and never had a problem telling you exactly how he felt. Morgan was a true patriot, and he loved his country. He was as old school as it gets. Morgan will truly be missed by his family and friends.

He is survived by his daughters Bambi Cooper (Roy) of Gainesville, and Mary Bass of Woodsville, NH, and sons Sam Bass (Roslyn) and Shaun Tufts (Tina); siblings Johnny Bass (Cathy) of Orange Heights FL, Ray Bass (Brenda) of Hawthorne FL, Debbie Bass of Hawthorne FL and Dean Bass (Sara) of Huston TX; grandchildren JR, Niki, Johnny and Jacob of Gainesville Fl., Alexandra, Christana and Bobby of Woodsville N.H., Morgan and Austin of Melrose FL, and Shaun, Wesley and Kaylee Hog Valley, FL; and 11 Great grand-children.

Clarence Wesley Coonce, Jr – Wes to his friends, Claire to his wife, Junior to his parents, Papa Coonce to neighborhood children, Papa Pete to his grandchildren, and Pater Familias to us all – drew his last breath, asleep in his bed, lying next to his wife, Elizabeth, as she reached her hand out to touch the expanse of his back. He was not known by millions or even thousands, but the hundreds who did know him will never forget him.Wes inspired in those he met sometimes awe and reflection, other times joy and raucous laughter, the rest of the time they just wanted to smack the crap out of him. But whatever he inspired, it was always intense, urgent, a matter of life and death. He questioned everything and taught those around him to do the same. Even when debaters disagreed with him, they came away changed.No stories about Wes could be written successfully, for he is an unbelievable character: a philosophizing migrant worker, a country-living computer programmer, a swindling PhD student, a conspiracy theorizing Mensa member, an outlandish, bombastic, adventure-seeking, prank-plotting, Elvis-wailing, tall-tale-spinning, dirty-joke-telling, dancing buffoon who spent his life contemplating the meaning of human existence. He lived many lives over the course of his 78 years, and he nailed every one.To read more about Wes’s life, visit forevermissed.com/clarence-wesley-coonce.

It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our mother, Jean Doris (Cain) Dixon. She passed on January 1, 2021 at Haven Hospice, Gainesville, Florida. Her daughter, Virginia, and good friend, Mary Jean, were at her side in her last hours.
Mother was born on September 3, 1927 in Louisville, KY to Lucille Winn and William Cain of Irvington, KY. The family moved to Clarkson, KY in 1932 where her father, an excellent cook, had a café. She fondly remembered him feeding men who would come to the back door during the Depression. Her father always referred to her as “Pete”. She married James Dixon on October 26, 1945 in Elizabethtown, KY. They went on to raise three daughters in Wilmington, OH.
Mother’s greatest love was her family and Christian faith. She is survived by daughters, Sandra (Ed) Davis of Richardson, TX, Barbara (Kent) Ames of Lansing, MI and Virginia Dixon Wood of Gainesville, FL. Grandchildren include Carrie Davis Taub, James Edward (Jed) Davis, Lyndsay Ames Wing, Beth Ames Eggleston, and William and Ben Wood. Great grandchildren include Bailey and Bethany Bower, Natalie and Meredith Wing and Claire and Connor Eggleston.Others include niece and nephew Dan Clater and Sally Baer.She was predeceased by her parents and sister Virginia Clater of Louisville, KY.
After residing in Wilmington, OH for many years, mother made a courageous move to Louisville, KY where she shared good times with her sister Virginia and worked for the March of Dimes. In 1990 she moved to Gainesville, FL which she described as the happiest time in her life. She was close to daughter Virginia, enjoyed the climate, and worked for Haven Hospice. She enjoyed playing bridge, eating ice cream, going to the beach , reading and watching football. She was a great Florida Gator and OSU Buckeye fan! She would have loved the OSU – Clemson Sugar Bowl! Mother was a survivor. She was a child of the Depression, a young war bride, survived rheumatic fever as a young mother, a heart attack, and kidney disease. In 2000, daughter Virginia blessed her with a kidney, so we had 20 more years of memories together. We are so grateful to Virginia. As she aged, Mother’s most ardent wish was to remain in her home. Special thanks to her wonderful caregivers, Mary Jean Baughman, La Rose Manker, Takirah Washington and Gail Dixon. They provided love, companionship, music, wonderful meals and excellent care. Mother is now at peace and reunited with her mother, father and sister. Her dad would say, “Welcome home, Pete”.
No services will be scheduled at this time due to COVID 19. In memory of Mother, play a great hand of bridge, eat an ice cream cone, watch a football game or just do something kind for someone. If desired, donations may be made to the March of Dimes, Haven Hospice of Gainesville, FL or Trinity United Methodist Church of Gainesville, FL.

Newberry Road Newberry, FL. 32669 (352) 472-5361 www.milamfh.comStephen Nelson HulstStephen Nelson Hulst, age 69 of Newberry, FL, formerly of Miami, FL, passed away Friday January 8th, 2021. Mr. Hulst joined the presence of the Lord peacefully and at home according to his wishes. He passed with his beloved wife and family by his side. Stephen was born on November 5th, 1951 in Miami, Florida to Judith Hulst, his beloved mother.
Stephen was a Reserve Sheriff’s Deputy for the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office where he put in 20+ years of service before retiring. During his career as a deputy, Mr. Hulst also worked for Gainesville Regional Utilities, also retiring after 20+ years of working in several departments, finishing as a gas technician specialist. Being the dedicated lifelong provider of his family that he was, and never one to be idle, after “retirement” Stephen went on to serve as a Police Officer with the Santa Fe College Police Dept until he was forced to retire for health reasons.
There was little to no other activity he loved more than to roam around the beautiful Florida Keys in one of the many small Boston Whaler boats he was so fond of. He loved the simplicity and proximity to the ocean that comes with a boat such as that. It was his passion to search the emerald waters for hidden lobster or to explore the countless islands in hopes of finding something that no one else had laid eyes on since the time it was lost, being a treasure hunter at heart. Often, he would salvage old buoys and ropes that were long ago discarded and, by way of tide, made their way to become entangled in the mangroves. No matter what simple treasures he claimed, it always made him happy to be in that spot at that moment with his family by his side.
Mr. Hulst was preceded in death by his younger brother David and his mother Judy. He is survived by his beloved family, wife Olivia, daughter Rachel Hulst, three sons, Jason, David and Brant Hulst, his granddaughters Maliyah and Cheyenne, grandson Dayton, and two grandchildren, not yet born, who he would have cherished. He is also survived by his brother Carl Hulst, sister Marie Hulst and nieces and nephews.

December 11, 2020. She was born on October 17, 1921 – the sixth daughter (including Mary, Sarah,
Lydia, Annette, and Julia) and one son (Sam) born to Newberry’s then town doctor, Samuel Pace
Getzen, M.D. and his wife Mary Broughton Miller Getzen. The family prospered during Florida’s roaring
20s, and then suffered along with the entire country during the Great Depression of the 1930s selling
property they owned for $1 an acre, wearing hand-me-downs, living on local farm produce traded for
medical services, and feeding homeless people who came regularly to their doorstep.
Graduating from Newberry High School, Katharine attended Stetson University, and completed a
Bachelor’s Degree in Music from FSU (then Florida State College for Women). After graduation, she
moved to Jacksonville with sisters Annette and Julia and taught school – singing and playing the piano
in her spare time for WWII soldiers stationed at Jacksonville’s Naval Air Station. When her father died
suddenly, she moved back to Newberry to take care of her mother, and ran into a childhood friend,
Robert J. “Bobby” Barry, back from WWII and attending the University of Florida. The two fell in love
and married in a double wedding ceremony on June 1, 1947, along with Katharine’s sister Julia and her
fiancé Bruce Yongue, at the First Baptist Church of Newberry, in matching dresses made by their
mother.
Katharine and Bobby had two daughters, Katharine (Kathy) and Julianne, in the early 1950s, and resided
in Katharine’s childhood home in Newberry until building a new house in 1968 on their farm in the
Jonesville area. Katharine taught 4th grade at Newberry Elementary School for 20 years, earning her
Master’s Degree in Early Childhood Education at the University of Florida during that time. Bobby, an
active farmer/rancher, died in February 2000, at age 78.
During her lifetime, Katharine was very involved in her community – playing the piano and organ at the
First Baptist Church of Newberry for decades (following in her mother’s footsteps); giving music
lessons; playing for countless weddings, funerals, and the Newberry Watermelon Festival Beauty
Pageant; volunteering to work at high school football games, school carnivals, and innumerable church
activities. In addition to filling her house with the music of her baby grand piano and beautiful voice,
she was an excellent seamstress, cook, a creative and loving mother to her girls, and devoted wife to
Bob. She and Bob loved camping, hiking, and picnics and outings with family and friends. On her 70th
birthday, she hiked 7 miles in the Smoky mountains of North Carolina with Kathy and her family.
A beautiful woman inside and out, Katharine is survived by her younger daughter Julianne Barry
Browning and her husband Wayne Browning (of Newberry), who was a faithful, loving, and hands-on
caregiver for Katharine in her declining years. She is also survived by her daughter Katharine (Kathy)
Barry and loving son-in-law Harris Solomon (of Ft. Lauderdale), their son Barry Nicholas Solomon, his
wife Ashley, and their two children Ruby Rose and Samuel Fox (also of Fort Lauderdale).
For the past several years, Katharine required 24/7 care in her home, and the family will always be
grateful for the gentle, thoughtful and tender caregiving provided for her by Jennifer Wilson, Barbara
Tanck, Donna Metz, Sherry Gamble and Maureen Warner.
Because of the Covid virus, the funeral service will be private and limited to immediate family.
Katharine will be interred at the Newberry Cemetery beside her beloved Bobby, and her remains will
rest there among generations of family and friends. A woman of faith, her soul is already with God.
In lieu of flowers, do a kindness for someone and think of Katharine when you do it.

From her birth on October 19th, 1943 to her death on Tuesday she brightened the world around her with boundless friendship, generosity, and sincerity. She was born in Hue, the historic imperial capital of Vietnam, and entered her grandmother’s care at the age of four.
Despite the challenges facing her country she distinguished herself as a free-spirited and witty youth with a love of adventure and a thirst for new experiences. It was her intelligent, inquisitive nature that led her to work as a translator/interpreter for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and it was her wit and beauty that attracted John Swanson when he first visited the Regional USAID Office in Da Nang. Two years later Dinh and John married on August 14th, 1970 in Quang Tri City, at Province Headquarters.
The young couple then embarked on a 50-year journey that saw them living in St. Paul, MN; Columbia, MO; Springfield, VA; Cairo, Egypt; Sana’a, Yemen; Islamabad, Pakistan; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Fairfax, VA; and Gainesville, FL. Along the way she made many lifelong friends and raised a family, all while working at a variety of jobs. While living abroad she visited Kenya, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. From Gainesville, trips to Guatemala, Costa Rica, Portugal, Spain, and Cuba were special. While in Gainesville she has actively been a volunteer at Dudley Farm State Park, the Gainesville Camellia Society, and has served as a clerk during several elections. She was most proud of her work assisting Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and most content relaxing in the garden she and John built around their Gainesville home.
She is survived by her beloved husband, John, and her two children, Megan and Steven. Dinh was preceded in her death by her parents, her grandmother, and a son, Neil. She will be remembered as a vibrant, irrepressible friend to all those whose life she touched.
Because of Covid a memorial service to honor Dinh’s life will be held by Zoom at a date yet to be determined. Her charity of preference is St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital in Memphis.

Johnnie Laverne (Cook) Pennel, 76, died on November 14, 2020 at 1:30 pm at Western Missouri Medical Center, Warrensburg, Missouri from complications of COVID-19.
She was born to Simon Perry (S.P.) Cook and Nellie Mae Parkerson on December 7, 1943 in High Spring, Florida.
She married Dr. Roger L. Pennel in Warrensburg, Missouri on March 22, 1997.
She graduated from Newberry, Florida High School. But her most memorable experiences and lifelong friendships occurred in the schools in the Bronson, Florida School District, from the third Grade to her junior year of high school.
Her most memorable work experience in her early adult years was working at the Gainesville General Electric Battery Plant. She served as a lab technician, working for several Ph.D. s in this field, who were developing unique and small batteries. These batteries would later be used in medical apparatus, such as pacemakers or defibrillators. She took great pride in this work.
She was employed in an office position at the National Headquarters of Bear Archery, Gainesville, Florida. The organization not only produced top quality bow and arrows, but also sponsored world class archery teams. Under the leadership of “Papa” and “Mama” Bear the business was a “family” environment for all employees.
She was employed by J.C. Penney for approximately 15 years in Warrensburg and Sedalia, Missouri and Springfield, Virginia. She was always the “go to” person for customer service. She was especially good with elderly customers or people who were disabled. The communication process was slow, but she devoted her time to them.
She joined her husband in Washington, D.C., when he was activated for Operation Noble Eagle, after 9/11. For this one-year period she served as the unofficial “Cub Scout Master” for 100 active duty U.S. Army Reserve Criminal Investigation Special Agents. She was also the “unofficial” social director for the special agents from all units from ten states, especially during the holiday seasons. She was also the organizer for other social events, including special recognition of the hotel staff.
As a result of her military involvement, upon returning she joined the American Legion Auxiliary. She was a member of First Baptist Church, Warrensburg.
Survivors include her Husband, Roger Lee Pennel; her son Shannon Holt, Baton Rouge, LA; grandson Conner Holt (Brittany), Gainesville, FL; her great grandson Harvey Holt; stepchildren Chad (Kim) Pennel, Frisco, TX, Cara Pennel, Galveston, TX, Joshua (Liz) Pennel, Buffalo, NY, and Adam (Laylan) Pennel, Phoenixville, PA; step grandchildren Jake, Hunter, and Taylor Pennel; Madeline and Theodor Pennel and Marlowe Pennel; and sister-in-law Donna Mitchell, Joplin, MO.
Additional survivors include her stepbrother Chino (Cheryl) Hunt, Gulfport, FL and stepsister Wanda Hunt, New Smyrna Beach, FL; siblings of her grandson Cori Strickland and Cash Hiers and their mother, Paige Howard, who was a former daughter in law and lifelong friend and confidant. She leaves behind some very special friends including Trudy Sites, Warrensburg, Bobbie Maltsbarger, Warrensburg, and Beverly Morris, Sweet Springs, MO.
Although she was an only child, nobody would have known it. She was surrounded by multiple cousins who were like her siblings. These relationships lasted her entire lifetime. She is survived by a number of loving nieces and nephews and numerous cousins.
She was preceded in death by her father and mother, her oldest son Michael, and an infant baby sister.
Family and friends are invited to gather on Monday, November 23 at Sweeney-Phillips & Holdren Funeral Home in Warrensburg for visitation at 1:00 pm. A funeral service will follow at 2:00 pm.

With a sparkle in his eyes he would deliver his joyful trademark greeting: “Hi, I’m Louis. What’s your name?” This in a distinguished baritone voice that seemed to be made for radio, and which Louis cultivated early in life to help overcome a stutter. We are sad to announce that Louis Paul Kalivoda JR., loving husband, devoted father, loyal friend and dedicated community servant passed away peacefully on October 2, 2020 in his Gainesville home following a courageous struggle against a pancreatic cancer. Louis will be remembered by those who knew and loved him for his warm humor, generosity of spirit and his unshakable loyalty to family, friends, faith, community and his country. He was 71 years old. Born in Miami on May 28, 1949, Louis grew up in Palatka where his father worked for Florida Power and Light. An outstanding athlete and fi erce competitor, he was captain of the Palatka High School football team and never missed a game. “He was a moving train wreck,” recalls Louis’ boyhood friend Elliott Kane. “He attacked the lines with a recklessness that terrified opponents.” An Eagle Scout and Order Of The Arrow holder, Louis continued to work with the Boy Scouts in various volunteer capacities throughout his adult life. His two sons, Louis Paul III and Mark, also achieved Eagle Scout honors under Louis’ encouragement and tutelage. He was awarded the Scouting Silver Beaver to honor registered Scouters of exceptional character who have provided distinguished service. When he was 11-years old Louis watched the inauguration of John F. Kennedy on television, and began to develop a lifelong interest in politics and government. Recalling Kennedy’s challenge: “Let the word go forth from this time and place…that the torch has been passed to a new generation,” Kalivoda would later reflect: “I felt it was my generation he was talking about.” At the age of 15, Louis traveled to Washington, D.C. as a congressional page for then-U.S. Rep. Billy Matthews. Louis later volunteered to work for Matthews’ reelection campaign, the fi rst of many candidates he would support. He was the North Central Florida coordinator for presidential candidate Walter Mondale, and, over the course of many years, managed campaigns for such candidates as Jon Mills, George Kirkpatrick, Rod Smith, Bev Hill, Cynthia Chestnut, Perry McGriff, C. B. Daniel, David Flagg and others. “He was indefatigable,” recalls Smith, former state attorney and state senator who always turned to Louis for help on the campaign trail. “He would knock on doors, make phone calls, do whatever needed to be done.” While a congressional page, Louis attended the inauguration of Lyndon Johnson, an experience that helped propel him into a lifetime of civil rights activism. Louis would later become a board member of the Martin Luther King Jr. Commission of Florida and, in 2013, was inducted into the commission’s Hall of Fame. Louis was vice president of the student body at St. John’s River Community College before going on to the University of Florida where he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science. Choosing to remain in Gainesville he embarked on a diverse career path – first working for several years as a paramedic for the Alachua County Fire Rescue Department, then as special assistant to the city manager and, later, acting Human Resources director for the City of Gainesville. In 1986 he began a long career at Santa Fe College. Over the course of his time at SFC Louis was an instructor, counselor, lobbyist and assistant to the president. As coordinator for Santa Fe’s Institute for Criminal Justice, he was instrumental in obtaining land and funding to build the college’s Police Academy. “He was incredibly loyal, as an employee, a colleague and a friend,” recalls former Santa Fe President Larry Tyree. “He was an optimist who managed to almost always see the glass half full. I loved his positive attitude and observed it on many occasions.” Louis retired from Santa Fe in 2018 as the SFC Assistant Director, with oversight of the law enforcement, emergency medical services, and aviation programs. Despite his devotion to family, career and politics, Louis always made time in his life to give back to his community. A long-time blood donor, Louis is remembered by Life South for having made 137 donations for a total of 17 gallons. In 1990 the Gainesville Sun selected Louis over 16 other nominees for its Community Service Award, for having “performed the most outstanding and unselfish service” that year. Here is just a partial listing of the boards, organizations and causes that Louis managed to work into his life: The Corner Drug Store, the Reichert House, Citizens Crime Commission of Alachua County, Gainesville Chamber Orchestra, Community Crime and Fire Prevention Committee, Friends of Five (PBS channel 5), Statewide Task Force on Emergency Medical Services, Alachua County Girls Club, Spotlight on Youth, Girls Place, Pop Warner Football and more. Louis has been a court-appointed guardian for a Tachachale resident, and he and his wife, Carole, provided emergency shelter for children who had been victims of sexual or physical abuse. Since his retirement Louis volunteered countless hours at the Fisher House, the “home away from home” for families of patients at the VA hospital. And even as he struggled with his illness, he continued to serve on the Florida Bar Citizens Advisory Committee, in which capacity he advised the organization on how to counsel attorneys with alcohol or substance abuse problems. “He should be remembered as a generous soul who volunteered for any cause he felt worthy,” says his longtime friend Bruce Stechmiller. “Volunteering for him meant sacrifice of his time and interest. He deflected credit and praise and was more than generous giving credit to others.” An inveterate outdoorsman Louis loved to camp and hike. Founding member of the Shining Rock Orienteering Society, he led his fellow backpackers on expeditions into the Rockies, the Smokies, New Hampshire’s Mt. Washington, Blue Ridge Mountains and along many segments of the Appalachian Trail. In his younger days Louis was also a pilot and an avid skydiver. Louis is survived by his wife of 39 years Carole Ann, his 37-year old twin son and daughter Louis Paul III and Katye Kalivoda, Katye’s wife Meaghan McLaughlin, his 33-year old son Mark and his wife Jackie Pantigoso Loayza, his brother Russell Flagg and his wife Holley. Louis was a devoted Catholic. An Alter server as a child, he was a Lector at both St Augustine Parish and Holy Faith. He served on the finance committee at St Augustine for more than twenty years. In leu of flowers, the family would love donations in Louis’ name to his most cherished organizations, Gainesville’s Corner Drug Store and the Fisher House. The funeral is set for Saturday, noon at Holy Faith Catholic Church. Gator attire preferred.

We are saddened to announce that Christopher “Jay” Crooms passed away on September 20, 2020 at home surrounded by loving family. Jay was a hero and warrior but eventually succumbed to the awful disease that he fought for nearly one year. Jay was born in Savannah, Georgia on October 17, 1969 to Robert and Josie Crooms. Jay was the youngest of 4 siblings.
Jay’s family moved around a lot in his early school years in light of the fact that his dad “Coach Crooms” was a football coach. The family eventually settled in Williston, Florida where Jay graduated high school in 1988.
Jay was an avid golfer and after graduation he played golf on the Hogan Tour which eventually became the Nike Tour. Jay attended the police academy and dedicated nearly 23 years of his life to law enforcement (Department of Corrections and Levy County Sheriff’s Office). While at the sheriff’s office he wore many hats, patrol, K9, SIU and CID. In 2016 he retired as a Corporal from the Levy County Sheriff’s Office to pursue his second career and lifelong dream of following in his father’s footsteps by coaching high school football. In 2018 Jay graduated from American Military University with a Bachelors Degree in Criminal Justice with honors.
Jay coached football at Countryside Christian for 5 years and for the past 6 years he has been on the coaching staff at Williston High School.
For those of you who knew Jay personally, you know he was always the life of a party and he never met a stranger. He dedicated his entire adult life to the community of Levy County in some way shape or form. Jay was a kind soul and had a heart of gold.
He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Melinda, his daughter Madison Castaneda (William) all of Williston, FL. He also leaves behind his two sisters and a brother, Tina Maze of Athens, GA, Staci Pautler (Brent) of Sharpsburg, GA and Robert Carlton Crooms, III of Williston, FL. His loving mother Josie B. Crooms passed away November 30, 2011 and his loving father Robert Carlton Crooms, Jr. passed away September 22, 2020.

Mr. Denny’s impactful life is best appreciated for his unbridled optimism, nobility of character , and service to humanity. His genuine love of people is a constant source of inspiration and enrichment to all who knew him. A lifetime of service was instilled at an early age in the idyllic setting of Trenton, where his parents moved shortly after his birth in Carbur, FL. His father served in the trenches of France during World War I and served as Trenton City Clerk and Water System Manager for 18 years. His Mother led music and taught Sunday school for years at the United Methodist Church. The Dennys were Episcopalians, but the fact that there was no Episcopalian church in Trenton never impeded their desire to serve God and their community. Their example of service and devotion was deeply ingrained. Mr. Denny was the Trenton High School Valedictorian in 1944. Shortly after, he enlisted in the Army. Because of his astuteness, he was sent to the University of Alabama for specialized training. He completed training to fight in the Pacific at Camp Blanding, FL. Due to the Battle of the Bulge, plans changed and he was sent to Europe. He received numerous medals and distinctions and was still a teenager when the war ended. Upon returning to the United States and completing his term of duty, he enrolled in the University of Florida and graduated with a degree in Accounting. Subsequently, his professional training led to a position with the State of Florida Auditor General. He traveled the state frequently in his duties and fostered a deep love for and knowledge of his beloved state. He retired and continued to live in Tallahassee before moving to Gainesville in 2004 to the Oak Hammock Retirement Community at the University of Florida, where he was a founding member. He served in a variety of roles which included the Florida Council for the Elderly, Unit Historian for the 165th Engineer Combat Battalion, and the St. John Episcopal Church in Tallahassee. He was a member of the Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Gainesville. He was a descendent of Elias Naudain from Delaware and a proud member of the National Huguenot Society.Mr. Denny is known and loved by all for his engaging wit, sense of humor, and fondness for positive interaction. Blessed with an incredible gift of gab, conversation with Mr. Denny was always time well spent. He was an avid world traveler and visited more than eighty countries. He visited Hitler’s bombed out home in Germany, climbed the dome in Florence Italy, the pyramids in Egypt, the Parthenon in Greece, the Colosseum in Rome, even the cave where it is believed the Apostle John wrote the Book of Revelation, just to mention a few. He was an incredible source of knowledge, though modest and humble. He loved history and wrote voluminous accounts of profound observations during his fascinating life. His publication Letters from Overseas is in the Library of Congress.Mr. Denny loved laughter. He led a blessed life, and wanted everyone around him to be happy and fulfilled. He never disparaged anyone and saw the very best in everyone.
He touched so many lives in so many wonderful ways. He is survived by his adoptive family: Mr. Paul Locascio and family, whom he felt deep bonds with at church, Ms. Judy Locascio of Gainesville, Dan and Dawn Taylor, and their family of Bell, FL. He entered their lives after responding to an ad seeking World War II veterans to speak to high school students. He is deeply loved and will be greatly missed by his extended family at Oak Hammock and friendships the world over.

He was preceded in death by his proud parents William W. and Mary Elizabeth Irby.Formerly a nationally ranked, top-10 Powerlifting USA champion, Rusty would regale that far above the multitude of trophies that grace the shelves of his home, his greater successes in life were his family and the success of his students and athletes. Rusty prized his family and the friendships and adventures shared together.Rusty was born at Alachua General Hospital and enjoyed a fortunate youth in his hometown of Alachua. Rusty excelled in sports at an early age and distinguished himself as an athlete at Santa Fe High School. He was a graduate of the University of Florida and earned his Master’s Degree from Nova University.Rusty was an avid outdoorsman and travel enthusiast. Early in his adult life he explored Alaska and the American West extensively and was usually accompanied by his ever faithful dog, “Lefty.” Together they hiked the wilderness trails of the Rockies and fished the wild streams of the Great Northwest.Rusty’s teaching, coaching and school administration career spanned nearly thirty years, serving Alachua, Marion, Hernando and Sumter Counties. Many of his stellar athletes recollect fondly the “rock solid” character of Rusty’s “firm but fair” approach to education and athletic training. His high school weightlifting teams were regularly recognized for their winning spirit and accomplishments. Rusty Irby was a coach among coaches and a team builder, motivating the least talented as much as those more athletically gifted to achieve their personal best.Later in life Rusty enjoyed the serenity of the Irby family’s mountain place above Penrose, NC. His greater delight was on the Gulf, off Shired Island, where he first learned from his father to fish and appreciate all of God’s creation and to always leave things better than you found them.Due to restrictions and cautions concerning the current pandemic, a private memorial is to be held. In this light, the family has appreciated yet more all the kind words of condolence and remembrance received.

every boy”. She was generous with her time, and volunteered for many years in a

Eagle Helpers and Meals on Wheels. Pat was a thirty-six year snowbird in Lake Placid,
Florida where she enjoyed many lifelong friends, volunteering, golfing, walking and
bicycling and enjoying the winter sunshine. She was an accomplished baker and
shared her coveted peanut butter and snickerdoodle cookies. Her ready smile and kind
words will be sorely missed by many of all ages. One of Pat’s greatest joys was the
love of her family and her proudest achievement was her role as Mother to six fortunate

Gibbs, MDCharles P. Gibbs MD passed away on June 25, 2020 surrounded by his loving family under the care of Haven Hospice in Gainesville, FL following a courageous battle with cancer.
“Charlie” was born in Ft. Wayne, IN on January 3, 1936 to Paul and Florence Gibbs. He graduated from Southside High School and later received his Bachelor’s degree from Indiana University. On August 23rd, 1958 he married his high school sweetheart, Margaret.He then went on to attend medical school and complete his OB/GYN residency at IU while Margaret supported them working as a nurse. He left Indiana to pursue a gynecology oncology surgical fellowship at the Mayo Clinic. By this time his three sons, Parker, Eric and Gordon had been born and the family moved to Florida where Charlie served in the US Air Force for two years before moving to Miami to complete a second residency, this time in Anesthesiology. Because one residency is never enough… Charlie completed his academic training as an NIH research fellow at the Nuffield Institute for Medical Research in Oxford, England in 1972.
In the summer of 1972 the family moved back to Florida and put down roots in Gainesville, a town that became a special place for Charlie and Margaret. It was here that they made lifelong friends and raised their three sons. Gainesville was also where Charlie began his long and distinguished career as an academic obstetrical anesthesiologist, continuing his pioneering work on preventing the risks of anesthesia in pregnancy. He eventually served as the UF College of Medicine’s Assistant Dean for Curriculum. The work week was long but the weekends were devoted to his family and friends and most were spent on the boat or playing golf.
In 1986 Charlie and Margaret moved to Denver, CO where Charlie took the position of Chair of the Department of Anesthesia at the University of Colorado. He led that department driving education, research and clinical excellence until his retirement in 2002. It was here that he and Margaret enjoyed being empty nesters and discovered the joy of the mountains and mountain golf. During his long career, Charlie was recognized often for his leadership and scientific acumen serving on numerous editorial boards and in leadership positions. He served as the president of the Alachua County Medical Society, the Florida Society of Anesthesiologists, the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology and the Society of Academic Anesthesia Chairs. Despite his many professional accomplishments, he was probably best known for his wonderful personality and kind hearted treatment of others. It was abundantly clear he derived the most joy from being a loving husband, father and grandfather.
Following his retirement, Charlie and Margaret moved back to Gainesville to be close to family and friends. Margaret passed away after 56 years of marriage in 2014 after a long and hard-fought battle with Alzheimer’s. Despite losing his high school sweetheart, he never lost his optimism and love for life. Over the next several years he continued to enjoy his grandchildren and play golf with his boys while he worked part-time in the UF Department of Anesthesiology. During this time he met a wonderful and exceptional woman, Sara Lynn McCrea who became his loving wife on April 27, 2019. Together, they weathered the storm of his final illness.
Charlie is survived by his wife, Sara Lynn, his three children: Parker (Micaela), of Gainesville, FL, Eric (Lauren) of Orlando, FL, and Gordon (Gina) of Ormond Beach, FL and his stepson Bill of Gainesville, FL He is also survived by his five loving grandchildren: Eric, Jr.(Sarah), Stephen, Caroline, Alexandra and Jillian and his aging pup, Beauty.A private celebration of life is being planned by the family. They ask in lieu of flowers donations be made in Charlie’s name to either the Lady Gator Golf Boosters or Ronald McDonald House Charities of North Central Florida.

She was born on November 29, 1933 in the borough of the Bronx in New York City. Her parents we Oscar Hausler and Justina Wellauer Hausler, who had migrated to the United States from Germany in the late 1920s.
Speaking little English, Mary began her formal education at P.S. 53. She was a high achiever and graduated valedictorian of her class. Encouraged by her teachers, Mary took the entrance examination for Hunter College High School and received the second highest grade of all participants. Hunter provided Mary with the finest secondary school education and opened her life to the cultural arts, which New York City provided in abundance.
After receiving her bachelor’s degree from Queens College of the City University of New York in 1955, Mary began her teaching career in the newly established Syosset Central School District on Long Island. She earned her master’s degree at QC and after completing additional courses at St. John’s and Fordham Universities, Mary was certified to teach elementary grades K-8 and secondary school social studies as well as to serve as secondary school principal. During her tenure in Soyosset, Mary taught for several years and was appointed dean of students. She became the assistant principal and then principal of H.B. Thompson Middle School. She retired from the Syosset schools in 1992 and worked as a supervisor of student teachers at Southampton College on Long Island for two semesters before moving to Connecticut.
In 1966, Mary was granted a sabbatical to observe and report on the teaching of social studies in schools of Austria and Germany. Her knowledge of German was a prerequisite for this study. From January through August of 1966, Mary followed a prearranged schedule to visit German and Austrian schools. During school breaks she was able to travel to other countries with two Eurail passes, which allowed for six months of travel in first class train cars and compartments. Visits to Spain, Portugal, France, Denmark, all the Scandinavian countries, Italy and the former Czechoslovakia and Soviet Union were on her itinerary. Mary’s love for travel and new experiences was enhanced by these opportunities and continued throughout her life.
Mary was married to Syosset colleague Albert Traversa, a science teacher and department head, who retired in 1986. While still working, Mary and Albert traveled with a trailer throughout the United States. A favorite trip was trailering from New York to California and back during a summer vacation. In their retirement years, Mary and Albert traveled Europe, especially in Germany and Italy where they each had relatives. They also enjoyed visits to China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Australia and New Zealand. Their last trip together was a cruise from Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires.
Mary and Albert left Long island in 1993, moved to a condo in Southbury, Connecticut and also acquired a condo in Boca Raton, Florida. They traveled between the two homes for twelve years. In 2005 the retirees sought a permanent home in Florida. They found an ideal setting at Oak Hammock at the University of Florida, where they spent almost fourteen happy years together. Sadly, Albert died on January 11, 2019 at the age of 90.
Mary is survived by her sister Loretta Newman, nephew Michael Newman, his wife Mirella and their two children, niece Laura Kupinski, cousins Birgit Fries and Monika Schafer in Germany, Albert’s children Maria and Leo Traversa, Albert’s sister Sylvia and her husband Bernard Cecire and dear friends Carol Kravetz, Catherine Morsink, and Gail McVicker.
It was Mary’s wish that she be cremated and that the urn with her ashes be placed in the niche with Albert’s urn at Florida National Cemetery in Bushnell, FL, and that the inscription “Together Forever” be inscribed on the marker. Theirs was truly an everlasting love.

Mary Alice fought with all that she had over the last several years to reach her 21st actual birthday on Leap Day.
Mary Alice was born on February 29, 1936 to Joseph and Myrtle Jennings in New Boston, Ohio. In 1954, she graduated from Glenwood High School, New Boston, Ohio. After Graduation, Mary Alice moved to Gainesville, Florida where she worked for the UF Library System. In 1959, she was introduced to the love of her life, Allan. Shortly after they were introduced, he asked her “How much longer do you think we should wait before we get married?” They eloped soon after and planned a formal wedding a few months later. Her main focus in life was her family. She would remain silent about things which bothered her in order to support those she loved. Before her last two children were born, she worked for the Alachua County Clerk of the Court as a Judicial Secretary and Clerk. She also worked for Shands Hospital in an administrative role. She moved to Titusville, Florida shortly before the birth of her second child. She returned to Gainesville, Florida shortly before the birth of her third child. After the birth of her second child, she devoted her time to her family. She volunteered in the Alachua County School System once all her children were in school. When her youngest child reached middle school age, she began working for the School Board of Alachua County. She worked tirelessly to do what she could to support the Alachua County School System, both as a volunteer and employee until her retirement in 2001.
She was an avid Gator fan and loved all sports. For many years she was a member of the Gator Town Gators, the Tip-Off Club and the Dug-Out Club. She attended all football, basketball and baseball games for many years. She also enjoyed going to gymnastic and volleyball events. Her presence at the stadiums decreased over the last few years, but her love for sports did not. She spent most of her weekend watching whatever sports she could, especially the Gators, on the television.
In the last several years, she spent all her time with the love of her life, Allan. Even though he was still working, she spent her days sitting in the corner of his office. She was an avid reader and spent most of her time on her tablet either reading a book or playing games. She was the happiest when surrounded by her family.
She was a force to be reckoned with and if she got tired of a conversation with someone, she would look at them and say, “That’s a Rhett Butler to me.” She cared very deeply for those she met through her work and private life.
Her memory lives on in her husband of 60+ years, Allan, her daughters, Melanie Baer Peters and Jennifer Baer Ervin (Bruce), both of Gainesville, her three grandchildren, James “Jimmy” L. Earnhart II (Alexis) of Gainesville, Elizabeth “Lizzie” D. Murrell (Justin) of Sparks, GA, Kathryn “Katy” M. Peters of Gainesville, her three great-grandchildren, Morgan L. Earnhart, Mary J. Earnhart and Brooke R. Earnhart all of Gainesville as well as her sister-in-law, Gracia Baer, a niece, Gerri Corson (Hal), and three nephews, Guy Campbell (MaryBeth), Gray Campbell, and Glen Baer (Norma).
She was preceded in death by her parents, her older sister, Betty Taylor, her oldest daughter, Alyson B. Mogan, and a niece, Genie Campbell.
Due to the medical crisis in our country at this time and the inability to gather in large groups the family has decided to hold a memorial service at a later date. When a memorial service can be planned a second notice will be placed in the paper.

Born on April 8, 1932, Bobbie grew up in the tight-knit small-town community of Cramerton, North Carolina. Following Bobbie’s graduation from the Mayworth School in 1949, where she played basketball on her high school team, she married her childhood sweetheart, Bob, on February 25, 1951. Soon thereafter Bobbie and Bob began filling their home with the sounds of the little feet of Kim, Jan and Myra. In 1960, the young Eller family moved to Gainesville, Florida where Bob’s employer transferred him. In 1962, the Eller family grew by one with the arrival of their youngest daughter, Nancy. The now family of six soon established deep roots in Gainesville and the parish of Holy Trinity Episcopal Church. Once the children were a little older, Bobbie attended Santa Fe College and began working at the University of Florida in 1967. She initially was employed in an administrative role with the College of Education’s Department of Elementary Education and then with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences’ Department of Psychology. Bobbie subsequently joined the College of Medicine’s Department of Orthopaedics where she worked as the department’s administrator until she retired in 1997.
Bobbie never met a stranger. She was a “mother” to many and a friend to all. She believed there could not be too many children around for that would be like saying there could not be too many flowers. Nanna was her name and spoiling was definitely her game. But, when not hugging on little ones, Bobbie loved church activities, slow dancing with her beloved Bob, line-dancing and square-dancing with friends, shopping, playing cards, cruising the Caribbean, hitting the slots at the casino, and sharing her wonderful pound cakes and fudge. Her keen sense of humor, especially her ability to laugh at herself, her never-wavering support of those she loved, her steadfast faith in God, her heartfelt belief that her family was the best family in the whole world, her infectious optimism, and her impeccable Southern-lady sense of style will be sorely missed, but always remembered.
In accordance with Bobbie’s wishes there will be no funeral service. If led to, please consider a donation to Haven Hospice, 4200 NW 90th Blvd, Gainesville, FL 32606, as they exemplified for both Bob and Bobbie that the end of life deserves as much comfort, respect, dignity and loving care as the beginning.

She had a long battle with respiratory problems which ultimately led to severe pneumonia. She died peacefully knowing she was surrounded bedside by her most loved ones.
Lolin was born in Barcelona, Spain, December 8, 1926. She grew up and had a memorable childhood in Barcelona, where her father owned a school academy and her grandfather would take her on fun adventures. Her family used to vacation in the Catalan Pyrenees’ town of Seu d’Urgell and that is where she met the love of her life, Bienvenido Miralles. She attended school in Barcelona where she received her degree in obstetrics and married Bienvenido at the age of 21. Shortly thereafter, they fled Spain to avoid the Civil War and moved to Caracas, Venezuela. In Venezuela, Bienvenido started a rubber factory and Lolin decided she wanted to teach. She loved children of all ages and teaching fulfilled that need she had to interact with them. She was so good at her job that many students often would show up at her house saying they wanted to move in with her and she was named “Teacher of the Year” almost every one of the 25 years she worked in academics.
Lolin belonged to many different social and sports clubs in Venezuela, where she was always involved in organizing parties and social events. Her love of life and people made her one of the most liked and loved people within her social circles. Wherever Lolin went she was always the life of the party; she loved laughing, dancing, traveling, and entertaining others with her stories. She loved music and was an avid piano player; she would play sardanas and pasodobles and instantly light up a room. In 1976, Bienvenido and Lolin moved to Miami, where their daughter Marlin played tennis and went to school. In 1986, they moved to Gainesville.
Lolin lived her life to the fullest and was blessed to have a fairytale love story with Bienvenido. After 50 years of marriage, they still walked side by side holding hands. She was an amazing wife and friend to Bienvenido, a loving daughter to her parents Jose and Carolina, a wonderful sister to Marta and Jose Maria, an exceptional mother to Marlin, and a sweet and fun grandma to her grandchildren Erik and Kyle, whom she loved unconditionally. She loved her friends and spending quality time with them was very important to her. She wanted to be remembered for all her stories and for the times she made people smile.
She is survived by her sister Marta Puig, her daughter Marlin Nipper, her grandchildren Erik and Kyle Nipper, her nieces Heike Herrmann and Mila Wallace, and her nephew Cruxen Puig. She is preceded in death by her parents Jose Puig and Carolina Roca de Puig, her brother Jose Maria Puig, and her husband Bienvenido Miralles.
Funeral services will be held at 2 pm, Saturday January 4, 2020 at Milam Funeral Home Chapel, 311 South Main Street in Gainesville. The services will include a celebration of life and the floor will be open to anyone who would like to share a thought, story, or memory of Lolin. Burial will follow at Forest Meadows Memorial Park, 4100 NW 39th Avenue, where she will find her final resting place next to her beloved Bienvenido.
The family would like to express thanks to the ICU team at North Florida Regional Medical Center for their excellent care, understanding, and compassion; and to Milam Funeral Home, in particular to Ashley Milam for her friendship, help, and amazing ability to help us through this difficult transition with so much love and patience.

Living through the Great Depression as a young girl, she developed an innate character that was very generous and thoughtful of others. She demonstrated the characteristics of the “Greatest Generation”. Edith chose to look on the positive side of life and the challenges that life brought. She loved to travel; play golf, tennis, and bridge; garden, fish, and scallop; and truly loved her time spent with family and friends. She was a member of the Chi Omega Sorority , the Gainesville Golf and Country Club , the 10Gs golf group, the Jocanters, the Skippers, the Gainesville Garden Club, the Viktors Investment Club, Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, and the Gainesville Offshore Fishing Club.Edith was born in Canon, GA, on February 10, 1924.

After marriage, Edith and John lived in Memphis, TN, and Ottumwa, lowa, while John worked for Hull Dobbs Ford Agency. A family business opportunity brought them to Gainesville, FL, where Edith worked at Watson and Ellett Insurance, which later became known as Ellett Insurance.

In 2004, Edith and John sold their home at Paynes Prairie to son, Ed, and wife, Marcia, and moved to Oak Hammock at The University of Florida as founding members. John passed away on his birthday, on December 23, 2009, and Edith eventually moved to Assisted Living. She enjoyed spending time with long-time friend and neighbor, Bill Enneking.

On Monday, October 14, 2019,
the world, my family and our
newspaper lost an amazing
mother, grandmother, wife of
43 years, and kind-but-tough
businesswoman.
Our Publisher Constance
Davis Rowe passed quietly into
the arms of our heavenly father
surrounded by her family.
Mrs. Rowe, or Connie as she was
known to her friends, fought like
the true trooper she was for the
last days of her life, leaving behind
her two loving sons, James Ben
and Michael Andrew, daughterin-law Caron Rowe, grandsons
Clayton and Chase, and
granddaughters Brittany and
Kaycee Rowe. (Plus many
brothers, sisters, nieces &
nephews who loved her deeply
as well). The details surrounding
her passing will be kept private
as she would have wished,
but it was entirely natural.
Constance started out her adult
life as a Registered Nurse, hailing
from my hometown of Huntington,
W.Va. From there, she met Benny
Rowe of Lexington KY at Marshall
University when Benny saved a
woman from burning to death
when he was a paperboy. J.
Ben was the love of her life and
they were married for 43 years
having three rowdy boys together,
James, Michael and Matthew,
who passed tragically in 2003.
Mrs. Rowe was very kind
and sweet, but a hard-nosed
businesswoman who no one
dared tread on. Together with two
other employees, she and I ran
The Record for many years after J.
Ben’s passing in 2005. She kept
daddy’s dream alive all these years,
working tirelessly at the business
until about one month ago. (I
never had any idea just how much
momma actually handled until
now.) Sorting through the finances
and records of transactions, I am
just a little overwhelmed at how
much she actually did to keep
The Record’s lifeblood pumping.
As of presstime, we do not
have the final details of when the
service will be, but tentatively
Friday October 18th or Saturday
the 19th at Milam Funeral Home
at 311 South Main Street in
Gainesville FL. Friends may
call the office later in week or
check obits in the daily paper for
more accurate times and dates.
I’m sure mom is watching over
us, I don’t know exactly how I
know, but have a feeling at times
when certain things happen she
is reaching down to guide me.
In the words of a great song,
“You can tear a building down, but
you can’t erase the memories.”
Goodbye momma, you will never
know how much you meant to
us nor how much we Love and
miss you. Anne Bronson IszardAnne Bronson Iszard, was born on November 22nd, 1942 in Waterbury, Connecticut. Neighbors near the family home in Roxbury included the renowned sculptor of mobiles, Alexander Calder, who would often drop in for a cocktail with Anne’s father. The converted ‘party barn’ later featured in Architectural Digest. A teenage Anne and a friend encountered another neighbor, Arthur Miller, going into the village, and he sent them up the drive for a poolside chat with his wife, Marilyn Monroe, who proved to be both charming and beautiful. Anne came from a distinguished, old New England family, some of whose portraits were painted by John Singer Sargent. Her 4th-great-grandfather was a U.S. Senator for New York in 1803. And her cousin, General Jonathan Wainwright, was Commander of Allied Forces in the Philippines during World War Two.
In 1965, Anne volunteered with the Vista organization and spent a year, assisting migrant workers near Delray Beach, where she lived with an African-American family, strengthening her lifelong attitude of tolerance and acceptance of others, including her late brother, Peter, who was gay at a time when this was not openly acceptable. Her career took her from media consultant in Boston to a secretarial position in Gainesville before her retirement. After a lengthy encounter with dementia, she finally succumbed to colon cancer on September 26th, 2019. She is survived by her elder brother, Toby, of Rockport, Texas, nieces Beth and Cyd, and nephew Jon. Her ashes are to be buried with those of Peter in the family plot in Roxbury.

Cody was born in Gainesville, Florida on July 13th 1992. He spent most of his life in Gainesville and Windsor, Florida.
Cody attended Hawthorne High School and then completed his senior year at the Florida Youth Academy located at Camp Blanding in Starke, Florida. After graduation Cody decided to follow his passion, welding. He then attended Tulsa Welding School, located in Jacksonville Florida. Upon graduation he then traveled to Missouri and then to Oklahoma and landed once again, where his heart was, in Florida. He was a self-employed welder.
Cody had a passion for life. He never met a stranger. He didn’t have acquaintances, he had friends for life. Under the grease and grime that he usually had on him, there was an honest, loyal, happy, do anything for you kind of guy. I used to think it was those baby blue eyes that he was able to get whatever he wanted but, it was actually the kind and beautiful soul he had. Cody enjoyed anything outdoors from mud holes, riding in the woods to fishing and hunting.

Our mother was born November 8.1924, to Dora and Abe Sotnick nearly two hours before her beloved twin sister, Esther. The youngest of five girls including an older set of twins, she was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio.
The Sotnicks were a strong political family and passed their values to all five daughters. As a result, she developed a strong passion for activism both on a local and federal level. In 1946, Elaine and Esther made a trek to Gainesville, Florida, to visit a sister, Meriam , and brother-in-law who was stationed at Camp Blanding. It was in Gainesville she met the love of her life, Irvin “Yitzi” Robbins…and it only took five dates for her to accept his proposal of marriage. Reluctantly, she left the big city life Cleveland offered to settle in a small southern town in North Florida.
Not to say she wasn’t madly in love with her new husband and happily looking forward to a wonderful future, but she often lamented about her love of the big city and likened small town Gainesville to a “25 watt bulb.” But, she settled in with her new husband and together became life partners in marriage and business. As business partners, they worked hard to successfully open businesses well known to this day to the community. Along with the rest of the Robbins brothers, this included the Rose Theatre, the Robbins Department Store in Starke, Fl, The Personality Shop, the L&L/Stag and Drag, which were run by Irvin’s older brothers, Alex, and Leon, and the legendary Gator Shop
In addition to their business ventures, Elaine and Irvin were pillars of the Gainesville Jewish Community serving in many capacities at B’nai Israel Synagogue. Along with the rest of the Robbins family, they spent many years in leadership capacities devoting themselves to the growth of the synagogue.
One could say Elaine was one of the first feminists actively joined in protests against the Viet Nam War, Civil Rights, and women’s rights. She was a strong independent women who raised strong independent children, who raised strong independent children.
Included in her passions was the love of animals One could always find at least two pets among the family whom she had the uncanny ability of humanizing and treating as if they were her children..(they were). Her talents also included making magnificent needlepoint and bargello pillows, and baking the best cheesecakes ever!
After 62 years of marriage, Irvin preceded Elaine in death along with her parents, Dora and Abe Sotnick, her sisters Sanna Deutchman, Meriam Rosen, Mona Cramer, and her daughter-in-law Ornah Becker Robbins.
She leaves behind her loving twin sister Esther Sobo, her children Jane Robbins, Dale Robbins, Dr. Marc Robbins and her granddaughters, Alison Robbins, Abby Robbins, Maya Robbins and many many nieces and nephews whom she dearly loved.
While a beautiful light was dimmed today, her legacy of joy and passion will live on with her loving family.Graveside Services will be held at B’Nai Israel Cemetery, Monday, September 23, 2019 at 11 a.m. For those who wish, contributions may be made to Congregation B’Nai Israel 3830 NW 16th Blvd, Gainesville, FL 32605Arrangements are in the care of MILAM FUNERAL AND CREMATION SERVICES, 311 South Main Street, Gainesville FL 32601, 352 376 5361 www.milamfh.comDan AlfordDan Alford, of Gainesville, FL passed away peacefully at his home on Tuesday, September 17th after a short battle with pancreatic cancer.He was born in Dothan, Alabama on November 12, 1954.

York Hospice Care Center in Gainesville. Ashoke was born on October 30, 1930 in Kolkata, India to Manoj Mohan Banerji and Protima Banerji. Ashoke’s family was originally from Uttarpara, a suburb of Kolkata. However, he grew up in Cuttack, where his dad was a professor of Electrical Engineering. Ashoke attended Stewart School and Ravenshaw College at Cuttack before being admitted to the Indian School of Mines (ISM), the premier mining engineering school in India. He graduated in 1952 and worked for the Coal Board until 1973 when the coal industry was nationalized. He later attended Newcastle University in the UK and graduated in 1968 with Master of Science in Mining Engineering. He taught as a Visiting Professor in the Metallurgical Engineering Department at Jadavpur University from 1969-1970. He retired as Chief General Manager in Mine Safety from Coal India Limited in 1988. He was a senior member of the ISM Alumni Association, as well as the Mining and Metallurgical Institute of India (MGMI). Ashoke lived during significant historical times. He was 17 when India gained her independence from British rule. He witnessed the freedom struggle at the grassroots level such as the calls by Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose and others to boycott foreign goods and promote India’s path to self-determination. He belonged to the inaugural class of a school started by a freedom fighter where the medium of instruction was Bangla, the indiginous langauge of the region. The school was short-lived as the founder and the only teacher was arrested in front of his students and taken away by British police. He also lived through the World War II period as the British were still ruling India at that time. When he attended Newcastle University, he witnessed the visit of Martin Luther King Jr. who was awarded an honorary degree – the only UK university to do so during his lifetime. During his time in England, he also experienced the musical revolution of the times with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Monkees. Ashoke had a variety of interests and hobbies. He was an avid reader, photographer, and a traveller. He was particularly a lover of Rabindranath Tagore’s works and followed some of the philosophical principles expressed in those works in his personal life.

York Hospice Care Center in Gainesville. She was born on May 12, 1942 in Los Angeles, California to Miriam and Albert Chamberlain. Her mother remarried when Lee was 8 years old to Milton Young at the end of his naval career. The family later moved to his hometown of Gouldsboro, Maine which is on the coast in the “down east” area. Lee lived on the ocean and as a child enjoyed the beauty of Maine, the pleasant summers and the winter activities. They spent many holidays with her beloved Grandmother in New York City. Lee attended 2 years of public high school at Hancock County High School and 2 years of boarding school at Mount Mercy Academy at Waterville, Maine. She then attended the University of Maine at Machias. Lee’s college career ended one exciting spring break in Ft. Lauderdale while visiting her Grandmother. She met a wonderful Georgia Tech student and followed him to Atlanta with $40 in her pocket. However, within three days she had a good job with a major insurance company as a claims correspondent. The transition from rural Maine to Atlanta was exciting and she enjoyed her new independence. Lee married Wallace H. Smith on June 6, 1963, the day of his graduation from Georgia Tech. She continued work while Wally completed his Master’s Degree. Upon graduation, Wally accepted a job with IBM and they moved to Jacksonville in 1966. Lee accepted a job with Xerox Corporation. Wally and Lee purchased a home and she was active in the community. She served in her church, was a Board Member of The Children’s Horne Society volunteered at Baptist Memorial Hospital and worked as a fund raiser for St. Vincent’s Hospital. Lee enjoyed Jacksonville and especially boating on the St. Johns River and in the ocean. Shortly after their marriage, Lee was reunited with her natural Father after nearly 20 years. After her parents were divorced in California, her Father bought a yacht and entered the chartering business. He later settled at Staniel Cay, a small island in the Exumas about 80 miles southeast of Nassau. Lee was excited; but, a little nervous to see him again. Lee and her father reestablished a bond and she visited him at this beautiful island regularly. Lee was lucky to have a father in the Bahamas and a step father in Maine that loved her dearly. She also had the best of both worlds with such lovely places to visit. A beautiful daughter, Katherine Lee Smith, was born on April 30, 1968 to Wally and Lee at Baptist Memorial Hospital. She was bright, small, and very feminine and brought great joy to their lives. Lee balanced raising a child with work and also continued her volunteer activities. The following year brought tragedy to Lee. On November 16, 1969 Wally was involved in a boating accident and drowned. Her friends and the Smith family, including Wally’s parents, three sisters and four brothers, rallied to her in this time of tragedy. At the time of this loss, Lee was pregnant with her son who was born at Baptist Memorial Hospital on May 10, 1970 which was a special Mother’s Day present! He was bright, large, very masculine and the image of his father.  He also brought great joy to Lee. Lee’s friends were a great source of strength and helped in her attempts to provide a normal life to two small children while grieving the tragic loss of her husband. In June of 1971, Lee started a new direction in her life. She sold her home in Jacksonville and on June 5, 1971 married David K. Crapps who was a friend and fraternity brother of Wally. He isone of ten children and now the children were blessed with lots of new relatives as well as the joys from the many they already had. During their first year of marriage, the family survived David’s serious auto accident as well as a large fire in their home. During her second year of marriage her husband quit his job and entered the University of Florida for his Ph.D. Four and one-quarter years later, he started a consulting business on borrowed money.  Their marriage survived and life was great!  They later bought a place on the water in Prospect Harbor, Maine close to her childhood home.  Lee enjoyed the summers in Maine for over 25 years. Lee loves her children, Kathy and Wally, and is so proud of their accomplishments. Her main goals have been to encourage them to obtain the necessary education and to participate in leadership roles in their church, school and community so that they would be prepared to contribute to society. Kathy graduated from Rollins College and soon thereafter received two Master’s Degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Kathy is married to Robert Hatcher and now lives in Houston, Texas (Clay Hatcher and Kelly Hatcher – children through marriage).  Wally graduated from the University of Notre Dame, earned a Master’s Degree at the University of Florida and a Master of Business from Michigan State University.  Wally is married to Betsy and has three children:  Katherine, David and John.  Lee loved her grandchildren dearly. Lee always felt that she had a small part in Kathy and Wally’s achievements. She did the usual carpooling and was a very active volunteer at their schools. Lee was also active at theAlachua county Boy’s Club serving on the Board of Directors for several years and the Buchholtz Quarterback club serving as Concessions Chairman for the Varsity and JV teams and many other school related activities. Lee was active in her community in other ways, serving on the Church Council at Holy Faith Catholic Church and served as an Eucharistic Minister for over 30 years. She was a volunteer at Alachua General Hospital and active in the Junior League of Gainesville. While in the Junior League, she was on the Board of Directors serving as Secretary, Admissions Chairman, Follies Ads Chairman and Follies Ticket Chairman as well as other League Projects. Lee was a Sustainer in the Junior League. Lee took great pride in being a member of P.E.O.  Lee enjoyed walking, reading, travel, spending time with her husband, helping others, and visiting with friends and family. Lee has maintained a good relationship with her children, their spouses and grandchildren. Lee was active at Holy Faith Church in Gainesville, FL and Birch Harbor Baptist Church in Birch Harbor, ME.  There will be a funeral service for Lee at Holy Faith Church on Friday July 26, 2019 at 9:30 am, followed by a Celebration of Life in Maine (date to be announced) followed by burial at the Prospect Harbor Cemetery in Maine.Elizabeth “Beth” Hughes GriffisElizabeth (Beth) Hughes Griffis went to be with her Lord on July 14th, 2019.

82. Bob was a devoted husband to his wife Beverly (Tyre) Singer. They were happily married
for 37 years. He is also survived by step-son Lance (Tina) Johnson and two grandchildren, Asher
and Addrey Johnson, as well as one brother Neal (Jill) of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Bob was
one-of-a-kind, and ate life with both hands. Family and friends will remember him as caring,
compassionate, and gregarious. He would brighten any room with his warm presence,
lightning-quick wit, and endearing sense of humor.
Bob attended Brooklyn College, beginning in
1954. His studies were put on hold when he
voluntarily enlisted in the US Army during the
Korean War, serving from 1955-1958. He was
honorably discharged, and returned to Brooklyn

the Brooklyn College basketball team. He
graduated in 1961 with his B.S., went on to
complete his M.S. at Penn State University in 1962,
and his Ph.D. from Ohio State University in 1964.
Bob then served on the faculty of several
universities, including a 17-year tenure at Florida
State University. He moved to the University of
Florida in 1987, where he served as Chair of the
Department of Exercise and Sport Sciences for the
next 15 years, during which time he led the
department to international prominence.
Bob’s accomplishments as a scholar, leader, teacher, and mentor are legendary. He will be
remembered as a true pioneer in the fields of motor learning and sport psychology. His
research focused on understanding cognitive processes and learning strategies involved in skill
acquisition, expert performance, and the development of expertise. He was a prolific
researcher – having published 17 books, over 200 research, scientific, and professional articles,
and 25 book chapters over his remarkable career. His extensive and timeless scholarly
contributions are perhaps best exemplified by two seminal books, Motor learning and human
performance: An application to physical education skills, published in 1968, and the Handbook
of Research on Sport Psychology, published in 1993. Both were landmark contributions that
served to advance the related fields of motor learning and sport psychology – in substance and
respectability – in ways that cannot be overstated. His more than three dozen former Ph.D.
students who have carried Bob’s influence throughout the world as faculty members and
practitioners will fondly remember Bob as a firm yet gentle, inspiring, and dedicated mentor.
Bob was a selfless, tireless, and innovative servant leader in the field of sport psychology.
Among other influential leadership positions, Bob served as Head of the Sport Psychology
Division of the Sports Medicine Committee of the United States Olympic Committee, President
of the Division of Exercise and Sport Psychology of the American Psychological Association,
President of the American Academy of Kinesiology and Physical Education, and President of
the International Society of Sport Psychology. Bob was actively involved in international
developments and the advancement of sport psychology through his enormous international
network of friends and colleagues, as reflected in the nearly 400 presentations he made in
more than 50 countries during his career. Bob highly valued the opportunity to apply his
scholarly expertise to the benefit of others, and served as a skilled consultant to athletes and
coaches across many sports. His reputation extended beyond sports, to other areas of
expertise. For example, when President Reagan was shot, the head of his detail called upon
Bob’s expertise in the psychological factors underlying movement automaticity during the
investigation. Never one to seek recognition for his accomplishments, Bob was nonetheless
highly decorated for his incredible impact. Among other awards, he received the inaugural
award for Distinguished Contributions to the Science of Exercise of Sport and Exercise
Psychology from the American Psychological Association, the Distinguished International Sport
Psychology award from the International Society of Sport Psychology, and the Distinguished
Scholar award from the North American Society for the Psychology of Sport and Physical
Activity.
In addition to dedicating his life to studying the psychology of sport and physical activity, Bob
practiced what he preached. He was a two sport athlete at Brooklyn College, where he played
both baseball and basketball. He was particularly fond of racquet sports, however, and was an
accomplished tennis and badminton player. Bob was a generous supporter of, and ambassador
for the performing arts. As a leader in the field of kinesiology, Bob had a natural affinity for
dance, and was a champion of storytelling through the art of movement. Fittingly, memorial
donations in Bob’s name (and in lieu of flowers) can be made to the University of Florida
Performing Arts, made out the UF Foundation Inc., Fund 4437, and sent to P.O. Box 14425,

It was her gift which she shared with many people during her lifetime. When Frank was given assignment to Taiwan, she packed up the family and they all lived in Taiwan until Frank was sent back to the Jacksonville Naval Air Station to complete his career in the NavyOnce her children were grown, Hazel turned her attention to activities that gave her an outlet for her boundless energy and love for people.

She loved greeting visitors to the shop and helping sort donations. Last, but certainly not least, Hazel loved to garden. Her yard was her passion.

Stringfellow (Karla), Douglas Alexander Stringfellow (Robbie), daughter Martha Murphree Stringfellow York, (Guy) and seven grandchildren: Alex, Andrew, Hart, and Celeste Stringfellow, and James, William and Sarah York.
Born November 4, 1933, Jim was a lifelong resident of Gainesville and fourth generation descendent of one of Alachua County’s early pioneer families, that began with his great grandfather, Dr. William Hall Stringfellow, one of Gainesville’s first physicians and who was the first speaker at the 1852 meeting that saw a vote to locate the county seat to Gainesville.
Jim was a leader from an early age. He attended P.K. Young which in 2006 honored him as a Distinguished Graduate. He continued his education at the University of Florida where he played the violin in the UF Symphony, was on the UF Tennis team and served two years ROTC graduating in 1955 with a B.S. in marketing.
He went on to serve four years as a navigator in the U.S. Air Force retiring in 1959 with the rank of Captain.
Jim returned to Gainesville and became partner in Stringfellow Supply Company, a building materials business started by his grandfather. During this career he served as president of the National Building Material Distributors Association.
While running a successful business, Jim made time for his passions: helping children, improving health care and enhancing the Gainesville area’s quality of life.
His early community service included chairing the Gainesville Airport Advisory board 12 times, leading the team that built the first control tower, hired the first airport manager, developed the first airport master plan and obtained the first FAA grant to enable the main runway to accommodate heavy jets for commercial flights.
Jim was always keenly interested in the financial operations of our local governments.

He was born on May 5, 1935 in Tampa Florida to Dillard Dashwood Hicks, Sr. (“Dash”) and Jessie Mae Hicks. Tommy Sr. graduated from Gainesville High School in 1953 and attended the University of Florida. He served two years in the Marine Corps, stationed in Japan. He worked as a congressional aide, in property investments and in real estate.
Tommy Sr. was a Mason and a member of the Shrine Club, the Elk Club, the Jaycees, the Exchange Club and Gainesville Quarterback Club. He was one of the first members of the Gator Touchdown Club. In later years, he enjoyed his Wednesday lunches with a group known as the “Has Beens.”
Tommy Sr. loved the Gators and his place on Lake Swan. He was an enthusiastic member of the “Give’em Hell, Pell” fan club and looked forward to home games where he would join his buddy, Beazy Stephens, for the games. Between the two of them, the Gators would win every game if the coaches would only have consulted them. Some of his favorite football road trips were with Ike Gainey (Leader), Ronnie Neder (Tailgunner), Gene Craig (Wingman) and Tommy Sr. serving as the other Wingman. The stories he could tell would make one laugh, while also hoping that the stories may not be entirely true.
Tommy Sr. loved having friends and their families to his home on Lake Swan. He loved to cook, often grilling burgers and ribs. His favorite time of day at the lake was late afternoon. The kids would have to come ashore and the adults took over the boat, known as the Bizmarck and later a pontoon boat, for an “attitude adjustment” ride- a very slow cruise around the lake.
Tommy Sr. was preceded in death by his parents and his brother, Dillard Dashwood Hicks, Jr. He is survived by his three children: Thomas Perry Hicks, Jr., Alison Cox (David) and Stephanie Ference and by three grandchildren: Jordyn, Kyle and Brice.

Captain Wells spent one year at Severn Academy in Annapolis, MD, before becoming a proud member of the class of 1947 at the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA), Annapolis, MD. His desire to attend the Naval Academy first began when his Boy Scout Troop visited the Academy during the first National Boy Scout Jamboree in Washington, D.C. in 1937. He knew what his career would be when he stepped foot on the campus, continuing his love for the ocean that he developed in Marblehead, MA, the Sailing Capital of the World, and home of the U.S. Navy.
He had a lifelong passion for the U.S. Navy and proudly served on active duty for over 30 years, 18 of which were sea duty, including destroyers, submarines, aircraft carriers, and amphibious ships. He commanded two submarines, a large amphibious ship, and was a Commodore of an amphibious squadron of eight ships where he served as Commander Caribbean Amphibious Ready Group and Commander Amphibious Task Force, Sixth Fleet.

Following this, he served on the staff of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, stationed in London. During their 4 years in London, his family enjoyed being “Brits” by immersing themselves in British Culture. Mase and Les learned to drive on the left side of the road, they eventually bought a house and enjoyed socializing with their British friends and neighbors, with whom they have stayed lifelong friends. Holly and Peter attended English schools so were as English as their friends. While in London, the family took excursions to many foreign countries including Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Jerusalem, Jordon and Egypt. During his active duty in the U.S. Navy, Captain Wells was awarded the Secretary of the Navy’s Commendation Medal and two Presidential Legion of Merit Awards.
On retiring from the U.S. Navy, in 1976, with over thirty-three years of service, Mase joined Environmental Science and Engineering, Inc., an employee owned company in Gainesville, FL, where he served in various positions until he was promoted to General Manager and Executive Vice President. He was a member of ESE’s Board of Directors. During his twelve years of service with the company, he oversaw its growth from about 70 people to well over 1,400 engineers and scientists.
Mase was a leader in many professional, civic, and military organizations. He served on the Board of PSMA, a national organization of chief executive officers and business managers of professional service firms. In Gainesville, FL Mase served on many civic, youth, fund raising, and charitable committees and boards. He was a USNA Blue and Gold Officer, he served for five years on the Board of Trustees, he also served on the Board of Directors of the USNA Class of ’47, and was a life member of USNA Alumni Association.

She and Walter were married for 54 years before his death in 1993. On their anniversary, Walter gave her a red rose for every year of marriage. Every year, without fail, Alois would say “Walter, you shouldn’t have.” After graduating from high school, Alois borrowed fifty dollars to attend business school where she trained as a secretary and subsequently worked at the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company in Ft. Wayne, Indiana.Walter and Alois moved multiple times during their marriage: Ft. Wayne, IN, Kendallville, IN, St. Joseph, MI, Toledo, OH, Worthington, OH, Richmond, VA, and Atlanta, GA to name a few. During an interview that her grandson Rob conducted on her 100th birthday, Alois recounted living in the south during the Civil Rights Movement. A life-long Democrat, Alois recounted meeting Jimmy Carter and volunteering for Sen. John Glenn. In retirement, Alois was an active volunteer for over 25 years at North Florida Regional Hospital, a member of the Gainesville Garden Club and an election day poll worker.Retiring to Gainesville, Florida in 1983, Alois and Walter became active members of the First United Methodist Church of Gainesville. Life-long gardeners, Walter would give Alois a rose from his garden almost every day. Alois “puttered” about her gardens growing various flowers and vegetables. Alois would drive her family crazy while playing cards as she would debate which card to play which often resulted in the exasperated utterance of Walter stating, “It’s a fast game, Alois” to which she would respond “Oh, Walter.” Much to the dismay of her grandchildren, Alois would often win after Walter would allow portions of the game to be replayed upon Alois discovering a card she did not know she held. She was very lucky in both cards & love!After Walter’s death, Alois remained in Gainesville for many years. Alois became an avid Gators fan when she began dating Jim McCathren, a long-time coach in the basketball program at the University of Florida, when she was 80 and he was 86. To the chagrin of many of her grandchildren, this was during the era when UF football was quite competitive and Alois would make sure that her grandchildren knew the scores on winning Saturdays and she knew all the players and their positions!Jim died in 2012 at the age of 101. Alois moved to Plano, TX in 2012 to be closer to her family. She was able to spend time with her grandchildren Rob, Sarah, and David who live in the area. Shortly before her 100th birthday, she danced with her eldest great-grandchild, Donald McDowell at his wedding reception in Oklahoma after McDowell’s marriage to Jasmine Justus.She was truly a member of the greatest generation. Alois’ love of bargain hunting, her humor, her abiding Christian faith, her lifelong learning and spirit of volunteerism live on in her daughters, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Always the life of the party, she will be deeply missed by those who were fortunate enough to know and love her.Memorials may be made in her name to: First United Methodist Church of Gainesville, 419 NE 1st Street, Gainesville, FL 32601.William “Keith” HicksWilliam “Keith” Hicks, age 60 of Gainesville, FL passed away peacefully after a long illness on January 28, 2019 at E.

His early years were spent in Gainesville and he later attended Sewanee Military Academy, where he became the Mid-South Boxing Champion. After graduation from Leon High School in Tallahassee, he attended the University of Florida and later graduated from Florida State University. When asked about the transfer from one college to its rival college, Tom would proclaim, “I left under suspicious circumstances”. He had a very special gift for making people laugh. He was also an avid sportsman who had a passion for hunting and fishing. He was considered by many to be the best “shot“ they had ever seen with a shotgun.Tom’s next adventures took him to the Florida Keys, where he remained for many years taking part in fishing tournaments, spear fishing, writing poetry and further perfecting the art of storytelling. He was a regular at The Islamorada Fishing Club and Cheeca Lodge. Tom was the closest thing to Ernest Hemingway…well, since Ernest Hemingway.After some years in the bond business, having enjoyed the Keys and with a multitude of African safaris under his belt, Tom pursued his love for shooting and began competing in “Sporting Clays”. It became evident this was his true calling. He quickly found success as he engaged in this sport. He traveled the world with his longtime companion, Bettie Bedell, collecting medals along the way. Bettie caught Tom’s eye in high school and they rekindled later in life; a union that lasted over 30 years until his death.Tom was the first American to win a gold medal in the European FITASC Championships. The story goes, it was customary for the gold medalist to stand on the podium while his home country‘s National Anthem was played. Tom’s victory was such a surprise to the Europeans, the tournament officials could not find a copy of the US National Anthem. Tom also won the USSCA National Sporting Clays Championship, among countless other championships both local and abroad.Tom made many friends on his journeys and filled their lives with much laughter. He will be very missed.
He is survived by his son Harold Leon “Tripp“ Sebring, III, his daughter in law, Deanie Sebring and his granddaughter Katherine Marie “Katie” Sebring.A memorial service will be held in Tom’s honor at 11am on Saturday, February 2, 2019 at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, located at 100 NE 1st St., Gainesville, FL 32601.

Born October 21, 1920, in Brandon, Florida, Don was a native Floridian. He attended Brandon Elementary School and graduated from Plant High School in Tampa, Florida. Prior to enlisting in the Army in 1942, he was employed by the Florida Grower Press and the Seaboard Airline Railway. During World War II, Don was in both the 8th and 9th Air Forces of the Army Air Corps. Serving with the mobile 382nd Air Service Squadron as an airplane and engine electrician, he worked on P-47 fighter bomber aircraft, which included duties in England, France, Belgium, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. After landing on Omaha Beach as part of the D-Day offensive, his unit established the first temporary aircraft landing strip in Normandy at St. Pierre-du-Mont. Don later became a member of the D-Day Normandy Veterans of North Central Florida and attended the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy, a very meaningful experience for him. Recently, in May 2018, the French government presented Don with the Chevalier da la Légion d’honneur (the French Legion of Honor) for his service liberating France.

In addition to instructing his own UF courses and doing research, Don coordinated Soils Department teaching activities for many years, serving as its undergraduate counselor and graduate student coordinator.

His parents were sharecroppers on land owned by his grandfather, Earnest Johnson; Dwight was a champion cotton picker who could pick over 200 lbs a day. After graduating from Mt. Zion High School in 1949 he enrolled at Berry College, majoring in physics and mathematics and graduating summa cum laude in 1953. Adams and his wife, Joan Gordy Adams, were married in 1953. He obtained his master’s degree in 1954 from Emory University and was drafted into the Army, serving two years at Ft. Dietrich, Maryland. In 1960 he received his doctorate degree in low temperature physics from Duke University and then conducted post-doctoral research at Stanford University. While at Stanford he invented a switch that makes MRIs possible. In 1962, he became assistant professor at the University of Florida, associate professor in 1967, and professor in 1970. One of his earliest achievements was development, with his student Gerald Straty, of a highly sensitive gauge for measuring pressure at temperatures near absolute zero (minus 460 Fahrenheit). The Straty-Adams gauge has been adopted worldwide, and several of the original gauges are now in the Smithsonian Institution. Adams and colleagues also established the International Committee on Weights and Measures standard for defining temperatures within a fraction of a degree of absolute zero. In 1985 Adams and two colleagues obtained a $2M grant from the National Science Foundation and established the Microkelvin Research Laboratory, where he was its first director and principal investigator. The laboratory is the largest ultra-low temperature laboratory in the world and only one if its kind in the U.S. and achieves temperatures far colder than any in nature. Adams spent sabbaticals at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Nagoya University, University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, and Hahn-Meitner Institute Berlin. He wrote over 150 scientific papers and was co-editor of two books. He was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1972, received the Jesse W. Beams Research Award from APS in 1978, was recognized in 1986 as Outstanding Florida Scientist by the Florida Academy of Sciences, and received the Joseph F. Keithley Award in 2005 for Advances in Measurement Science from APS. In addition to his career in physics, Adams was devoted to environmental and public interest matters. He was a state and national leader in promoting recycling, waste reduction, and energy conservation and chaired the Sierra Club’s national committee on solid wastes. As the first legislative liaison of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, he significantly influenced the state legislature and successfully pushed for enacting Florida’s major recycling legislation. Adams also led efforts to establish the first curbside recycling, yard waste collection, and volume-based waste collection programs in the state. He also served on the Alachua County Energy Conservation Strategies Commission, providing expertise on reducing energy consumption and wastes. Adams’ other primary environmental interest was land use planning and development. He successfully fought intensive development along the Suwannee River, for which he received the Land Conservationist of the Year award from the Florida and National Wildlife Federations in 1990, and he pushed for stronger environmental protections throughout the state through his work on the Sierra Club’s Legislative Advisory Committee. Adams was extensively involved in the development of local comprehensive land use plans for over twenty years and served on numerous advisory committees to the Gainesville and Alachua County governments. He spearheaded successful efforts to encourage responsible development throughout Alachua County by, for example, preventing the construction of a beltway highway around Gainesville. Adams penned numerous guest editorials and was a frequent speaker in the media regarding public-interest issues. From the Sierra Club, Adams received numerous awards including the Florida Chapter Medal (2012), national Special Service Award (2013), and, with his wife Joan, the Florida Chapter Oak Leaf Award (1986). He was a founding member of the Alachua Conservation Trust and received their award in 2004 for contributions to land conservation in Alachua County and throughout the state. He is preceded in death by parents Lewis and Lois Adams, sister Dorothy Driver, and brothers Dumah Adams and Weems Adams. He is survived by his wife of sixty-four years, Joan Adams; sons Lowell Patrick Adams (Cathy Wilson), Darrell Adams (Kelly Moore), and Douglas Adams (Amando Navar); granddaughter Anna Adams; sister Clarice Cole; and brothers Dayton Adams (Mary Ann Adams) and Idus Adams. There will be a private service at Prairie Creek Conservation Cemetery.

Paul died September 7, 2018 of injuries sustained in an August 28 traffic accident. A 1952 graduate of Waldo High School, Paul was an eighth generation Floridian, Professor Emeritus in the Department of Tourism, Recreation and Sport Management in the College of Health and Human Performance, University of Florida. He is also the author to two novels pertaining to the history of Florida: Confederate Money based on Florida’s involvement in the Civil War and Black Creek based on the Florida Seminole Indian Wars. Both novels rely heavily on the Varnes’ family history as documented from military, governmental and other verifiable sources as well as family antidotes.  Paul (RA24650058) received a number of military commendations for his service in the US Army during the Korean War including the combat infantry badge, the bronze star with a “V” device for valor, and 2 purple hearts. His injuries were sustained during the last battle for Pork Chop Hill, July 9 and 10, 1953. After returning to the states, Paul spent the remainder of his military service at Fort Benning Georgia and Fort Lewis Washington. He was honorably discharged from service on September 8, 1956. Paul returned to Gainesville and along with numerous other veterans’ families lived in Flavet (Florida Veterans) Village while studying at the University of Florida. He earned bachelor (1960) and master (1961) degrees in Physical Education with a minor in math. His first teaching job was at Pensacola (Florida) High School (PHS) where he was also a highly successful track and field coach. After two years at PHS he returned to UF to pursue his doctorate of education (College of Education, 1967) while working as a graduate assistant in the Intramural Department (precursor to the current Division of Recreational Sports). Although he had a number of offers of employment in higher education upon completion of his doctorate, he had strong roots in Alachua County and wanted to remain close to home. Just before completing his doctorate, he received an Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title III federal grant to provide physical education/fitness programs to a five county area with demonstration schools based in Marion County. The Title III grant provided the foundation for highly successful, award winning physical education programs across the five counties. In 1968 Paul was recruited back to UF and the College of Physical Education, Health and Recreation (now the College of Health and Human Performance) as Chairman of the Department of Intramurals. With the reorganization of the College in 1976 the newly named Department of Recreation included the professional preparation curriculum as well as the Intramural program.  Paul was instrumental in the redevelopment of the Lake Wauberg Outdoor Recreational area overseeing the construction of new structures on the north end. Early in the 1980’s the Wauberg South Recreational area was opened. In addition to his impact on a number of recreational facilities on the UF campus, Paul was a driving force working with the UF’s Student Government leadership to secure funding for the O’Connell Center. Paul retired from the department and UF in 1996, after 28 years serving as department chair.  In addition to his involvement in the University community, he was a member of numerous county and city committees and councils, including the Tourism Development Committee (TDC). Paul was also a nationally and internationally recognized leader in his profession, receiving numerous honors and awards. Having grown up in rural Alachua County, Paul was an avid hunter and fisherman. One of his greatest joys since his retirement was passing those skills on to other family members especially his grandsons. The youngest of five, Paul was preceded in death by his brother, Harvey O. Varnes, and two sisters Lorene Breeden and Constance (Connie) Lucius. Another sister, Sybil Haveard resides in Gainesville, FL. Paul is survived by his wife of over 40 years, Jill (Tutton) Wilson Varnes, his five children Paula Varnes Fussell (Greg) and Patricia Varnes (Walt Spelman) of Gainesville, James Wilson (Casey), and Jennifer Wilson Carlstedt (Ed) of Tampa, and Julia Rae Varnes (Ed Arp) of Gainesville; one granddaughter (Ella) and 11 grandsons (Brendan, Nick B., Alex, Wilson, Nick C., Chance, Justice, Austin, Palmer, Grayson, and Bryan); as well as numerous nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, the Varnes’ Family requests that donors support the charity of their choice and/or the University of Florida’s College of Health & Human Performance (HHP).

Thank you to Haven Hospice.Sarah Lois GreggSarah Lois Gregg, our mother, violinist, teacher of music, and friend to many, died peacefully on August 11th, 2018 just shy of her 96th birthday. She was born on September 8th, 1922 in Fall River, Massachusetts to Charles Abner Macomber and Ethel May Peckham, and was the youngest of four children in this stalwart New England family whose lineage traces back to Colonial America. Pre-deceased by her husband, Professor James H. Gregg, and her siblings, she is survived by a son Austin Gregg, daughter Cynthia Gregg, sister-in-law Janice Gregg, and numerous nieces and nephews.
Many interesting things about her life are noted in memoirs she penned some years ago. Fall River, situated on the steep banks of the Taunton River, was a prosperous textile mill town during her formative years in the early twentieth century. Sarah attended public schools beginning with primary education at the Spencer Borden School, then progressing to James Madison Morton Junior High School, to which she walked “rain, shine, snow, or sleet.” On June 28th, 1940 she graduated from B.M.C. Durfee High School, where she excelled at German and was a member of the Camera Club.
During her youth she spent many an idyllic summer on the Atlantic coast at Westport Harbor, where generations of her family had farmed the land. This early part of her life was also punctuated by annual steamship excursions to New York City, where in 1935 Sarah, with her sister Virginia, had their photograph taken on the yet to be opened George Washington Bridge – one sister standing in New Jersey, the other in New York.
She attended the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, graduating in 1944 with a degree in German Studies but also achieving a minor in music, having studied with the renown violinist Ottokar Cadek. It was at college that Sarah met her husband to be, Jim Gregg. After graduating she travelled home to Fall River, but returned to Alabama early in 1945, marrying Jim on January 7th. They remained together for 52 years until his passing in 1997.
With her husband serving an infantryman in the European Theater of Operations, Sarah found employment at the War Department in Washington, D.C. as a Cryptanalytic Aide in the Army Security Agency. There she worked in the Japanese Attaché Section deciphering coded messages by programming IBM computers. In May of 1946 Jim returned from the war and matriculated at Princeton University. There Sarah worked as a librarian, dividing her time between the Physics Library at Fine Hall, and the Chemistry Library in the Frick Laboratory. In 1948 Jim took a post-doctoral position in Chicago, and Sarah found employment in the Research Department of the National Safety Council. Another post-doctoral engagement led to Vanderbilt University, and Sarah became the secretary of the Physics Department. Moving on from Nashville she arrived at Gainesville, Florida in September, 1951, where Jim had accepted a faculty position in the Department of Zoology.
She loved the out of doors, plants, flowers, nature, and the local artesian springs. Over the course of 59 years she landscaped her large yard with an intricate series of pathways interspersed with gardens filled with many different plant species, including locally rare wakerobin rescued from a development. She shared plants and lots of Satsuma oranges with many folks.
Of all her interests Sarah Gregg will likely be most remembered for her involvement with the violin. She learned to play at an early age after discovering her brother Bob’s violin in the attic of their Fall River home. Lessons began with one Mr. Shoob, and continued on with others into college. She was a first violinist at Morton Jr. High, and later played in the Princeton Symphony Orchestra. Sarah was a member of the University of Florida Symphony Orchestra for many years, and a frequent participant in the Brevard (N.C.) Music Camp where she served also as the music librarian. Chamber music created with good friends memorably resonated through her home. She tirelessly taught violin, viola, and cello to countless children in the Gainesville community. An adherent of the Suzuki method Sarah began by giving private lessons, then extended her skills to teach string class to students at Brentwood School, then Westwood, and Ft. Clarke Middle Schools. A woman of much compassion, she made it a point to bring her string classes to perform at local retirement homes.
Later in life she engaged in charity knitting, gathering weekly with a group of cherished friends at a local yarn shop. She created many mitts and hats that were donated to recipients at the VA Hospital and other organizations in need.
Sarah’s vivacious spirit, generosity, and strength of character will be greatly missed by all of us who knew and loved her.
In lieu of flowers please consider a gift in her name to the Howard T. Odum Florida Springs Institute. A private celebration of her life will be planned for the near future. The family can be contacted at violin222@yahoo.comClare Maria NobleClare Maria Noble passed away at the age of 58 on July 27. She was born on April 7, 1960 in Fort Myers and is preceded in death by her parents Philip and Audrey Noble and a younger sister Stephanie Noble. A long- time resident of Alachua, Clare graduated from University of Florida and was a member of Alpha Chi Omega.
She retired as a deputy from the Alachua County Sheriff’s department after 30 years of service. Early in her career she was also a member of the Dive Rescue Team and led the Honor Guard. Her public service also included employment with Alachua County Fire Rescue and Alachua Police Department.
Clare was an avid animal lover. She owned and cared for horses, goats, cats and dogs most of which were rescued and each one uniquely special to her. She had a heart of gold for those in need and contributed not only financially but volunteered endless numbers of hours to humanitarian and animal charities. She leaves behind many cousins, other family members, and dear friends.
Memorial services will be held at the Milam’s Funeral Home Chapel located at 22405 W. Newberry Road on August 25 at 1000 AM. In lieu of flowers, for those who wish to contribute, donations may be made to the Alachua County Humane Society or Our Mims Retirement Haven Paris, Kentucky. Kassia Simonne Cook-WalshKassia Cook-Walsh was born in Walnut Creek, California on June 19, 1968 to Kirsten Gayen and Thomas Cook. Over the course of her life, Kassia lived all over the world. As a young child, she moved with her family from California to Spring Valley, New York. In 1976, she moved with her family from New York to Nairobi, Kenya; in 1979, she and her family moved to Lisbon, Portugal. After brief periods in New Hampshire and Miami (where she lived with her Dad and his wife, Laura), and a return to Portugal, she lived with her Dad and Laura in Cedar Key, FL. There, she worked as a waitress at Cooks Café, a restaurant they owned. She then moved to Gainesville, departed it briefly to live with her mother in northern California, and then returned to Gainesville to settle permanently in 1991. On December 21, 2012, Kassia married Michael Walsh. Their wedding ceremony was small and intimate: a close group of friends and family all pulled on some cowboy boots and walked from their porch to the courthouse. Their home, like their marriage, overflowed with love. Together they raised and cared for four dogs (Sula, Norah, Jack, and Jo) and seven cats (Yume, Suejoe, Samson, Annie, Llamar, Biscuits, and Gravy). Mike’s entire family—children, mother, brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews—became Kassia’s family. It was like she’d been there all along. Kassia was a tremendously talented artist—a potter, painter, drawer, and craft maker. From a very young age, she consistently placed first in her art programs, even in her competitive and rigorous courses in Lisbon (where she studied art for a year). Throughout her life, she was constantly working with her hands. She had a natural inclination and capacity to make the world around her more beautiful. She could take any old thing—a lost button, a piece of glass, a few stray beads, an old cigar box—and find a use for its beauty. Friends and family will remember the detail and attention with which she decorated and personalized gifts, sometimes with humor, often with great nuance and care, and always with love. For many years, Kassia worked at The Top restaurant, a community that she loved, and one which she helped to build and sustain with her humor, grace, and grit. The most experienced server at The Top, she became known as Mama Kas. The love she had for her friends was immeasurable. They were her root system, and, in the truest sense of the word, family—a genuine reflection of who she was and wanted to be. Kassia passed away on the night of Tuesday, August 7th in the gentle, loving company of her husband Mike. Her humor, generosity, love, courage, and intense creativity—qualities that inspired everyone she knew—will continue to brighten and emanate from each of our hearts. The same is true of the great strength that she showed in the final months of her life. Just as she has returned to nourish the earth, her life will continue to nourish our own. She lives on in her dear husband Mike, father Thomas, mother Kirsten, brothers Nic and Sinclair, Nic’s wife Jill and their son Lars, stepchildren Keenan and Emily, loving stepmother Laura and dear Aunt Jeaniene, Uncle Henrik, five other brothers- and sisters-in-law (Tim, Sean, Mary, Patty, Marjorie), eleven other nieces and nephews (Tyler, Ryan, Lauren, David, Jessica, Andrew, Sydney, Megan, Maddie, Sasha, and Erin), the dogs and cats (her babies), her beloved friends and coworkers, and countless others.Mary Buck ParrishMary Buck Parrish passed away August 4, 2018 at the age of 101 in her home at Oak Hammock in

Amanda Parrish Reed of Gainesville, her great-nephews, J. Parrish and Darby Parrish of
Gainesville, her great-great-nieces Matilda McKune Parrish and Elizabeth Parrish Reed, and her greatgreat-

was preceded in death by her husband of 55 years, M.M. Parrish, Jr., her brother, Charles William Buck,
her daughter, Jean Jordan Haley, and her nephew, Jim Parrish. Mary was born November 23, 1916 in
Gainesville, FL to Catherine Macy Hampton Buck and Dr. William John Buck. After losing her mother to
the flu epidemic in 1918, and with her father away at war, Mary was raised by her grandparents, Minna
Jordan Hampton and William Wade Hampton in Gainesville, FL. She attended Kirby Smith and
Gainesville High School before enrolling at Duke University. She then transferred to the University of
Kentucky before studying interior design in New York and ultimately becoming an Arthur Murray dance
instructor at dance schools in New York City and Miami, FL. Mary Buck married M.M. Parrish, Jr. in
1946 and they built an amazing life together. Mary loved her husband fiercely and was immensely
proud of his work as a builder, developer and real estate broker in the Gainesville community. Mary and
M. travelled the world together with close friends. Gator Football games were a big part of their life and
Mary and M. often hosted pre-game parties at their home. Mary was an active, life-long member of
Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Gainesville where she taught second grade Sunday school for 25 years.
Mary loved gardening and was very involved in the Gainesville Garden Club for over 45 years. She was a
charter member of the Day Lily Circle and became a Master Flower Show Judge all over the state. She
was a golfer and avid bridge player. Not long after her husband’s death, Mary moved to Oak Hammock
where she was one of the first residents and where she made her home for the last 15 years. Hosting
friends and family, listening to books on tape, sharing her feisty opinions and playing bridge with her
friends remained key parts of her life at Oak Hammock. Mary loved the visits from her great-greatnieces
and nephews. It was they who insisted on throwing their “Nana” a 100th birthday party. Mary
was part of the fabric of the Gainesville, FL community and will be missed by her family and friends. A
memorial service will be held at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church on Tuesday, August 14th at 3pm with a

32635-7608.Robert Gordon GarriguesRobert Gordon Garrigues, 84, died July 18, 2018 at the E.T. York Haven Hospice Care Center in Gainesville, Florida after being lovingly cared for by the nurses, attendings, and other staff in the CV-ICU unit at the Shands Heart and Vascular Hospital. He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Margaret Williams Garrigues; his four children Robert M. Garrigues (Debbie) of Tampa, Sarah Garrigues-Jones (John L. Jones) of Gainesville, Amanda Garrigues DeMouey (Scott) of Gainesville, John T. Garrigues III (Amy) of Roseville, MN; his eight beloved grandchildren, Noah, Padgett and Tristan Jones (Gainesville), Emily and Samantha Garrigues (Tampa), George and Lula Garrigues (Roseville, MN), and Finn DeMouey (Gainesville); his brother John T. Garrigues, Jr. and sister-in-law, Louise Garrigues (St. Petersburg); nieces Laura and Cathy, and a number of other relatives and close friends.
Robert was born on June 24th, 1934 in Kansas City, MO. After graduating from East High School in Kansas City, MO, he attended Northwestern University in Evanston, IL for a year before joining the Army. From that time until his death, Robert was an avid supporter of our nation’s armed services and spoke often of how his time in the Army benefited him. After an honorable discharge, Robert enrolled and graduated with a Master’s of Divinity from the Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, GA. He furthered his education by earning a Ph.D. in Academic Administration at Florida State University. He went on to work for the Board of Regents in Tallahassee before moving, with his wife and four children, to Gainesville in 1972.Dr. Garrigues held top financial appointments in UF Health Science Center administration for 28 years, including the post of Associate Vice President for Finance and Operations, with responsibility for all of the center’s financial, operational and physical plant functions. Dr. G. was always interested in his employees’ lives, celebrating the joys and accomplishments and mourning the sorrows. Everyone who worked for him knew that work was a safe haven where they would be cared for and protected. His legacy as a university and college business officer and financial planner can be seen in the state-of-the-art buildings that surround the UF Health Science Center.
After a reorganization of the Office of the Vice President for Health Affairs in 1998, Dr. Garrigues transitioned to the role of Associate Dean of Administrative Affairs and Lecturer at the College of Health Professions, as the college was then known. His leadership contributions included serving as interim chair of the physical therapy department and as residency coordinator for the master’s in health administration program.For Dr. Garrigues, one of the most gratifying aspects of his career was teaching courses in the college’s undergraduate health science program, which he continued to do well after his retirement as Associate Dean in 2003. He received the college’s Teacher of the Year award in 2002 and the Teaching Excellence Award in 2015. During his tenure he taught US Healthcare Systems and a Leadership course he developed himself. He was also an avid user of social media, using it specifically to keep up with the personal and professional lives of his former students.
Robert also had a very fulfilling life outside of the University of Florida. He was a member of several local troops in the Boy Scouts of America, serving as Assistant Scoutmaster for many years, and camping and hiking with his two sons, Rob and John. Robert was also active at Trinity United Methodist Church in Gainesville, serving on the Finance Committee, singing in the Chancel Choir, founding and teaching the Covenant Adult Sunday School class, and serving as a Youth Counselor during all the years his children attended the Methodist Youth Fellowship. He also spent several years playing the role of Drosselmeyer in Dance Alive’s annual performance of The Nutcracker as a way to be involved in his daughters’ activities.
One of Robert’s greatest passions was the performing arts. He was a gifted singer, guitar player and actor, and he passed his love of music to his children and grandchildren. In 1976, his wife, Margaret, wanting him to get out from underfoot, told him to “find a hobby”. He did just that when he auditioned for the Gainesville Community Playhouse (then known as the Gainesville Little Theater) production of Oklahoma! and was cast as the surly Judd Fry. That moment was the beginning of his life-long involvement with theater in Gainesville as an actor, director, board member, and President for Life. Perhaps his greatest personal achievement, outside of his children and grandchildren, was his instrumental role in the construction of the Vam York Theater at the Gainesville Community Playhouse, where he spearheaded the effort to raise $750,000 for the project.
Most importantly, Robert loved his family. He spent his whole life as a man of integrity who could not be moved away from honesty; never falling when faced with temptation of any kind. He always held firm to the principles of his seminary teachings, and was a living example of loving your neighbor as yourself. He will be greatly missed.
There will be a Celebration of Life service for Dr. Garrigues on Saturday, August 25th at 11 AM with a reception to follow at Trinity United Methodist Church in Gainesville, FL.Roger HammRoger Hamm, 78, passed away July 23, 2018 at NFRMC after a long illness.

Emmel announce his passing on Saturday, May 26, 2018, while traveling abroad in Brazil.  He was 77 years old.
Tom is lovingly remembered by his brother, John Emmel (Phyllis), his nephew, Travis, and his niece, Alexis. In addition, a multitude of friends, colleagues and former students will forever honor Tom – a noted conservationist, naturalist, prolific author and visionary – for his kindness, humor, encyclopedic knowledge and wide-ranging interests. He epitomized the ideal of the professor as educator, mentor, supporter and inspiration.
Born on May 08, 1941, Tom grew up in Los Angeles, California. His parents, Edward and Ardyce Emmel, met on an outing sponsored by the Sierra Club and encouraged an interest in nature, including taking Tom and his brother on many camping trips to all the national parks in the western U.S.  Around age eight, at the suggestion of his father, Tom, then younger brother John, began collecting butterflies on all their family trips. This began a lifelong passion they shared. Their mother further encouraged their interest by driving them to entomological society meetings at Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. His parents, a den mother and scout master, respectively, were very much involved with the scouting program, and the brothers were Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Explorer Scouts, and became Eagle Scouts as well.
When Tom was a high school senior, he was one of 40 winners of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, for which he won a trip to Washington, D.C.  Upon graduating from high school, Tom went with ornithologist L. Irby Davis, for a three month trip to southern Mexico.  Tom assisted Mr. Davis in recording bird songs in the early morning and evening, then collected butterflies during the mid-day. He returned to southern California with several thousand specimens – and his lifetime interest in tropical entomology was secured. As it would turn out, some of those specimens were representative of a new species – which in April 2018 was named Cyllopsis tomemmeli in his honor.
Tom earned his B.A. at Reed College in 1963.  During the summer breaks from college, Tom was a nature counselor at Sanborn Western Camps for Kids, in Colorado.  He earned his Ph.D. in Population Biology at Stanford University in 1967, and was a Post-doctoral Fellow in Genetics at the University of Texas from 1967-1968.  His unbridled commitment to and support of the University of Florida began in 1968 when he joined its faculty as Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences & Zoology. In 1973, he became an Associate Professor of Zoology and three years later, in 1976, he became a Professor of Zoology. He served as department chairman for Zoology, directed the Department of Zoology Division of Lepidoptera Research from 1980-2003, and directed the UF Boender Endangered Species Laboratory since its inception in 1995.
In 2004, Tom was chosen to be the Founding Director of the Florida Museum’s McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at the University of Florida.  The McGuire Center was Tom’s vision and concept: A state-of-the-art research and teaching center that focused on Lepidoptera and the biodiversity they represent, and by extension a facility that engaged the public and created awareness of nature’s beauty and relevance to our lives.  The Center was brought to fruition by the generous support of Dr. and Mrs. William McGuire, lifelong friends and admirers of Tom and his efforts. Under Dr. Emmel’s leadership, The McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity has become world-renowned for research on biodiversity, habitat loss, and Lepidoptera; a major publisher of related scientific studies; a force in public education about our environment and its biodiversity; and the repository for the largest collection of Lepidoptera specimens in the world
Tom authored more than 400 scientific publications, including 35 books.  His many personal research interests included the endangered Schaus Swallowtail population in the Florida Keys; the effects of mosquito control pesticides on non-target wildlife and humans living in south Florida; microevolution, population biology, and ecological genetics of Cercyonis butterflies; chromosome evolution and macroevolution in the Lepidoptera; mimicry complexes in Mechanitis and Melinaea ithomiine butterflies in the Neotropics; biology, life histories, ecology, and conservation of the California butterfly fauna; fossil butterflies; and butterfly diversity in many areas of the world. He worked tirelessly to encourage efforts to promote conservation and natural habitat preservation, such as through the Miami Blue–Save Wild Florida license plate initiative and conservation biology efforts for the overwintering Monarch butterfly sites in southern Mexico. Throughout his lifetime, Tom mentored countless students – fostering and encouraging their careers in entomology, taxonomy, the study of tropical rainforests, and conservation biology.
Dr. Tom Emmel leaves behind a tremendous and unparalleled legacy. His vision, imagination, and energy in the service of conservation and Lepidoptera will continue to inspire and inform future generations of scientists, as well as the public in general.  His life work contributed to making a better world, and the impact will be enduring.
In lieu of flowers, memorial donations in memory of Tom can be made to the Thomas C. Emmel Founding Director’s Endowment, which supports collections and research at the Florida Museum’s McGuire Center.
Funeral services and a celebration of life for Tom are to be announced in the near future.Kevin Dale DavisKevin Dale (caveman) Davis, 33, of Newberry, FL. passed away on May 20, 2018 at North Florida Regional Medical Center.

He was our confidante, protector, DIY guru, and friend. He taught us to shoot, back a trailer, lay a hardwood floor, find a scallop, plaster a wall. Whenever friends or family needed a hand, he showed up in his magic bus, a van filled with tools and weapons and a dog or two, and would help finish the project, explaining patiently how and why. He devoured books, loved to hunt and fish and boat. He worked hard and laughed a lot. He was kind to animals and generous to those less fortunate. He was the strongest man who ever lived. He married his best friend, Donna, and for her we grieve. Disconcertingly, when he died, the world did not stop. As our hearts broke open, the mailman delivered mail, phones rang, planes flew overhead. Life went on. We who loved him go on, too, even though it really hurts. We cling to a series of lasts….the last time he said, “I love you,” the last meal shared, the last time we hugged him tight–all hard, wiry muscles and bristly beard, smelling like trees and leather and sawdust. Our brother, son, husband is gone. We will miss him every day for the rest of our lives. We are going on. We will carry him with us. Loved and missed by his wife, Donna, mother, Arbutus, son, Brandon, sisters, Peg (Paul) Coffman, Pat (Allen) Floro, and Pam (Bryn) Jones, brother, Bryan (Linda) Turner, numerous nieces and nephews, especially his hunting buddy, Zac.

Roy Edward “Eddie” Weems, Sr.Roy Edward Weems Sr., “Eddie”, 67, of Bronson, FL., passed away Wednesday, October 4, 2017 surrounded by his family. Eddie was born to the late Willie Roy and Alma Weems on December 1, 1949 in Lawrenceburg, TN. He was a simple man and always put others before himself. Eddie was known to be a hard worker and an honest, dependable man. Eddie married the love of his life and soulmate, Cathy Shipp, on June 30, 1984. The couple soon welcomed their sons, Eddie Jr. and Darren. Eddie worked many years in the logging woods and began his own logging company that he proudly named Weems & Son’s Logging. Many people note him as the most determined and hardest worker one has ever met. After years of success in the logging industry, he eventually “retired” and began operating his two dump trucks to be at home more often. When he wasn’t hauling rock and building roads, he enjoyed every minute on his farm. He spent countless hours making his property immaculate and was proud of his accomplishment. He enjoyed cutting and baling hay and watching his cows graze. On Sunday mornings, Eddie and Cathy enjoyed their cup of coffee while admiring the beauty they had created on the family farm. He softened up in his later years when his boys met their wives, and he began to enjoy more time with his family. It wasn’t until the birth of his grandson, Kace that he actually admitted he would rather stay home than work! Eddie was extremely excited to meet and spoil his newest grandson, Eddie III. He had plans of having both boys on his lap helping to steer his tractors. God had a different plan though, and he was unable to meet Eddie III, but we all felt he knew when he was born four floors down from his hospital room. The angel kiss birthmark on Eddie III’s forehead is proof his PaPa welcomed him to this world. Eddie is survived by his wife, Cathy and his children, Eddie Jr. (Shanell), Darren (Kellie) and Laurie. He is survived by his grandchildren, Cody, Kace, and Eddie III as well as his siblings Gail, Carol, Jane, and Faron. He is predeceased by his parents, Willie Roy and Alma and his brother, Glenn.

Bill influenced and touched so many people throughout his life with kindness and encouragement. He was an integral part of university life as well as the fabric of his beloved Gainesville community.  Everyone who met Bill, loved him.
Bill was born on August 20, 1930 in West Belmar, N.J. to William and Mildred Donigan. He grew up as an only child, and was the pride and joy of his parents and grandparents. Bill graduated from Manasquan High School while excelling in football, basketball and baseball.  In 1947, Bill’s American Legion baseball club won the New Jersey state championship and he got to meet Babe Ruth at the awards banquet.
Bill attended Notre Dame on a baseball scholarship, transferring to Duke University where he lettered in baseball and soccer. He played 3rd base alongside All American shortstop Dick Groat as the Blue Devils went to the College World Series in 1952 and 1953. Bill was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies, but a shoulder injury cut his career short.
It was at Duke University where Bill met his beloved wife, Marilyn Cissie Murray. Cissie was a freshman and the daughter of Duke’s new head football coach, Bill Murray and his wife Carolyn Murray. It was love at first sight on campus and he pursued and adored Cissie from that day forward.  As a senior, and finally passing his Spanish exam, a prerequisite to being able to marry Cissie, on March 22, 1954 they were married in the Duke Chapel. Bill’s first job interview resulted in being hired at Old Republic Insurance and they moved to Dunedin, FL.  Early in his career, he was so successful at Old Republic, a large promotion was offered and the request to move his family to Chicago. The thought of leaving sunny Florida was dreadful and helped Bill and Cissie define a different path and pursue their dream of starting Donigan’s clothing store. For a short time, they moved back to Durham and learn the retail clothing business at The College Shop near Duke. They researched and traveled throughout the southeast to find the best college town to open their store. The rest is history.  Donigan’s clothing store was opened in Gainesville, FL in August 1958!
Donigan’s was always the place to be. Bill was the man to know. He was fun, exciting and often asked to “chaperone” fraternity dances at the Sigma Chi and Phi Delt houses. Bill developed a loyal following and University of Florida students were introduced to the ways of college fashion. Bill and Cissie taught men to tie ties, match colors and women how to dress for all occasions! During the 30 years in business, students who shopped at Donigan’s came back time and time again and often became lifelong friends, returning year after year to visit them. Bill was a mentor and encouraged many young people to stay in school, pursue their dreams, have fun and learn how to dress. He made every customer feel special when they walked in the door. If you had something important to dress up for, you went to Donigan’s.
Bill and Cissie loved raising their four children, as well as the rest of the neighborhood children on 23rd Terrace. Often waking up to 20 kids watching cartoons downstairs, who gathered before starting Gator game car parking or heading out to Florida Field to sell Coke’s. Bill and Cissie’s commitment to their children was impressive, teaching participation and sportsmanship through example. Bill spent family time coaching Little League, traveling to tennis tournaments, summers at Long Pond and his personal favorite, stone-crabbing and fishing at Cedar Key.  Later in his life, he and Cissie spent time in Cashiers, North Carolina at their mountain house and Wildcat Cliffs C.C.
His wife, Marilyn “Cissie” Murray Donigan, predeceased Bill on Jan. 21st, 2011 and he is survived by his four children; Bill and his wife Heyward, Marilyn Samaha and her husband John, Jimbo and his wife Janet, Cissie Triglia and her husband Bob, eleven grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

He was 82. Cliff was born on December 26, 1934 in Weeks Island, La. and grew up in nearby Morgan City. He was a 39-year resident of Archer, FL.
Cliff attended the University of Louisiana at Lafayette where he earned Bachelors (1957) and Masters (1959) degrees in Psychology. He further distinguished himself by representing the Ragin’ Cajuns in weightlifting and wrestling, winning the NCAA Championships in his weight class, and at one time was ranked #5 in the world and first in the nation. Later in life, Cliff was an avid golfer with a single digit handicap, and for some time held the record score at West End Golf Course. After working a variety of jobs which ranged from counseling special needs students in Florida to painting water towers in Michigan, he moved to Gainesville, and in 1967 earned his Doctorate in Education from the University of Florida.
In the Summer of 1968 Dr. LeBlanc was hired by the first President of Santa Fe Community College, Dr. Joe Fordyce. Cliff was one of a small group of administrators that created the atmosphere and culture of the college. This culture of innovation and student-centered education has been a model followed by many colleges across the country.
First and foremost, Cliff loved his work at Santa Fe College. He served the college in many roles including; Vice President of Student Affairs, Director of Human Resources, Director of College Success, Dean of Students, and after retiring, returned to teach Psychology until 2011. College Success is a groundbreaking program designed to provide students with the skills to be achievers in the classroom. His wife Kathleen has been an instructor in the College Success program since 1992.
Cliff had many interests including gardening and fishing. His home-grown vegetables and any fish that made it into the boat would end up in one of his Cajun meals, which he loved to prepare for his family and friends. A strong supporter of environmental causes, Cliff loved outdoor activities. He enjoyed telling jokes and was a master story teller. He relished taking almost any topic and telling a joke about it. He greatly valued the companionship of his friends. He was an avid reader; part of his daily routine was to visit the Archer and Newberry Public Libraries. As a child, he was noted for having read every book in his elementary school library. Cliff also built his family’s home in Archer with his own hands, only accepting help for a few tasks that could not be done alone.
Cliffs true love of his family was evident in every aspect of his life. He survived by his wife 41 years, Kathy. They were married June 26, 1976 in the chapel at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Cliff is also survived by three children: daughters Andree (Dave) Moran and Kathleen (Nick) Johnson, his son Paul (Vicki Shea), and three grandchildren Jason, Katherine, and Joey all of whom will miss Papa deeply.

On October 23, 1920, Mother was born on a farm outside of East Berlin, PA.  Inspite of knowing much heartache growing up, Mother held onto the happy memories of her childhood. She knew Jesus Christ as her Lord and Savior all of her life and her child-like faith was a source of comfort and encouragement to her as well as all those she influenced. After losing both of her parents, it became necessary for Mother to support herself in her teens as a live-in nanny. In her early twenties she went to live with an aunt and uncle in Florida where she worked in both a millenary shop and hotel coffee shop  At this time she met her future husband, George Ellis.  They married December 3, 1944 while he was home on leave from serving in New Guinea with the Army.  Prior to their marriage, Mother worked as “Rosie the Riveter” in Baltimore. They had their first three children (Marjorie, George, Jr., and Sharon) while living in Ocala and then moved to Gainesville, FL where their youngest son (Tom) was born.  After renting in town for four years, they bought a home in the Idylwild neighborhood on SW 19th Street where Mother resided for fifty years. Mother was the center of our extended family. She was the “Energizer Bunny” who kept a meticulous home, loved flower gardening, and feeding and caring for her family and others. Her joy, love of life and the beauty of creation, along with her kindness, servant’s heart, gentle ways, dancing eyes and smile, will always be appreciated and remembered. During her fifty-four years in Gainesville, Mother was a member of the First Baptist Church where she was active in her Sunday School class and Missions group. She was a long time member of the Gainesville Garden Club Daisy Circle.  Mother was also an active member of the Gainesville Women’s Club. She supported many charitable organizations with the Florida Baptist Children’s Home being the most dear to her heart.July of 2007, Mother moved to Seaford, VA to reside with her daughter Sharon and her family (George; Emily, Christine and David Altmann).  Being the people-person Mother is known and loved for, she quickly made friends and adjusted to her new surroundings.  While the move wasn’t without difficulties, Mother was always determined that happiness is a state of mind and not dependent upon circumstances.  She counted her blessings daily!  She was blessed to be part of the Granny Girls with her dear friends Nancy Tando and Marilyn Davidson. Their friendship was priceless!In early November, 2015 (shortly after her 95th birthday) Mother began receiving care from Riverside Hospice.  Her nurses, Heather Trombley and Dannielle Wellbrock , along with her aide, Sherinna Hammon, were excellent care-givers and kind, loving friends.  Velvet Young joined our family in February 2016 for the purpose of coming along side of us to give Mother the best care we could possibly provide.  In time, we realized that more assistance was needed and Cindy Rowe pitched in to lighten our load.  We are eternally grateful for all of the love and care that has been given to Mother and our family.Mother was preceded in death by her loving husband of forty-five years, George L. Ellis, Sr. (1919-1989); her first born child, Marjorie Kinnan Ellis Etheridge (1946-1971); her parents, Jacob Peter Mummert  (6/29/1895 – 2/6/1935) and Velma Rhea Walker Mummert (4/22/1901-12/27/1924); and two brothers: Merle Jacob Mummert (1/28/22 – 4/10/1924), Francis Ulee (Frank) Mummert (10/30/23 – 2/26/2001); and one sister, Lavern Florence Mummert (12/27/1924 – died at birth). She also mourned the loss of a dear niece and nephew as well as a great-niece and great-nephew.Mother leaves behind her dearly loved sister (in-law), Janet Mummert; three living children: George L. Ellis, Jr., and his wife, Audrey Alterman Ellis; Tom Ellis, and his wife, Janis Williams Ellis; and me, Sharon R. Ellis Altmann and my husband, George D. Altmann.   Mother’s twelve grandchildren were the apple of her eye: Mary Katherine Etheridge Brabham and her husband, Charles Brabham; Betty Kinnan Etheridge Rolling and her husband Chuck Rolling; Stacy M. Ellis Thomas and her husband Rodney (Bow); Amber N. Ellis; Jamme P. Ellis Kendall and her husband James Dale Kendall; James (Bo) Latham Ellis; Emily R.

Nelson Jones, Jr. and his wife Beverly, of Starkville, nephews Stan and James Jones, and niece, Christie Jones Lawrence of Irving, Texas.
Richard grew up in Starkville in a gracious Southern home that taught the importance of manners and education. A tall, lanky, handsome young man, he was quiet and introspective and enjoyed roaming the 700 acres of his father’s ranch lands outside of town.
He received his Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from Mississippi State University in 1961 and the degrees of Master of Science and PhD in Environmental Engineering from the University of Florida in 1964 and 1967, respectively. He was a member of Sigma Xi Scientific Research Society and Tau Beta Pi National Honorary Engineering Fraternity. At the University of Florida, his supervising professor and mentor was Dr. A.P. Black, with whom he worked closely on a number of consulting and research projects.
Upon graduation, Richard joined the Gainesville firm of Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE), now AMEC Foster Wheeler. In 1974, Richard and Larry Olson left ESE to form Jones, Olson and Associates. In 1975, Robert Edmunds joined the firm, which became Jones, Edmunds and Associates, Inc. Today, with 160 employees, the firm is ranked in the Top Twenty Design Firms in Florida and in the Top Two Hundred Environmental Firms of all types nationwide.
Richard’s expertise included domestic and industrial water and wastewater treatment, process engineering and design, in-plant waste reduction and hazardous waste management. He authored over forty environmental publications.

As a consultant to leading citrus processing firms, he developed the treatment processes used in the citrus industry.

Today, with subsequent partners John Fleming and Phillip Wagner, Trimark Properties owns and operates over fifty multi-family and commercial properties and is assisting in developing Gainesville’s Innovation Square area. The company has grown to over 50 employees and has received numerous City Beautification Awards.
Richard was a private, but adventuresome, man and enjoyed his solitary time fishing and hunting. He took scuba diving lessons and, for his first open water dive, descended over 100 feet into an underground cave. During the late 1970s and early 1980s he travelled to Switzerland every September to hike the glaciers with family and friends. He enjoyed travelling, especially to the Virgin Islands, for sailing and snorkeling.
In 1990 Richard moved to the peaceful beauty of Melrose Bay and loved to fish on Lake Santa Fe. In recent years, he and his wife, Terese, enjoyed travelling to Honduras to inspect her property and a school the couple helped establish for young women. Also, they traveled together for pleasure in the United States and Europe.
His quiet strength, his integrity, his intellect, and his wry sense of humor will be greatly missed by his family members, friends and associates.

https://give.audubon.org/Giving/Page/56/1/56Evelyn Christine DormanEvelyn Christine Dorman, age 61, died on February 25, 2017 at her home in Gainesville, Florida. A fourth-generation Gainesville native, she spent most of her life in her home town taking care of people. She was a registered nurse, and well-suited for this profession due to her sincere empathy for others. Evelyn lovingly provided around-the-clock care at the end of her mother’s life, and took care of her father and his second wife for over ten years. She was creatively gifted, and her artistic flair was evident in her paintings, drawings, and in the beautiful clothing that she designed and sewed by hand while a student at Valdosta State College. Evelyn was highly passionate, intelligent, opinionated, and independent. She was honest, even when it was inconvenient to be so, and fiercely loyal. Evelyn enjoyed walking on the beach and was an avid reader. She also had an adventurous streak that may not have been evident to those who did not know her well: Evelyn was a certified scuba diver, an experienced kayaker, learned how to fly an airplane, and even went sky-diving. Twice! She loved animals, particularly dogs, and thought that “fur babies” were more loving and kind than many people. Evelyn’s quick wit and dry sense of humor will be especially missed by those who loved her.
Evelyn is predeceased by: her parents, Henry Lafayette Dorman and Martha Cobb Dorman, both of Gainesville, FL, and her brother Henry Steven Dorman (Gina) of Fruitville Heights, UT. She is survived by her sister, Connie Clemente (John) of Houston, TX; her brother Rob Dorman (Joyce) of Augusta, GA; her sister Mary Jewell Dorman of Tampa, FL; her sister Sandra Brey (Paul) of Chapel Hill, NC; and many cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends.

In 2007 Darren moved from California back to Florida after the birth of his daughter to be closer to family. He soon began work in the fireworks industry and eventually branched off to open a Black Cat Fireworks outlet store.
Darren had a deep and lifelong love of the water, barefoot waterskiing, scuba diving, and especially surfing the biggest waves possible on the smallest surfboard imaginable. He was a spectacular and creative cook, who could create remarkable feasts with whatever he could get his hands on. Darren earned his race car driving licenses from the Sports Car Racing Association and the International Motor Sports Association, competing in races in Daytona Beach, Florida and Savannah, Georgia. He had a contagious laugh, a crazy good sense of humor, and an astounding energy about him. He was truly one of a kind. His path was not without challenges, but he was deeply kindhearted, funny, adventurous, smart, creative, and spirited. Above all, he adored his beautiful children, Cash and Fin, endlessly and he worked tirelessly to be the best father he knew how to be.
By sharing his personal experiences and challenges with addiction and recovery, he was able to help many others on their journey with recovery. That is an invaluable gift that will live on in the people and families he profoundly impacted along the way. He was a regular volunteer for Flagler County schools, spending hours in the classrooms of both his daughter and his son. He was a member of the Bunnell Elementary Watch D.O.G.S./Dads of Great Students, a father centered educational initiative of the National Center for Fathering.

Buddy was born in Rome, Georgia on Aug 17, 1928 and was the youngest son of four children. His parents were the late Duke Roberson Parker and Fleeta Belle Davidson. After graduation from Dunedin High School in 1945 he enlisted in the United States Navy. His permanent duty station was Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Buddy’s enlistment was heavily influenced by the loss of his only brother Jack Roberson Parker. Jack’s plane, The Queen Bee, was downed by Japanese fire in 1944. Jack survived the crash only to be captured and subsequently executed on June 19, 1945. Jack’s execution took place at the infamous Taihoku Prison Camp located on the Island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa. Buddy served in the Navy until December 22, 1947 just after the war’s end. Upon returning to Dunedin, Florida Buddy would soon meet the love of his life Beverly Ann Tool. This meeting was a consequence of a blind date at which, interestingly enough, the three men and three women paired according to their heights. You just can’t make this stuff up. After their wedding, held at The Parker home in Dunedin, the newlyweds moved to Gainesville, Florida in 1951 where the University of Florida was located and where they both attended school. After a year at the University of Florida Buddy became employed with the United States Post Office in Gainesville where he worked until he retired after 39 years of service. Buddy was an avid Gator fan and supporter of the University of Florida. He was fortunate to witness The Gator football team’s first SEC championship and first National Title. Buddy loved to hunt and fish. He trained his own bird dogs and would often be seen stopping at Tigert Hall where his wife Beverly was employed in order to “show off” the many ‘largemouth’ bass he caught. After retirement, Buddy spent his years researching his family genealogy. In addition, he also meticulously researched circumstances associated with his brother’s execution. On the 60th anniversary of that tragic event, Buddy was joined by his sons in Taipei, Taiwan at “The Killing Wall”, the location within the prison where it is believed that Jack was put to death. Subsequently a portion of Buddy’s research was published in the poignant book by author Fred B. Grant entitled “World War II: As told by the Few Who Were There, 2005.” Buddy enjoyed Gator Football, golfing, jogging and his sons. Nothing was more important to him than his family and he worked tirelessly, accruing much overtime so that his family never went without and all were provided with the opportunity of college educations. Buddy is survived by his four sons John Roberson Parker and his wife Trish of Melbourne, FL, Steven Hamilton Parker of Redwood City, CA, Jeffrey Duke Parker of Jacksonville Beach, FL and Charles Michael Parker of Boca Raton, FL.

Gordon Madison Prine, the renowned professor emeritus at the University of Florida, died Oct. 17 after a long illness. He was 88.
Dr. Prine, who joined The University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) in 1958, had a 45-year tenure as part of research faculty. He remained involved even after his retirement in 2003, until recent health declines prevented him from coming in to the office. He was always available to his colleagues and graduate students who sought his advice and counsel, one of his favorite parts of his job responsibilities.
During his career at the UF Agronomy Department, Dr. Prine conducted research and developed new types of an array of crops, including soybean, corn, alfalfa, pigeon peas, various cover crops, red and crimson clover, elephant grass, annual ryegrass. Most notably, he championed the rhizome perennial peanut, a forage crop. Thanks to his diligence, Dr. Prine was responsible for the development of this plant from a small plant introduction plot to now more than 40,000 acres used for hay and grazing throughout Florida.
Evidence of his legacy in perennial peanut popularity can be seen along the lawns of the UF Campus and Florida highways where patches of bright yellow flowers-rhizoma perennial peanut—are being used as a ground cover derived from old original plots of Dr. Prine’s, or planted by UF Grounds Department and Florida Department of Transportation.
Born in Valdosta, Georgia, Dr. Prine was the only son of Surry and Mattie Lou Cothron Prine. He grew up in rural Lowndes County, Ga., on his family’s farm where his father raised cattle and grew tobacco and corn. His childhood years were spent struggling through the Great Depression. Despite the hardships, Dr. Prine learned a valuable lesson: the importance of hard work and education. Indeed, education was what Dr. Prine called the most important element of a human life.
He became the first member of his family to complete numerous college degrees. He earned his bachelor of science and master’s degree in agricultural science from the University of Georgia. His Ph.D was awarded by the Ohio State University in 1957. His education was interrupted between 1946 to 1949 when he was in the U.S. Army Air Corp., serving during the Berlin Air Lift. While studying at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC) in Tifton, Ga., as part of his undergraduate degrees, Dr. Prine met and later married Mary A. Wells. Dr. Prine is survived by wife Mary; his son, Jeffrey Gordon, of New York City; his daughter, Leslie Prine Rosenfeld (Ronald Rosenfeld) of Jacksonville, FL; and his granddaughter, Hailey Madison Rosenfeld, a student at the University of South Florida. Other relatives include sister-in-law, Eloise Wells of Greenville, NC; his aunt, Maxine Cothron of Valdosta, Ga.; his cousin JoAn Cothran Mathis of Valdosta, Ga; and numerous cousins and nieces and nephews. His memorial service is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 4, at 1:00 p.m. at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, 100 NE 1st St., in Gainesville. In lieu of flowers, Dr. Prine’s family requests memorial donations in his name to the American Diabetes Association, and University of Florida Foundation (checks payable to University of Florida Foundation: Memo: Prine Memorial, PO Box 110500, Gainesville, FL) 32611.

In 1920 at the tender age of 4, Bill first arrived in Alachua County with his family which began his fateful connection with Newberry and the surrounding area. For 13 years he helped his father farm and run a dairy in the county while attending school in Alachua. No school buses back then, he walked or rode a horse the several miles to school. On the weekends he would milk cows for the Shaw family who lived nearby. He knew he wanted to go to college from an early age, when he would discuss it with his father he would just laugh and say,” Son you are going to make a fine farmer someday.” In September 1934 Bill succeeded in gaining entrance to the University of Florida. He did this with only $75 in his pocket of which $60 was needed to register for school. To pay for college he drove a school bus which paid very little but did come with room and board and all the squirrel stew you could eat. The only problem was the squirrels were served “heads and all”! His determination to obtain a higher education in the depths of the Depression with no financial support was almost unheard of during that time. In 1938 he graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in agriculture, a ROTC commission and as the 168th member of Alpha Gamma Roe fraternity. The graduating class was only approximately 400 students! Wasting no time, Bill started his career in agriculture as the first Agriculture teacher at Newberry High School reporting to Bill Barry, the local school trustee, on July 1, 1938. This would turn out to be the most fateful decision of his life as he met the love of his life, my mother, Cilla Karlene Thames. He met her the first week in town staying at the old boarding house across the street from the First Baptist Church of Newberry. They were married in this very church on June 1, 1939 over 77 years ago. During Bill’s tenure at Newberry High he started the first vocational agriculture program, established a chapter of the Future Farmers of America, renovated the top floor of the Little Red School House, and was awarded Highest Rated New Teacher in the State of Florida. Just as life seemed to be going their way, he received orders in August 1941 to report to the Army in Ft. Bragg North Carolina. As so many had during those years, he had been called to leave his wife and his career to join the war effort.
Assigned to the Army 72nd Field Artillery Regiment he reported as a green 2nd Lieutenant and began his stateside training. While in training Pearl Harbor was attacked resulting in his regiment being sent overseas where he saw action in the Solomon Islands of New Caledonia and Guadalcanal. On Guadalcanal he received the Bronze Star Medal for leading a crew of men during an air raid to repair damaged communication lines. In November 1944, surviving the war, he returned back to the states and made the first phone call to his wife in 3 years. Soon after his return he was released from active duty but he remained in the Army Reserve until 1958 by which time he had obtained the rank of Major. After the war Bill was eager to get on with his life and took a position as a personnel trainer with a large hardware company in Birmingham Alabama. During his time there he established a special program to attract and train war veterans. After that position he would try his hand at cattle ranching which finally lead to a sales position with a regional fertilizer company. His experience with farming and soft spoken manner made him a natural for sales to farmers in central Florida. It wasn’t long before he was promoted to Sales Manager and finally to the President of Wilson and Toomer Fertilizer Company in Jacksonville. When the company was sold he went to work for W.R. Grace and managed the fertilizer production facilities in Puerto Rico and Ft. Pierce Florida. In 1982 Bill and his wife retired and moved back to where it all began in Newberry Florida. Since his retirement he was active for many years in the First Baptist Church of Newberry, the Newberry Lions Club and various other community programs.
Bill and Collie Stone had two sons, three grandchildren and three great grandchildren. His son, Jim Stone passed away in April 1980. Sadly, in March 2013 Bill lost his wife and dreamed of the day when he will join her. Bill is survived by his sister Blanche Echols, his sister in law Nancy Stone, son Jack Stone, daughter in laws Cathy Stone and Shirley Stone, his grandchildren Adam Stone and his wife Dana Stone, Michael Stone and his wife Lauren Stone and Patricia Harder and her husband Nathan Harder, and his great grandchildren Will Stone, Ava Stone and Haiden Harder and numerous nieces, nephews and cousins. To all the friends and extended family in the Newberry Florida area we extend our deepest thanks for the friendship and love given to Bill and Collie over the years.

He worked to make a living on the farm in Georgia raising tobacco, cotton and corn. During the early years he and Ethel had three sons and two daughters. We were taught with love, discipline, to work hard and be honest. He exhibited these characteristics, therefore, he was a great example for us kids. He left the hard farm life and moved the family south to begin work with the City of Tampa as a mechanic, self- trained from working on farm equipment all those years in Georgia. Daddy retired from the city after 27 years but could not sit home idle. He built a big garage and started working on lawn equipment, cars and anything mechanical that did not work the way it was intended to operate. Mamma died in 1994 leaving Daddy in a big, empty house. Two years later he was ready to leave there-too much progress invading his property. Anxious to “get out of this mess,” he moved to Newberry to live with his daughter. Even in his 90’s he was always doing something, anything to keep busy. But the body began to react to all the years of hard work. July 11, 2016 Daddy, Pa, Uncle Howard, went to his last and greatest family reunion. He will forever be loved and remembered and deeply missed by his family and all who knew him. He was preceded in death by his wife Ethel Hart, son Vernon L Hart, and daughter Betty Joyce Hart.

He met the love of his life, Sandi King, on the white sand of Crescent Beach in August of 1964 and 3 months later, they were married in Roanoke, VA on November 28, 1964. They moved to Gainesville directly after their wedding where Ray continued his education. They were joined on their life adventure by their only child Antonio “Tony” in January 1967. After Ray graduated from college, he began his career of designing beautiful homes in and around the Gainesville area. His designs were and are known for their beauty as well as functionality. As always in keeping his love close, he brought Sandi into his office expanding his business opening Sandi’s Blueprints. In the 52 years of their marriage, he and Sandi created a wonderful, loving community of friends and associates. In 1976 Ray and Sandi along with a few friends introduced the Gainesville community to soccer. Ray was an excellent athletic himself and knew the importance and opportunities organized sports could give children – not to mention the FUN!!

But as they have always done, they faced it with a steadfastness and a confidence that was held together with their bond of love. Somewhere along the way, Ray lost his ability to design his beautiful homes but he never lost his love of soccer or the children. His favorite place was always on the soccer fields with his love Sandi who was always at his side. Even as recently as June of this year, Ray’s eyes would light up at Jonesville as the soccer fields were filled with kids of all ages. He would lift his arm, wave and smile to each and every one as they walked passed him. They were all special! He loved being a soccer coach, husband, father, friend and mentor, and he also loved history, big band music and dancing! He had a wonderful sense of humor and the absolute best laugh! His survivors include his loving wife, Sandi, his son ‘Tony’ and his wife Teresa, a grandson Juan Rivera and a great grandson Nathaniel. He also leaves behind a brother Demetrio Rivera and several nieces and nephews along with his wonderful cats. Ray was presented the E. T. York Service Above Self Award, by the Rotary Club in 1999.

He was a fearless little soldier who loved fireworks, music, and most of all food. He was passionate about his toys and his family. He would hug the microwave which we all called his girl-friend. Born October 11, 2014, he was a blessing, a beautiful sweet baby boy. We named him Vegas Malakai Hathaway. He came into this world with beautiful blue eyes and the heart of a lion. His beautiful golden locks were truly something to envy. With charm and enthusiasm he taught us life lessons. He taught us second by second the truth in the statement, “Life is not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away.” With a new understanding of what life can be his imprint in our hearts is divine. He struggled with some health issues and through it all he never let it affect his ability to smile, or damper his spirit. In Vegas’ presence you couldn’t help but exude joy and love. It was never hard for him to gain the admiration of those he interacted with. Like a firework he came bursting into our life with an explosion of love lessons. As his mother I am proud to say he exited this world with the same explosion of life love lessons. He leaves behind his loving parents, Ana Manning & Huron Hathaway, and his proud “BIG” brother Julian Manning. There are five family generations and numerous friends mourning the loss of this sweet perfect baby boy. All of these generations have their own definitive moments to cherish and be thankful for. We are heavy hearted knowing that our angel is no longer in the flesh. However we must have faith that his soul and spirit are enjoying his new paradise until we are reunited.

On June 8, 2016, at the age of 52, she peacefully passed of pneumonia, surrounded by family at Haven Hospice. Annette is survived by her mother Patricia Norberg, sisters Susan Poston (Bob) of Hawthorne, FL and Sally Matthew of Jacksonville Beach, FL and brothers Bob Norberg (Susan) Gainesville, FL and Jeff Norberg (Kathy) New Jersey and 8 nieces and nephews and 8 great nieces and nephews. Annette loved to attend the ARC workshop daily, go to garage sales with her daddy on Saturdays, buy groceries with her mom, watch the “Sound of Music” and “Mary Poppins” multiple times on the weekends and she loved to dance. She was a beautiful and sweet girl. She had more friends then any of the rest of the family. She was loved by family, friends and everyone she ever came in contact. Annette was born with Down Syndrome (at that time, it was referred to as “Mongolism”). Annette had her first heart catherization at 3 years old. It was decided she needed open heart surgery. In those days open heart surgery was not being performed on children with Down Syndrome in Minneapolis. Since children with Down Syndrome have lots of respiratory problems the family moved to Florida when she was 3 1/2 years old, for the warmer climate. She has lived in Miami, Tampa and moved to Gainesville in 2013. When she was 8 yrs old she needed heart surgery to live. Her mother took her to numerous cardiac surgeons in Miami. They all said they did not do surgery on children with Down Syndrome. Her former pediatrician from Minneapolis referred her family to Thomas Gentsch M. D., Cardiac Surgeon. Her mother took this tiny, 30 lb. blonde girl to his office. Upon first seeing her, he said “she is worth saving.” Dr. Gentsch and his team of doctors performed this risky surgery, The surgery was done at Variety Children’s Hospital in Coral Gables, FL. on March 2, 1972 when she was 8 years old. They corrected 5 defects, Tetrology of Fallot and an additional defect. After the 7 hour surgery upon removing the heart-lung machine her little blue body turned all pink. Dr. Gentsch was a “Miracle Doctor” and Annette was a “Miracle Child”. We understand Dr. Gentsch is no longer living. But we would like his family to know how appreciative our family is of this “Gentle Man”. He gave Annette a healthy and long life. You can learn more about Dr. Gentsch at http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/obituaries/article2482140.html. The Norberg family would also like to thank the Miami News for publishing an article on Annette’s surgery, complete with picture of her and her father while in the hospital. Over these 52 years we have seen many changes in the medical care for children born with Down Syndrome and we are grateful. We feel so blessed to have had Annette as part of our family. Annette will be missed terribly by her mother, sisters and brothers. She was “the light of our lives”. Annette was a gift to our family that kept on giving. In lieu of flowers family requests donations made to the ARC of Alachua County, 3303 NW 83 St. 32606. The ARC provides programs and services for persons with developmental disabilities. Annette attended their programs. Internment will be at the Florida National Cemetery alongside her father at a later date.

Mott, Jr, age 78, passed away at his home in Jacksonville, Florida, on Tuesday, August 16, 2016. L. A. was born January 10, 1938, in Brooker, Florida, to L. A. “Shine” Mott, Sr, and Cordella Brown Mott. He moved to Gainesville in his teens where he graduated from Gainesville High and attended the 14th Street Church of Christ. He studied at Florida Christian College from 1956 – 1959 where he was voted Mr. Florida Christian College. In 1959, he married Jill Whitehead. He completed his studies at Eastern Michigan University, with a degree in Language and Literature and Ancient History. He spent 50 years as a preacher in churches of Christ, including churches in Las Vegas; Michigan; Birmingham, Alabama; Ocala, Florida; and Maine. He is most known for his ability to study, understand, and communicate the Bible on a deep level. He has published widely-used tracts and booklets, such as “What is the Church of Christ?” and “Keeping Saved: God’s Good Gifts to Preserve His People”; study guides on the Bible, designed to enable church members of all ages to study the entire Bible in three years; and several books including Faith in the Book of Romans and Notebook on Jeremiah. Since 1996, he has published eleven books in the Thinking Through the Bible Series and CDs of his classes (thinkingthrough.org). He died with two more completed manuscripts on the New Testament books of Galatians and First Peter. One of his students expressed a sentiment shared by many: “Praise God for the life and work of L.A. Mott. His challenge toward rigorous study has both made my brain tired and my faith soar! I loved him, I cherish his writings, and I intend to use what he has left behind to continue to grow personally, and to teach others as we all follow him into the arms of our Savior.” He loved sports, especially the Detroit Tigers and the Florida Gators, fishing, bowling, movies, especially westerns, and was a voracious reader since childhood — from Tom Sawyer to Dickens to Zane Gray westerns to lengthy volumes of early American history in his last years. He loved simple southern cooking and fried seafood. He coached little league, played softball and racquetball, and ran 5ks. One of his most calming activities was to walk outside among the trees and talk to his Father in prayer. He truly dedicated his fine mind and determined spirit to serving the God he loved and helping Christians understand Scripture more accurately and apply it. L. A. was preceded in death by his parents and his wife Janie Alice “Jill” Whitehead Mott. Survivors include two sisters: Sandra Jergins of Tampa, Florida, and Jacqueline Brown of Alachua, Florida; three children: Deborah Cale of Jackson, Michigan, Richard (Lisa Abbott) Mott, and Todd (Rebecca Haynes) Mott, both of Jacksonville, Florida; and five grandchildren: Sam (Sarah Moyer) Cale (26), Laurie Cale (24), Thomas Cale (20), Ben Mott (19) and Emma Grace Mott (16). A memorial service will be held at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, August 27, 2016, at the Julington Creek Church of Christ, 1630 State Road 13 North, St. Johns, Florida.

A. recently completed (tinyurl.com/donate-mott).Dr. Ouida Fay PaulDr. Ouida Fay Paul, age 105 passed away May 24, 2016 at the North Florida Retirement Village in Gainesville, where she had been a resident since 1995.

She plainly stated she wanted a brief obituary. Her children risk an eternal lecture from her by offering herein a few more words than she might have preferred. Mama Peg, as she was known in her family, was an inspiration to her children and a foundation of her family. Soon after marrying Robert J. Williams, Jr., in 1951, she left her teaching career to begin the challenging work of raising and managing a family. As her children and grandchildren married, she accepted those spouses into the family with love and considered them her own. Those who predeceased her include Robert, her husband of almost 54 years, her son (in-law), Jack Funderburk, and her life-long best friend and sister-in-life, Mary Elizabeth Tillman. Those left to be saddened by her death but laughing with their memories include her children, Kathryn Ann Williams Funderburk of Navarre, Florida; Robert Lee & Cheryll Lynn Williams of Gainesville; and John Michael Williams of Gainesville; her grandchildren, Diane & Marc Gagnon of Gainesville; Jason Anthony Funderburk of San Antonio, Texas; Robert Scottley & Hannah Williams of St Augustine; and Kendra & Bill Booth of Navarre, Florida; and her great-grandsons – David Gagnon, John Booth, Nathan Booth and Michael Gagnon. Like most mothers, Mama Peg had many ‘momisms’ she would repeat time and again for us to incorporate into our lives. We are left with many of those but offer now the one where she said “You’ll miss me when I’m gone.” And with that, she proved herself correct once again. The family and Mama Peg requested no service so none will be held. If you wish to make a memorial contribution, the family requests you consider a donation in her memory to Haven Hospice, 4200 NW 90th Boulevard, Gainesville, FL 32606.Gussie Fowler RaumGussie Fowler Raum, age 87 of Gainesville, FL passed away on Tuesday February 16, 2016.

She is survived by her husband, Joseph A. Boccardy, Sr., three sons; Joseph, Vincent, and Michael Boccardy.

She was preceded in death by three sisters; Mary Koroblis, Carmela Nacca, and Anna Bryson. She was an active member of Holy Faith Catholic Church. She was a beloved wife, home maker, mother, grandmother, aunt, friend, and neighbor. Her home was the hub of activity in the neighborhood, as the joke was always that “she needed to install a revolving door in her house, because there was always someone coming and someone going”. Her kitchen was the heart of that hub, as she was always cooking, and no one ever went away hungry. Friends and neighbors would regularly come over to have a cup of coffee, and no one friend will miss her more than either of her best friends, Mary Cade, Doris Perry, or Orva Kauffman. Her extended family gathered often at her home on holidays so that all of them could gather and celebrate the joys of such a large, Italian household, eat her antipasta, her famous manicotti, and savor the smells of her home baked bread. Just two years ago, she managed to successfully pull off a Thanksgiving meal, at 82 years old, feeding 54 people from multiple states. She adored her family, and would show it through her food. For years, she was an active member of the regional Studebaker Club, and made several trips across the country to national Studebaker conventions, assisting with the logistics of the trips, and being a companion to her friends along the way. Photo album after photo album are filled with pictures of friends, antique cars, and memories from almost every state in the nation. She attended church every Sunday, and every day of observance. She was well known in Holy Faith Church, and her faith in God was unbreakable until her last breath. She is with her Lord in heaven now. Our loss is Heaven’s gain. We will all miss you, “Mimi”, “Toni”, “Mom”…. Funeral services will be held Saturday, January 16th at 9 a.m. at Holy Faith Catholic Church. The family will receive friends from 4-7 pm at the Milam Family Funeral Home, 311 South Main Street, Gainesville Florida.

Geraldine was born to Henry Reed and Clara Clark Falkner in the Clark ancestral home at Ellisville, Columbia County, Florida. Her long held belief was that age was irrelevant and therefore she preferred to leave age out of all things. Geraldine was fortunate to have been raised on the family farm and during her early years of life had the privilege of having her grandfather and grandmother, Oscar and Ida Bailey Clark live with her family. As a child, Geraldine enjoyed listening to her grandmother read classic literature aloud and acquired early entrepreneurial skills watching her manage a small business. She had many fond memories of being raised in a loving and close family and benefited from the relationships of her large extended family. Upon graduating from high school, Geraldine attended Florid State College for Women where she was a music major. After deciding music wasn’t her forte, and knowing she was no farm girl, she moved to Gainesville and began city life. Shortly after arriving in Gainesville, Geraldine was introduced to a local Army Air Corps veteran, Jerry E. Douglas. According to all accounts, he swept her off her feet and they were married after a short courtship. A daughter, Pam, and a son, Jerry, soon followed. Geraldine was an excellent seamstress and took pride in making her own clothes and those of her young children. She continued making clothes for her and her daughter for many years and later enjoyed applying the newest sewing methods in making clothes for her young grandchildren. After a career of more than 25 years in the savings and loan industry Geraldine retired and pursued her entrepreneurial dreams. After extensive studies and research, Geraldine established the first day spa in Gainesville which she always referred to lovingly as “my little store”. She was a trail blazer in the industry and successfully managed the business for many years. Geraldine based her business on the principals of continuing education, service to others and personal integrity. Being an active and lifelong supporter of the community, Geraldine practiced her belief that service to the community was of paramount importance. Geraldine always focused on the positive in people as well as in situations and conducted her life according to her father’s advice, “Do your best in all things, never lower your standards, and be true to yourself and others”. Geraldine was admired in the community as a dignified and gracious lady with perfectly coiffed hair, impeccably dressed, who was never in a hurry and marched to the beat of her own drum. After the death of her husband of 65 years and the closing of her business, Geraldine filled her days educating herself and others on the benefits of proper nutrition and personal wellness. She will be greatly missed by her children; daughter, Pam Latsko (Carl), son, Jerry; grandchildren, Rief Lee, Robyn Lee, and Kevin Lee; great grandchildren, Seth Giles, Morgan Giles and Olivia Lee; brothers, Charles Falkner (Helen), Ralph Falkner (Shirley); and her “little friend”, Sugar. Geraldine was laid to rest in the family ancestral cemetery at Old Providence Baptist Church in Columbia County, December 9, 2015. The family wishes to thank the wonderful people of Haven Hospice for the excellent care provided for Geraldine and for their thoughtful and compassionate support and guidance for the family members.

We thought about you yesterday, And days before that too. We think of you in silence, We often speak your name. All we have are memories, Your memory is our keepsake, with which we will never part. God has you in his keeping, we have you in our hearts. It broke our hearts to lose you, But you didn’t go alone. For a part of us went with you… The day God called you Home.

Richard, or Dick as most friends knew him, was a gentle man with a huge heart and giant passions—literature and especially all things Herman Melville, classical music, nature, and his wife, Audrey Clark. He lived his life as he once wrote, “Love your neighbor for his sake, not yours. Let’s all enrich this world, staving off death with good health and good will.” Dick was a wonderful, brilliant, and steadfast man, husband, and father. He will be missed greatly. Dick was born October 19, 1927 in Fort Wayne, IN. He served in the Army after high school and was stationed as a weather observer in the Aleutian Islands. Dick then went on to earn his B.A. in English at DePauw University and his M.A. at Brown University where he met his first wife, Elspeth Hart Doenges. His entire professional career was spent at the University of Bridgeport where he was Associate Professor of English for many decades and then later served as Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences. In retirement Dick enjoyed travelling, and it was on one of these trips to Europe after the death of Elspeth that he met Audrey and found love again. He soon built a new life with Audrey and her family matching the devotion his children continued to enjoy. In addition to his wife Audrey Clark of Gainesville, Dick is survived by his brother Norman Doenges and his wife Pam Doenges of Hanover, NH; his son Richard Crawford Doenges, his wife Mary Beth Brown and grandsons, Ryan H. Doenges and Douglas B. Doenges of Olympia, WA; his son James M. Doenges and his wife Teresa H. Doenges of Littleton, CO; and his daughter Catherine E.

He served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946 in Battery B 903rd Field Artillery Batallion as part of the first Division to cross the Rhine River into Germany. After his service, he returned to Auburn where he received his Bachelor’s Degree in Journalism. After working as a Field Secretary for Sigma Pi Fraternity, Dr. Hooper completed a Master’s Degree at the University of Missouri. While working in Advertising in Mobile, AL, he met and married the love of his life, the late Elizabeth Ann Snipes while singing in the church choir in Bay Minette.

He completed his PhD at the University of Southern Illinois in 1964 and moved to Gainesville to join the burgeoning Journalism School at the University of Florida. During his twenty-seven year tenure at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications, Dr. Hooper taught virtually every Advertising course offered, but was especially known for teaching Radio and Television Advertising and the Advertising Ethics Course. Dr. Hooper worked tirelessly to establish the graduate program and chaired and served on numerous PhD committees. Upon realizing that there was not a national organization for Public Relations students, Dr. Hooper led the effort to establish the first (Alpha) chapter of PRSSA in the country at UF.

He played in school bands in high school and college, was his company’s bugler in the Army, played in dance bands, performed in local theater productions, sang in his church choir wherever he lived, and was one of the founding members of the Gainesville Civic Chorus. He even sang while grading papers, though often filling in his own funny lyrics to popular songs. A lifelong lover of books and learning, he was an avid reader, preferring biographies, books about language and grammar, and history. A master of trivia, he was the ultimate answer man for books, history, television, movies and music. Though reserved in public, he had a dry sense of humor and a keen wit. He loved puns. He read the newspaper every day, several magazines, and every piece of mail that came, every day. He was never far from a crossword puzzle, and completed them methodically, top to bottom, left to right, with a medium length, number two pencil. Most of all Dr. Hooper loved his family and was a devoted son, brother, husband, father, uncle, and grandfather. After retiring from the University of Florida in 1991, he spent his time visiting family, gardening with Betty, doing jigsaw puzzles, working crossword puzzles, reading, and building lego creations with his grandchildren. A sweet and kind man, he always managed to find the positive in any situation, and show his appreciation to those around him. He will be missed.

Roberts, “Leon,” WW II veteran and retired University Professor, died in Gainesville, Florida on August 5, 2015. He was born Feb. 27th, 1921 near the village of Garard’s Fort, Pennsylvania to Warren H. and Celeste G. Roberts. During his early college years, Leonidas participated in two government sponsored flight training programs covering primary and aerobatic maneuvers. Dutifully joining the Navy in July, 1941, he had additional, rigorous, military flight instructor training. He was designated Naval Aviator No. 10762 and was assigned duty as a flight instructor. Duty assignments included service as a Flight Instructor in several categories of Navy aircraft as well as patrol-bomber missions involving anti-shipping/anti-sub patrols and air-sea rescues in combat areas. He served with Patrol Bombing Squadron Seventeen (VPB-17) throughout the Western Pacific as a Patrol Plane Commander of the Martin “Mariner,” a twenty nine ton twin-engine flying boat manned by a crew of twelve. Long-range patrols in the Mariner were flown from bases in the Marshall Islands, the Marianas, Ulithi atoll, and the Philippine Islands. One type of mission flown by CDR. Roberts in his Mariner (Squadron No. 13) involved all night (sunset to sunrise) patrol along the China coast at an altitude of only 300 feet. One Squadron MARINER met disaster from enemy destroyer fire on a similar mission. For his war-time service, he received many campaign medals and awards including The Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal. A post war CO of Gainesville’s Naval Reserve Research Company, 6-4, he retired with the rank of Commander, USNR (Ret.). Post war academic life included degrees from Waynesburg College, West Virginia University, and the University of Florida—all with mathematics emphasis. Dr. Roberts joined the University of Florida faculty in1949 as an instructor in The Comprehensive Physical Sciences, a position with flexibility for concurrent participation in other academic disciplines. At the time of scarce or non-existent facilities, he co-initiated campus star parties utilizing his home built portable Newtonian telescope. Further involvement lead to the teaching of astronomy courses. Other activities over the years included significant contributions to physical science texts and syllabi, teaching mathematics through calculus and differential equations. With the eventual establishment of the University’s department of astronomy and his simultaneous appointment as a joint faculty member therein, Dr. Roberts acquired a very diverse teaching agenda over the years with options from physical science and astronomy courses, including celestial navigation, observatory sessions, and planetarium lectures. In the early days of radio astronomy, Dr. Roberts played a small but unique role in its local research by carrying a signal emitter in his personal aircraft and flying a specified track over the ground for calibrating the antenna used in studies of Jupiter’s radio emissions. His personal aircraft was also used in scouting for observatory sites and many other utility purposes. Capitalizing on his extensive military flight instructing experience, CDR Roberts continued this activity well into civilian life by providing flight instruction to special friends. Impending health problems terminated his aviation involvement at age 65. After 40 years of service to the University of Florida, he retired as Professor Emeritus of Physical Sciences and Astronomy. Dr. Roberts took much pride in his wife’s contributions to the Gainesville community as a pianist and a music teacher. On a different level,-during his more senior years, he found great pleasure in the challenge and fun of Barbershop harmony. Immediate survivors include a son, David H. Roberts, granddaughter Paige Brownlee Baker, and his sister, Virginia Glidden of Greene County, Pennsylvania. He was predeceased by his loving wife of 70 years, Mary Fabisinski Roberts, daughter, Claudia Leslie Roberts-Baker.

He also served on the original committee appointed by the Gainesville City Commission in the mid-seventies to study, make recommendations and promote downtown redevelopment in Gainesville.

Candace was born in Fukuoka, Japan to Major William A. Anderson and Faye W. Anderson, the second eldest of five children. She moved to Gainesville, Florida in 1960 when her father retired from military service. After graduating from Gainesville High School, she earned her undergraduate degree from Florida State University and graduate degree in Counseling from Purdue University. She returned to Gainesville in 1988 as Senior Family Therapist with Charter Springs Hospital in Ocala, Florida. In 1992, she opened her private practice in Gainesville, Florida as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor and continued her work in private practice until her illness necessitated her retirement April 2011. Candace loved working with couples, families and individuals in her counseling practice and felt so blessed that she was one of those lucky people who had chosen a career that was “a perfect fit”, rewarding and challenging – a career that provided daily opportunities for her own personal growth as well as her clients’. She said, “I thoroughly enjoyed the unique, emotionally intimate relationship between therapist and client.” She felt it was exciting and fulfilling to help individuals help themselves as they grew stronger and more in control of their lives. Candace’s spirituality and the principles that guided her life were based on the Humanist philosophy which emphasizes the personal worth of each individual and ability to create her/his own happiness and well-being, the capacity for self actualization in achieving our highest potential and the importance of taking personal responsibility for our lives. She expanded her focus in 1993 to include working with prospective adoptive parents and birth parents. During her career, she helped hundreds of prospective parents build their families through adoption. She treasured these experiences and felt deeply rewarded when grieving childless couples became loving parents and caring, unselfish birth parents had the opportunity to participate fully in the adoption process choosing loving, safe homes for their children. Candace really enjoyed life as she professed “never to be bored by all there was to experience and learn”. She loved singing, playing her guitar, ballroom dancing, kayaking the rivers, making beautiful quilts and art projects, cooking and a host of other activities. She was a striver, a doer, a loving person, and an assertive person who valued honesty and integrity. She was not afraid to take risks in life and stand up for what she believed. She will be remembered as a loving wife, mother, and gran-mama as well as a devoted friend and respected colleague. She is survived by her husband who was devoted to her and lovingly cared for her in her illness; Lynn A. Williams, two wonderful children; Erin Candace Tyler and Ryman Vaughn Koester, three precious grandchildren; David James Tyler, Liam Alun Gardner and Avery “Finn” Gardner, her sister; Deborah Anderson (Crosby), two brothers; Greg Anderson (Melanie) and Stan Anderson (Melinda), four nieces; Susan, Sophie, Tasha and Tamara, three nephews; Lucas, Ian and Connor, great nieces and nephews; Saylor, Haven, Emmy and Anderson, four endearing aunts; Mona, Marcia, Kay and Diane.

She taught or substituted in most grades and subjects in the schools of Florida, but most of her career was spent teaching English. Alyce encouraged her students to be the best that they could be. To motivate integrity, she stressed this quote written by Shakespeare: “To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou cans’t not then be false to any man.” Years later one of her greatest joys was having students call and send notes telling her how her life lessons had helped sustain them throughout their lives.

They had one daughter, Peggy Alyce. After Albert’s death in 1976, Alyce moved to Gainesville to be near their daughter, Peggy and her husband John Kirkpatrick. In Gainesville she enjoyed her retirement years serving her church and being an avid Gator fan who attended the games and cheered on the Gators into her late nineties. She was a member of Trinity United Methodist Church, ALERT, the Daylily Garden Circle, Alpha Delta Pi Sorority, Phi Kappa Phi, Delta Kappa Gamma and several bridge groups.

A Republican whose philosophy was to talk about issues and not personalities, Dr. Casey would strive to work across the aisle for the betterment of the people of Florida. He was fond of saying, “I love Democrats – I raised three of them.” Ordained as a Baptist minister since 1952, Dr. Casey’s deep and abiding faith in God guided him throughout his life and inspired his generous efforts to serve others and work to promote racial and gender equality.

As a physician, Dr. Casey delivered meals and other necessities to patients in need, in addition to providing medical treatment.

During the 1970s, Dr. Casey became an avid runner and fitness enthusiast, eventually running the New York Marathon in 1983.
