About Candelilla wax
Candelilla wax is an all natural wax derived from the leaves of the small Candelilla shrub. The Candelilla shrub is native to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. This wax can be said to be naturally organic due to how it is grown and harvested. It has a lovely characteristic yellow color. Because of its hard and brittle nature, it is able to act as a hardener to skin and hair care products. It is also used in the food industry and has a high temperature ranging from 155.3–162.5 °F. This makes it a great stabilizer in creams, salves, ointments, pomades, lotions and several other beauty products.  Its mild aromatic, opaque and translucent presentation ensures that it does not significantly interfere with the end products that it is added to. Vegans love this plant based alternative to beeswax as it is able to emulsify almost as well as the good old bee by product which is a major player in the beauty industry.
Candelilla wax: A major player in the beauty industry. 
While there are many artificial waxes that are used in the beauty industry, it’s not uncommon to have natural products that can produce better results. Candelilla wax is one of such unique natural products. Plant waxes like Candelilla are often included in the development of beauty products because they help keep emulsions intact. Acting as a binder to prevent oils and liquids from separating in your favorite creamy products, Candelilla wax can be used to enrich creamy products like cream foundations, conditioners for curly hair and smoothing hair pomades.
Candelilla wax: skin and hair care benefits:
Candelilla has many benefits, including serving as a thickening and hardening agent, a synthetics-free emollient and nourishing skin conditioner. It is not only effective in binding ingredients, but the unique quality of Candelilla wax also makes it safe for skin. It has also been found to soothe and soften the skin. Candelilla wax possesses unique skin protective properties that make it an important ingredient in the manufacturing of hair care products, cosmetics, lotions and more.
Candelilla wax for skin care
This amazing wax is used in the culinary industry and may be a safe alternative to trans products. Because of its moisturizing qualities, candelilla wax can provide relief to dry and aging skin, diminishing the appearance of stretch marks, wrinkles and age spots. Candelilla wax deals with scaly skin and the appearance of stretch marks because it supports collagen production. It functions in a way similar to jojoba oil which is considered a liquid wax by guarding against loss of moisture to the skin. Candelilla wax naturally enhances the viscosity of the oils and butters that it is mixed with and as such, it is an excellent ingredient in skin moisturizing products. Candelilla wax has anti-inflammatory properties that calms your scaly skin.
Candelilla wax for hair care
Candelilla wax helps to ensure moisturized hair. Ever moved your fingers through your hair and felt worried? Chances are, you pulled some of your hair out or it was as dry as the desert. The natural oils in the candelilla wax facilitate detangling due to its film forming capabilities. This wax also acts as an excellent sealant. It fills up your follicles which means less hair falling off. People usually focus a lot of energy on their hair but your scalp is also affected by low moisture. Candelilla wax replaces this lost moisture and lost natural oils when added as an ingredient in hair conditioning products. It also gives a glossy finish to hair and can act as a great scalp treatment
Unlike many chemical based ingredients used in the beauty industry, there are no known side effects of using candelilla wax. That is why this wax plant is regarded as the darling of the cosmetic industry. It can blend into any potion, lotion, cream, oil or other liquids. It is extensively used in the beauty industry because it is considered very safe and non-toxic to hair or skin. In addition, it is also an odorless non-irritant ingredient that works wonders for both hair and skin.
Candelilla wax vs Beeswax 
These two waxes are undoubtedly close contenders in the beauty industry. Over the years, the increased demand for plant based ingredients in the beauty industry has led to the proliferation of candelilla wax. An important distinguishing factor between the two waxes is the fact that candelilla wax is plant-based while beeswax secreted by honey bees is an animal by product. Candelilla wax is also naturally harder and more brittle than beeswax. It has a higher melting point and also melts relatively slower than beeswax. Individuals with pollen or honey allergies can also safely use candelilla wax because they are both highly suitable for skin and hair care product formulations.
Candelilla wax and beeswax are both excellent emollients but candelilla wax has been found to be more dense in consistency than beeswax. High quality beeswax has a slight honey aroma while candelilla wax is mostly odorless, making it more flexible in terms of taking on the scent you decide to incorporate into it. Beeswax is also a natural humectant (attracts moisture) while candelilla wax is not. Nonetheless, both waxes are suitable particularly for DIY hair and skincare. They are both natural products that can provide stability and stiffness to an end product. They are both key players in the natural and clean beauty industry.
Simple vegan lip balm recipe using candelilla wax
It is important to remember that candelilla wax is harder than beeswax so while its a good substitute, they are not exactly equivalent. It takes longer to melt and longer to set after melting. It makes an excellent balm because of its anti-inflammatory and moisturizing capabilities.

Ingredients


1 tsp of Candelilla Wax
6 tsp of organic virgin coconut oil
2 tsp of organic refined Shea Butter
15 drops of peppermint essential oil.




Instructions



Melt the candelilla wax and shea butter in a double boiler on low to medium heat.


Once melted, mix in your oils and stir vigorously to incorporate the ingredients together.


Add your fragrance or essential oils of choice.


Immediately pour the mixture into already prepared lip balm containers. Please note that your mixture will start to solidify immediately but you can melt it down again to ensure there are no lumps in your finished products.


Let it cool down and solidify completely for as long as possible.


Apply on your lips as desired. You can also make body balms with this same recipe


Yield: about 1.5 oz (7-8 plastic lip balm containers).
