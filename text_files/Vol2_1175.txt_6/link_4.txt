BENEFITS of SILICON OIL (DIMETHICONE 350):
Silicon Oil (Dimethicone 350) fluids reduce the surface tension of a formulating allowing it to spread easily across the skin or hair. 
They can form a barrier on the skin to prevent moisture loss, act as lubricants or as skin-feel modifiers bringing a silky, invisible feel to emulsions.
Finally they can be used in colour cosmetics to enable 'oil free' claims.
These medium viscosity Silicon Oil (Dimethicone 350) fluids help achieve a more substantive and moisturising finish to formulations while still remaining light and oil-free. 
They can assist in making a formulation less tacky and are effective conditioning actives.

STRENGTHS of SILICON OIL (DIMETHICONE 350):
Silicon Oil (Dimethicone 350) is a very versatile ingredient that improves the skin feel of anything I’ve ever tried it in. 
Silicon Oil (Dimethicone 350) is non-irritating (suitable for those with sensitive skin) and will not aggravate conditions like Pityrosporum Folliculitis (a.k.a. fungal acne).

ALTERNATIVES & SUBSTITUTIONS of SILICON OIL (DIMETHICONE 350):
In products where you are using Silicon Oil (Dimethicone 350) at 5% or less, you could try a higher viscosity version, like Silicon Oil (Dimethicone 350) or Dimethicone 1000. 
With that low of a usage rate, Silicon Oil (Dimethicone 350) will be diluted so much that the thicker version is unlikely to impact the end product much (if a very low viscosity is important to the final product [i.e. if it’s supposed to mist] then swapping in a higher viscosity of dimethicone probably isn’t the best idea).
You could also try rich, slippy oils as an alternative (something like oat oil), though these will not offer the same level of de-tack-ifying and skin smoothing. 
The importance of this is very formula dependent, and I also find perceptions of stickiness/tackiness are very personal. 
If you’re not very sensitive to stickiness (or just plain ol’ don’t mind it) you are less likely to notice the loss of silicone in a formulation.
Dimethicone 1.5 is not a good alternative for Silicon Oil (Dimethicone 350); the 1.5 version is ultra-thin and lightweight, and evaporates quickly. 
It is much closer to Cyclomethicone and Cyclopentasiloxane than Dimethicone 350.

WHAT IS HIGH VISCOSITY PURE SILICONE FLUID?
High Viscosity Pure Silicone Fluids are clear, colorless and odorless linear Polydimethylsiloxane oils (Polydimethylsiloxanes) that range in viscosities from 5,000cSt, 10,000cSt, 12,500cSt, 30,000, 60,000cSt, & 100,000cSt.
They are characterized by their high damping action, excellent lubricity, inertness to plastics, rubbers and metals, high dielectric strength, high resistance to shear, thermal stability, wide service temperature range and low viscosity change at temperature. 
Due to their high viscosity, inertness and lubricity, High Viscosity Silicone Fluids are widely used as lubricant for o-rings, gaskets, valves and seals.
Polydimethylsilicone liquids are blend of polymers with linear and branched structure.
