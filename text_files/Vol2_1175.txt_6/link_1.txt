                            XIAMETER® PMX-1184 Silicone Fluid is a low molecular weight siloxane polymer. The bulk of composition falls between 1 and 2cSt with some higher molecular components, which may enhance solubility and/or sensory benefits. Unlike other volatile carriers, it does not cool the skin when it evaporates. This cost effective, linear silicone fluid is non-staining on fabric and can be used to reduce whiteness and tack in antiperspirants and deodorants formulations. It can also be used as a substantive in hair care applications and to impart a pleasant skin feel in skin care products. view less
