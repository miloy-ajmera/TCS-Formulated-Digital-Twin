                                        Materials: golden jojoba, attar of rose, almond oil, beeswax, glycerine

    








        
        Description
            
            









                    We have the French chemist Michel Chevrel to thank for glycerine, named for the greek word glukeros meaning sweet. Glycerine came to its popularity in the late 1800‚Äôs where it was touted for its ‚Äúpowerful beautifying effect on the old and young, rendering skin supple and soft.‚Äù After making this recipe, we agree. A little goes a long way since it is thick and concentrated. This is an 1884 recipe with only the spermaceti (whale wax) being substituted, melted over open flame and hand-whipped.From our customers:-PLEASE never stop making this. This is a life-changer. Thank you!-I just wanted to tell you from the bottom of my heart, Thank you. I've been wearing masks 8+ hours a day at work, so my cheeks and nose get so dry and chafed, but your skincare has kept me from bleeding, and falling to pieces! Every morning I apply the basil souffle to soothe and prepare for the day, and at night I use the Milk of Roses or Lavender to cleanse, and Rose Glycerine cream to help repair the damage. Makes all the difference! The situation currently makes things pretty hard, but your products are a light in the dark. I tell everyone I can about you, and I really can't say enough.-What an incredible cream! I have used it for two nights now and my skin is glowing!-This is magic! Smells like heaven and makes my skin sooooo soft. It goes a super long way. Will absolutely buy more.The weather can really affect a product especially during hot/cold months. This recipe is emulsified naturally with beeswax, not a chemical emulsifier such as Polysorbate or EWax. If product becomes frozen simply place on counter to defrost and stir. If product is heated during shipping, stir as it cools. Creamy or fluffy, this product works all consistencies. Original recipe was used as both a cold cream and skin cream. We would also suggest using as a deep nourishing night treatment perfect for winter skin. This treasure of a recipe is super emollient and rich. Best for areas such as chest, elbows, knees or any areas that may need extra enriching. A little goes very far.The tester size (about size of a quarter) will supply 1 or 2 applications. If you have any skin reactions, sensitive skin or skin that may be prone to reaction, these testers are an option to check sensitivity. These will not give you numerous applications. When tested as a wipe-off cold cream, it takes a while to sink into skin, however, did leave face soft and velvety by morning. Unlike body butter which may leave stains on clothing, the glycerine leaves no trace. Taken from a book titled ‚ÄúGlycerine and its uses in 1865, ‚Äú‚Ä¶glycerin can be removed without unpleasant friction and does not soil and grease the garments and bed clothing.‚Äù  Under makeup, this cream was additionally used to adhere powder to the face.

You can find it here:https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/2ndchancesanctuary/tools/listings/query:glycerine,sort:price/950037338This 1896 historical version has the addition of tragacanth along with a higher content of glycerin - very emollient and nourishingPlease Note: We are changing over to an all-recyclable cap rather than the aluminum cap with foam liner.

Sustainable and chemical-free practices are used including rotational grazing, herbal worming, vermiculture and natural composting - we would simply have it no other way. Mother Nature knows best... We believe in simple, nourishing ingredients. Many herbs are grown on the farm for use in our solar infusions along with honey, beeswax and pollen. Wild foraging in our woods yields witch hazel, mushrooms, peppermint, pine resin and many other nourishing treats. All body products are developed and tested from the ground up. We do not purchase premade bases - this only takes away from the joy of creating... and knowing our product is indeed pure. All products are lovingly made in small batches. No synthetic fillers, sulfate, palm oil, propylene glycol and petroleum byproduct are used. About our animals:Some have come to us through farm rescues, others due to neglect, some through an owners death and some left on our doorstep.We have loved deaf and blind sheep, a sweet hen found in a roadside trash bag, a pregnant, undernourished goat with mange and fed baby squirrels with a syringe.Our animals are allowed to wander as they please. Regardless of how they became part of our farm, they live out their lives happy and healthy with endless hugs... as it should be.

                    I absolutely love this cream! Even the smallest amount on my face before bedtime has me waking up so hydrated, even while combatting this winter weather! Such a lovely, subtle, authentically rose fragrance!

                    This cream has really helped my face. It looks brighter and looks and feels so much softer. I love that this company is an animal rescue too.
