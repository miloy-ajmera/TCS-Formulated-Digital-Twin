Sierra Madre Sun Cream SPF 30





          FEATURES
    

          INGREDIENTS
    

          HOW TO USE
    


UVA and UVB protection with moisturizing and nourishing properties that help protect the skin from harsh exposure to sun, wind, and water.
• excellent sun protection for all skin types
• refreshing
• water resistant, rehydrating
• absorbs quickly into skin


CONTAINS: (6% zinc oxide, 5% avobenzone, and 1% titanium dioxide), aqua (deionized water), beeswax (apis melllifera), butryospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, enzyme lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase, lecithin, olea euopaea (olive) oil, organic prunus dulcis (almond) flavor, sesamum indicum (sesame) oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil, and tocopheryl acetate (vitamin-E). the avobenzone has been in the sierra Madre for over 10 years the reason we switched is because It is the stablizers that are toxic not the avobenzone itself. We have always used a neo heliopan. We used to use the oxctyl methyl cinnimate but that was found to be a hormone disrupter and bad for the reefs so we switched to the avobenzone. We also do offer a couple different sunscreens that do not contain that ingredient.


DIRECTIONS: Apply 15 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply at least every two hours. Immediately after swimming, sweating or towel drying. *Protect this product from excessive heat and direct sunlight.
CAUTION: FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. Do not use on damaged or broken skin. When using this product keep out of eyes. Rinse with water to remove. Stop use and consult physician if irritation or rash develops. Keep out of reach of children. If product is swallowed, get medical attention or contact poison control center immediately.
