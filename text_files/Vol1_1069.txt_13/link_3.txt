   This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/683,841 filed Jan. 7, 2010, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/143,317, filed Jan. 8, 2009; U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/181,353, filed May 27, 2009; U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/160,946 filed Mar. 17, 2009; and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/181,165 filed May 26, 2009, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present application is directed to compositions for enhancing nail and cuticle growth.
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Nails, including toenails and fingernails, are primarily composed of the protein keratin. Fingernails and toenails are living tissue. The nail is formed in a pocket of skin which has grown inward and is called the nail matrix. This area generates the nail and is also called the root of the nail. The outer layer of the matrix contains specialized cells that create the keratin that grows out as the nail plate.
    The nail plate is the commonly referred to as a fingernail or toenail.
    The nail bed is the finger tissue or toe tissue that supports the nail. Nails grow continuously throughout a person's life, growing approximately at an average rate of 3 millimeters a month. Fingernails may require 3 to 6 months to re-grow completely, and toenails require approximately 12 to 18 months. Actual growth rate is dependent upon age, gender, season, exercise level, diet, and hereditary factors.
    The treatment of fingernail and toe nail problems due to various conditions such as anemia, vitamin or mineral deficiency, onycohrrhexis, kidney and liver disorders, psoriasis, vascular disease (e.g., Raynaud's disease) and heart disease often result in poor nail growth, vertical trenches, pitting, cracking, horizontal lines, lack of thickness and strength, lack of smoothness and tendency to tear remains a significant problem. Despite the development of numerous treatments such as the use of nail enhancement and hardening polishes, protein elixirs such as bovine collagen emulsions, various types of wearable protective fingernail covers and other similar products, there remains a significant need for treatments which actually accelerate the growth of nails and cuticles and restore the health of nails and cuticles. The problem with current treatments for improving nail health is that they are mainly cosmetic in nature, largely ineffective, are generally taken systemically (e.g., biotin and silicon) and time consuming. There is a need for compositions which actually enhance or accelerate the growth of nails and cuticles and restore nails and cuticles to their natural health to thicken, strengthen and smooth the nail.
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention is directed to compositions and methods for stimulating the growth of nails (including both toenails and fingernails) and cuticles (eponychium) in a mammal, including humans. The compositions may be administered topically to the nail bed, nail matrix, the end or tip of the nail and cuticle in an amount effective to increase nail growth and thicken, strengthen and smooth the nail and cuticle. The composition may be administered once a day, twice a day, three times a day, four times a day, twice a week, three times a week, four times a week, five times a week and six times a week. The composition may come in a kit comprising a vial or dispenser containing the composition and an applicator brush.
    The compositions of the present invention include but are not limited to emulsions, microemulsions, reverse emulsions, solutions, colloids, suspensions, dispersions, gels, pastes and polishes and may optionally contain an active compound such as cyclosporine, in particular, cyclosporine A retinoids (including but not limited to tazortene), biotin, and silicone may be included.
    More specifically, the present invention is directed to oil-in-water emulsions optionally containing an active compound wherein the emulsions may contain at least one oil and/or surfactant. In one embodiment the emulsion contains castor oil, polysorbate 80, glycerine, NaOH and may optionally contain polyacrylates such as carbomer and PEMULENÂ® and other additional ingredients.
    One possible solution of the present invention includes 0.5% w/v carboxy methyl cellulose, 0.9% w/v glycerine, 0.25% carnitine and 0.25% w/v erythritol and purite. Other preferred emulsions of the present invention are described in the Examples below which optionally may omit or contain cyclosporine A:

For example, cyclosporine components can be combined with carriers which form emulsions upon mixing with water. Such emulsions are described, for example, and without limitation, in Cavanak U.S. Pat. No. 4,388,307, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.
    The compositions of the present invention are applied topically on the nail by an applicator and can be administered once or multiple times-a-day. In accordance with the present invention, emulsion formulations work to enhance or accelerate the growth of nails, including thickness and length, and cuticles and restore nails and cuticle to their natural health to thicken, strengthen and smooth the nail. The compositions of the present invention may be used for treatment of disorders of the toenail and fingernail such as nail psoriasis, psoriatic nail dystrophy, brittle nail syndrome, increasing nail length and thickness, onychia, onychiagryposis, onychia trophia, onychocryptosis, onychodystrophy, onychogryposis, onycholysis, onychomadesis, onychauxis, onychomycosis, onychorrhexis, tinea unguium, onychophosis, onychoptosis, paronychia, pseudomonas, pterygium and pterygium inversum unguis, koilonychia, subungual hematoma or other trauma to the nail, folic acid deficiency, leukonychia, nail patella syndrome, melanonychia, protein deficiency, brittle and peeling nails, methyl methacrylate damaged nails, vitamin C deficiency, vitamin deficiency, tinea unguis, thinning nails associated with lichen planus, Raynaud's disease, beeding associated with rheumatoid arthritis, beau's lines, and Mee's lines associated with certain kinds of poisoning.
    In addition these compositions will contribute to nail health to increase overall global nail health, increase nail strength, increase nail growth rate and thickness, decrease brittle nail syndrome, decrease weak nails, decrease nail pitting, decrease nail cracking, decrease nail splitting, decrease nail dullness, decrease nail roughness, (trachyonychia) decrease nail raggedness, decrease nail peeling, decrease nail fraying, decrease nails tendency to tear, decrease nail layering (lamellar onychoschizia), decrease Beau's lines, decrease onycohmadesis, decrease oncholysis, decrease onychorrhexis, decrease nail fragility, decrease nail paronychia, and decrease nail onychomycosis.
    In alternative embodiments of the present invention such as when comprising water-in-oil emulsions, the emulsions include hydrophobic components such as a pharmaceutically acceptable oil. The hydrophobic component may be present in an effective amount, for example, in an amount of up to about 0.01%-90% w/v but preferably from about 0.01-10% by w/v, 0.05%-5% w/v, 0.05%-2% w/v or 1.0%-1.5% by w/v. Examples of useful pharmaceutically acceptable oils include vegetable oils, animal oils, mineral oils, synthetic oils and the like and mixtures thereof. In alternate embodiments, the hydrophobic component may comprise or consist of one or higher fatty acid glycerides. In preferred embodiments, the hydrophobic component comprises or consists of castor oil.
    Surfactants may also be present in amounts of up to about 0.01-10% by w/v, 0.05%-5% w/v, 0.05%-2% w/v or 1.0%-1.5% by w/v. Surfactants may include alcohols including carboxylated and ethoxylated alcohols, amine oxides, block polymers, fatty acids including carboxylic fatty acids, ethoxylated alkyl phenols, ethoxylated fatty esters, glycerol esters, lanolin-based derivatives, lignin derivatives, methyl esters, mono- and tri-glycerides, polyethylene glycols, polymeric surfactants, propoxylated and ethoxylated fatty acids, alcohols, or alkyl phenols, protein based surfactants, sucrose and glucose esters and derivatives, In preferred embodiments, the surfactant is a polysorbate and in particular polysorbate 80 but other surfactants may be used.
    Any known pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants may be used, including nonionic, anionic, cationic, and combinations thereof. Nonionic surfactants are preferred, and especially those surfactants having a hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) of 10 or more. Alternatively, certain combinations of high- and low-HLB surfactants may be utilized; preferably, such mixed surfactants are used in ratio such that the aggregate surfactant HLB (when weighted according to proportions used) remains in excess of 10.
    Examples of suitable surfactants include, but are not limited to, polyoxyethylene derivatives of natural or hydrogenated vegetable oils such as castor oil; polyoxyethylene-sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as mono-, di- and tri-lauryl, palmityl, stearyl and oleyl esters; alkyl/dialykyl sulfate, sulfonate or sulfosuccinate salts such as sodium lauryl sulfate and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate; polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters; phospholipids such as lecithins; transesterification products of natural vegetable oil triglycerides and polyalkylene polyols; sorbitan fatty acid esters; pentaerythritol fatty acid esters; polyoxyethylene glycol alkyl ethers and esters; and the like. The surfactants may be used alone or in combination.
    Examples of specific surfactants which may be used include, without limitation, polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives, such as polyoxyethylene glycerol triricinoleate polyoxyl 35 castor oil (CREMOPHORÂ® EL, available from BASF Corporation), and polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil (CREMOPHORÂ® RH40, available from BASF Corporation); mono-fatty acid esters of poloxyethylene (20) sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (TWEENÂ® 80), polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monostearate (TWEENÂ® 60), polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monopalmitate (TWEENÂ® 40), and polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate (TWEENÂ® 20) (all available from ICI Surfactants, Wilmington, Del.); polyoxyethylene glycol 200 monostearate (MYRJÂ® 52, available from Calgene Chemicals, Skokie, Ill.); polyglycerol esters with a HLB of 10 or greater, such as decablyceryl mono- and dioleate and the like; and mixtures thereof.
    In some instances (as when the compositions are prepared as semi-solids), it may be advantageous to use at least one additional low-HLB surfactant along with one or more of the above high-HLB surfactant. Examples of low-HLB auxiliary surfactants which may be used include, but are not limited to, polyglycerol oleates (such as CAPROLÂ® 10G40); lecithins; glyceryl monooleate or monolinoleate mixtures (such as MYVEROLÂ® 18-99 or 18-92); propylene glycol laurate; and sorbitan oleates such as sorbitan monooleate (SPANÂ® 80), sorbitan trioleate (SPANÂ® 85), and sorbitan sesquioleate (SPANÂ® 20) (all available from ICI Surfactants, Wilmington, Del.). The surfactant phase may comprise about 10% to 90% by weight of the composition. Preferably the surfactant comprises about 20% to about 70% of the composition, and more preferably about 40% to about 60%, by weight.
    1. Cyclosporine
    As stated previously, the compositions of the present invention may contain cyclosporine or other active compounds. Cyclosporines are a group of nonpolar cyclic oligopeptides with known immunosuppressant activity. Cyclosporine A, along with several other minor metabolites, as well as cyclosporine B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z, have been identified. In addition, derivatives, salts and the like of such cyclosporines and a number of synthetic analogs have been prepared and may be useful in the present invention. The use of cyclosporine-A and cyclosporine A derivatives to treat ophthalmic conditions has been the subject of various patents, for example Ding et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,979; Garst U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,254,860; 6,350,442, and 7,368,436; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated in its entirely herein by reference.
    In general, commercially available cyclosporines may contain a mixture of several individual cyclosporines which all share a cyclic peptide structure consisting of eleven amino acid residues with a total molecular weight of about 1,200, but with different substituents or configurations of some of the amino acids.
    The term âcyclosporine componentâ as used herein is intended to include any individual member of the cyclosporine group, salts thereof, derivatives thereof, analogs thereof and mixtures thereof, as well as mixtures of two or more individual cyclosporines salts thereof, derivatives thereof, analogs thereof and mixtures thereof.
    Particularly preferred cyclosporine components include, without limitation, cyclosporine A, derivatives of cyclosporine A, salts of cyclosporine A and the like and mixtures thereof. Cyclosporine A is an especially useful cyclosporine component.
    The chemical structure for cyclosporine A is represented by Formula 1:
  



 
 



    As used herein the term âderivativesâ of a cyclosporine refer to compounds having structures sufficiently similar to the cyclosporine so as to function in a manner substantially similar to or substantially identical to the cyclosporine, for example, cyclosporine A, in the present methods. Included, without limitation, within the useful cyclosporine A derivatives are those selected from ((R)-methylthio-Sar)3-(4â²-hydroxy-MeLeu) cyclosporine A, ((R)-(Cyclo)alkylthio-Sar)3-(4â²-hydroxy-MeLeu)4-cyclosporine A, and ((R)-(Cyclo)alkylthio-Sar)3-cyclosporine A derivatives described below.
    These cyclosporine derivatives are represented by the following general formulas (II), (III), and (IV) respectively:
  



 
 



  wherein Me is methyl; Alk is 2-6C alkylene or 3-6C cycloalkylene; R is OH, COOH, alkoxycarbonyl, âNR1R2 or N(R3)â(CH2)âNR1R2; wherein R1,R2 is H, alkyl, 3-6C cycloalkyl, phenyl (optionally substituted by halo, alkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino), benzyl or saturated or unsaturated heterocyclyl having 5 or 6 members and 1-3 heteroatoms; or NR1R2 is a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle which may contain a further N, O or S heteroatom and may be alkylated; R3 is H or alkyl and n is 2-4; and the alkyl moieties contain 1-4C.

    In one embodiment, the presently useful compositions are self-emulsifying which, when exposed to an aqueous medium, form fine oil-in-water emulsions with little or no agitation. The property of self-emulsification permits such formulations to be administered in concentrated form, as for example in a soft gelatin or viscous paste. Additionally, emulsions may be prepared by combining a self-emulsifying pre-concentrate with an aqueous medium.
    Previously-disclosed self-emulsifying systems include those in which an active component such as a cycloporine component is combined with mixtures of (i) medium-chain triglycerides and nonionic surfactants, (ii) vegetable oils and partial glycerides, such as polyglycolized glycerides or medium-chain mono- and diglycerides, or (iii) vegetable oils and nonionic surfactants such as polysorbate 80 or PEG-25 glyceryl trioleate.
    In certain self-emulsifying formulations, a âmicroemulsion preconcentrateâ of a cyclosporine component is formed by combining the cyclosporine component with (I) a hydrophilic phase, (II) a lipophilic phase, and (III) a surfactant, as well as optional thickeners, antioxidants or other excipients. Examples of such compositions are disclosed in Hauer et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,625, the disclosure which is hereby incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
    In addition, suitable compositions may include an active such as cyclosporine components in combination with a hydrophilic solvent phase and one or more surfactants, but not containing lipophilic solvents. Such cyclosporine component-containing formulations may be stable, simple to prepare, and have good pharmacokinetic properties.
    Except as otherwise noted elsewhere herein, the compositions of the present invention are administered topically. However, other modes of administration are possible such as systemic administration, for example, oral administration of a capsule or suspension, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection or infusion of a cyclosporine component-containing composition. Topical administration includes ointments, drops, solutions, lacquers (pigmented nail polish or lacquer comprising a separate anti-fungal agent), suspensions or emulsions including a cyclosporine component which may be administered using an applicator system which are well known in the art. Topical formulations, intended for topical administration to the affected tissue area or areas, may be prepared directly, or by combining a cyclosporine component-containing concentrate with a diluent, for example, an aqueous diluent. Such topical formulations may include additional excipients as necessary, for example, to modify consistency of the rate of absorption of the cyclosporine component.
    In preparing the presently useful compositions, the components may be combined in any order with mixing or light agitation to ensure complete blending.
    The compositions of the present invention may be administered in a sufficient amount, and for a sufficient time, as required to provide the desired therapeutic effect of growing fingernails and cuticles. The composition of the present invention may be administered concurrently with other therapeutics such as orally administered anti-fungal agents. The specific therapeutically effective dosage level may be dependent on a number of factors including the specific condition to be treated, the severity of the condition, the activity of the particular cyclosporine component being employed, the specific cyclosporine component-containing composition employed, the time and method of administration, the duration of treatment, and other factors which are well known in the medical arts.
    The following non-limiting examples illustrate certain aspects of the present invention.
 Example 4
   A female patient, age 51, with fingernails with pronounced horizontal ridges on her fingernails (âBeau's Linesâ) and poor nail growth, topically applies four times a day with an applicator brush an emulsion as taught in Example 2, column D. After 7 days of application, the subject's fingernails will experience accelerated growth without the presence of horizontal ridges.
 Example 5
   A male patient, age 44, with fingernails experiencing vertical splitting and pitting possibly due to vitamin or mineral deficiency, topically applies ten times a day with an applicator an emulsion of Example 2, Column C After ten days of application, the subject's fingernails will experience accelerated growth and increased thickness and the disappearance of pits at the portion of the nail growing upward from the eponychium and lunula area of the finger without the presence of pits.
 Example 6
   A female patient, age 45, with brittle (onycohrrhexis) and thinning nails with poor growth, topically applies twelve times a day with a squeezable applicator, an emulsion of Example 2, Column B After ten days of application, the subject's fingernails will experience significant accelerated growth with thicker and less brittle nails emerging from the nail matrix.
 Example 7
   A female patient, age 55, with fingernails with pronounced horizontal ridges (âBeau's Linesâ) and pits on her fingernails with poor nail growth, topically applies to her nails and cuticles twice a day with an applicator brush an emulsion of Example 2, Column A. The emulsion is compounded in a lacquer for application to the nails and cuticles. After 7 days of application, the subject's fingernails will experience accelerated growth without the presence of horizontal ridges.
 Example 8
   A male patient, age 55, with brittle fingernails suffering from onycohrrhexis with and poor nail growth, topically applies to his nails and cuticles twelve times a day with an applicator brush an emulsion of Example 3. After 5 days of application, the subject's fingernails will experience accelerated growth without the presence of horizontal ridges.
 Example 9
   A male patient, age 65, suffering from nail psoriasis, topically applies to his fingernails, toenails, cuticles and between the nail bed and fingernails and toenails, the emulsion of Example 3, twice a day. After 7 days of application, the subject's fingernails and toenails begin thinning and growing normally.
 Example 10
0.05% w/v Cyclosporine Emulsions Vs. Vehicle in a Multi-Patient Study
   The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a cyclosporine emulsion versus emulsion alone both for the treatment of brittle nails and for the enhancement of normal nail growth and texture.
    This was a single center, investigator-blinded (investigator-masked), head-to-head comparison of 0.05% cyclosporine emulsion RestasisÂ® and its vehicle, RefreshÂ® Dry Eye Therapy (which contains no cyclosporine) in 24 patients for the treatment of brittle nails and for the enhancement of normal nail growth and texture. The RefreshÂ® Dry Eye Therapy vehicle has the following formulation: 1.0% w/v polysorbate 80, 2.2% w/v glycerine, 1.25% w/v castor oil, 0.05% w/v pemulin, purified water and at a pH of 7.4.
    Three target fingernails were identified in each subject. Two of the target nails were the two nails that have the most severe signs of brittle nail syndrome. The third target nail was a normal nail or, in the absence of a normal nail, the patient's second-healthiest-appearing nail. The patient's most normal-appearing nail was untreated so that growth in the treated nails can be compared to growth in an untreated normal nail, this was the fourth target nail. Study medication was applied to target nails (the subject may also apply to all nails if they wishes, except one nail which was untreated in order to determine the subject's baseline rate of fingernail growth) for 24 weeks. The target nails were assessed at each visit. Patients were assessed at office visits every four weeks. There was a 12-week follow-up period after cessation of treatment.
    The hypothesis is that daily application of RestasisÂ® and or emulsion alone to nails and nail beds in patients with brittle nails will improve nail texture and enhance nail growth in both affected and unaffected nails. This 36-week study was conducted at one center. Adult male and female patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were screened for eligibility. The principal investigator or his/her designee obtained informed consent from all patients before any protocol-specific procedures were performed.
    The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an improvement in the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), which is a measure of the severity of brittle nail signs and symptoms in two target nails. The target nails were selected as the two fingernails that have the most severe trachyonychia (roughness), lamellar onychoschizia (peeling), or longitudinal cracking/splitting (raggedness). In addition, one normal nail was chosen as the third target nail to evaluate the effect of treatment on normal nail growth and texture. If the patient did not have a normal nail, the third target nail was the patient's second-healthiest-appearing nail. Since nail growth varies considerably among individuals, nail growth and texture of the target normal nail was compared to one untreated nail on the same hand as the target normal nail. The untreated nail was the most normal appearing nail on the same hand as the target normal nail and was the fourth target nail.
    Secondary outcomes included improvement in quality of life as measured by the patient satisfaction questionnaire, difference in rate of growth of the target normal nail compared to the normal untreated nail, and the Physician's Global Improvement Assessment (PGIA) of the four target nails, which reflects the comparison of photographs taken at baseline to those taken during the study.
    An analysis of the data as of Dec. 22, 2009 by Allergan showed the following results. Nail growth in the cyclosporine group was 7.2 mm compared with 6.6 mm in the untreated nail for a 0.64 mm increase. Nail growth in the emulsion group was 5.8 mm compared to 5.7 mm in the untreated nail for a 0.17 mm increase. Cyclosporine increased nail growth 0.5 mm more than emulsion. All other measures improved nails from baseline in both the cyclosporine and emulsion groups.
    For nail breakage in the primary target nail on a four point scale of 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe. Nail breakage in the cyclosporine group was 1.55 at baseline compared with 0.91 at follow-up for a 0.64 improvement. Nail breakage in the emulsion group was 1.08 at baseline compared to 0.67 at follow-up in the emulsion nail for a 0.42 improvement. Cyclosporine improved nail breakage 0.22 points more than emulsion.
    For physician global assessment of improvement for the normal nail based on texture, luster, general appearance change from baseline on a five point scale of 1=Much Better, 2=Slightly Better, 3=No Change, 4=Slightly Worse, and 5=Much Worse. Physician global improvement assessment in the cyclosporine group was 2.36 and in the emulsion group was 2.92 at follow-up. Cyclosporine improved normal nails 0.55 points more than emulsion.
