Natural Cream with High Oil Phase 2W




 
 A Formulation to demonstrate the emulsifying capabilities of PolyAquol™-2W. A patent pending O/W polyglycerol self-emulsifier. This natural emulsifier is Ecocert and Cosmos approved. PolyAquol™-2W possesses a wide range of formulation compatibility while providing a unique skin feel to emulsions. On a more functional level, the emulsifier PolyAquol™-2W can generate highly organized liquid crystals important to provide stability to the emulsion and to ensure compatibility with the skin. Clinically, the natural emulsifier PolyAquol™-2W was shown to prevent and repair damage caused to the skin barrier function by UV exposure.
Formula #FEFE1833
