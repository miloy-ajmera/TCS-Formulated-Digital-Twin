Croda
Crodamol™ GTCC
Odor: blandUse: Fully saturated emollient triester, recommended as an alternative for mineral or vegetable oils in a wide variety of personal care and pharmaceutical applications. Fully saturated triglyceride. Light emollient with good lubricity. Excellent solvent for chemical sunscreens and wetting agent for physical sunscreens.
Croda
Crodasperse™
Odor: blandUse: Crodasperse is the latest innovation in delivery systems from Croda and is a unique blend of Crill 6, Crodamol GTCC and Cromollient DP3A. As the name implies, Crodasperse is a highly efficient dispersing agent for inorganic pigments such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and inorganic colour pigments. What is unique is the fact that Crodasperse allows the use of common low energy equipment to make the dispersions required for sun care products, colour cosmetics and other personal care applications.
Croda
MixXIN™ ME
Odor: blandUse: A cold process, cost efficient emulsification system that can be formulated into various formats from sprayable milks to rich creams. Generates white, glossy emulsions and allows for extremely high internal phase loadings of up to 80% polar oils. Works well in combination with OptaSense RMA-IS.
