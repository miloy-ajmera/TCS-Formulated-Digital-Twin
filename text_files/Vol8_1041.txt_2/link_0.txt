ABOUT
Prospector Lists



                        Lists combine the ease of Bookmarks with the versatility of Tags. Instead of one collection of bookmarked items, create as many collections, called "Lists," as you need.
                    
Previous Bookmarks and Tags




                                Find the link to your List page in the user menu.
                            

                            All Tags have been converted to separate Lists, and your bookmarked items have been saved to a "Bookmarks" List.




Adding Items

                        When you click the Add to List button, a dropdown of your existing Lists appears. Click the List name to which you want to add this product or formula.
                    



Create a New List

                        You can also create a new List. Simply click "Create a New List" and enter a name.
                    



Multiple Lists

                        When you define a new List, the current item is automatically added to it. You can add a product or formula to as many Lists as you need.



Explore Your Lists

                        Easily see which Lists this item appears in, and quickly go to that List from the links that appear on the page.
