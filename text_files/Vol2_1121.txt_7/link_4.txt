Product Description

Therapists’ trusted choice for over 30 years. Dual Purpose Massage Creme provides a superior combination of the workability of oil and the absorbency of a lotion.  This ideal lubricant meets the texture requirements for a variety of massage modalities ranging from high glide circulatory to slow deep tissue techniques.  Extra rich consistency will not spill on carpets and washes out easily from linens and clothing. The botanical qualities of Arnica Extract and Ivy Extract are the first choice for relief and provide added skin health and wellness benefits. Leaves skin soft and smooth without any residue.
