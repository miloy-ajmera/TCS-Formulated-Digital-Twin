            Leading Ingredients
          
        
SWISS APPLE STEM CELL EXTRACT: Plant-derived technology loved for it’s age-defying properties and it’s ability to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles


SQUALANE: Derived from sugarcane, it mimics body's natural hydrating oils to provide weightless moisture to deliver active ingredients deep into the skin and prevent overdrying.
Eyeseryl & Argireline: Reduces the look of dark circles and puffiness






All Ingredients:
Water/Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Squalane, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Panthenol, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-5, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Tocopherol, Pentylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lycium Barbarum (Goji) Fruit Extract, Lycopene, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Skin Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caffeine, Acacia Senegal Gum, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Ethyl Lauroyl Arginate HCL, Lecithin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Silica, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol *Organic






1Why does Squalane + Peptide Eye Gel contain Phenoxyethanol?

All of our products are thoroughly tested for safety. Further, our products are EWG verified. EWG allows for phenoxyethanol usage at certain levels. Phenoxyethanol has been regarded as a safe ingredient when used within certain parameters. We use phenoxyethanol because it helps to protect the product and the end user from the negative impacts of microbial growth in a personal care product (far more dangerous than any cosmetic ingredient).



2When I opened the Eye Gel bottle and found that there is no tube connecting to the pump. Is it broken?

The Peptide Eye Gel comes in an airless pump, each time you pump the product, it expels air and creates a vacuum internally that moves the plate with the product up to the pump.
 that doesn't require a straw to dispense the product. The non-pressurized airless chamber technology that excludes dip tubes prevents air exposure, which helps protect and conceal the formulas increasing shelf life. It also helps with dosage, it is exact the same with every pump, you will get every drop of product due to the rising piston.
