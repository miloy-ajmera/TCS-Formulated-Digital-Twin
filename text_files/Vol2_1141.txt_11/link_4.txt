About the health products advertising complaints table
This table does not include complaints that were received by Health Canada but that were referred to an Advertising Preclearance Agency (APA) for complaint adjudication as per the Guidance Document - Health Canada and Advertising Preclearance Agencies' Roles Related to Health Product Advertising. Complaints that are referred to the APAs are subject to their complaint adjudication process. Between October 1, 2014 and March 31, 2019, 66 complaints were referred to APAs. The scope of this table is currently limited to complaints related to the following types of health products: pharmaceuticals, biologics (including vaccines), medical devices, and natural health products.
This table lists Health Canada's compliance and enforcement activities as a result of complaints received by Health Canada. References to the product advertising listed above are not examples of violation of the legislation and regulations as determined by a court of law. For questions on the complaints in the Summary Table, please contact the Inspectorate at DCVIU_UVCEM@hc-sc.gc.ca.
When addressing advertising complaints, Health Canada's first priority is protecting the health and safety of Canadians. Health Canada's approach to addressing and resolving complaints uses the most appropriate level of intervention proportional to the health risk.
Health Canada assesses all of the complaints it receives to confirm whether or not the advertising materials comply with the applicable legislation and regulations, and takes appropriate action to address complaints where non-compliance is found.
Responsibilities Related to Health Product Advertising
Health Canada is the national regulatory authority for health product advertisements. The Department oversees and enforces the regulatory requirements related to health product advertising.
The Department plays an active role in addressing health product advertising complaints. It also works to prevent non-compliant advertising before it occurs, by developing policies and guidance, providing regulatory and policy clarifications and through stakeholder awareness activities. As well, Canada has a system in place that allows industry to have their advertising material reviewed and pre-cleared by independent APAs. While this system is voluntary, Health Canada strongly recommends that industry have their health product advertising material reviewed by an APA before dissemination, to help ensure it is compliant with legislative and regulatory requirements.
APAs also offer a mechanism to resolve certain advertising complaints. Health Canada assesses every complaint it receives, including the level of health risk they may pose, to determine next steps including whether the complaint should be addressed by Health Canada or referred to an APA. More information on the roles of Health Canada and the APAs is in the Guidance Document - Health Canada and Advertising Preclearance Agencies' Roles Related to Health Product Advertising.
Risk-Based Compliance and Enforcement Approach
All complaints are treated with the same vigilance, whether Health Canada identifies a potential advertising issue itself, receives a complaint directly or is referred a complaint from an APA. Each complaint is assessed to confirm whether the advertisement complies with legislative and regulatory requirements, and to determine the potential health risk posed. Health Canada prioritizes and takes action to address complaints based on whether they pose a potential health risk and the degree of that risk.
Health Canada takes a stepwise approach and will escalate measures if and as needed. In most cases, compliance is successfully achieved using a cooperative approach. This involves Health Canada informing the party of their non-compliance, usually through a compliance letter. The letter may request corrective action or discontinuation of the advertisement.
In general, for advertising activities considered to pose a low health risk to Canadians, the company is informed of the non-compliance and asked to take the appropriate corrective measures. In cases where the health risk is higher, Health Canada follows up as needed to verify that the requested action has been completed to Health Canada's satisfaction.
Health Canada may consider stronger action for advertising activities determined to pose a high health risk. These actions could include seizing the non-compliant advertising materials, site visits, issuing a public communication, or initiating enforcement proceedings (e.g., seeking an injunction or fines where a court order has been breached), to minimize the potential health risk to Canadians.
For complaints that involve the advertising of an unauthorized health product, Health Canada takes action to confirm that the company stops both the advertising and sale of the non-compliant health product in Canada, as the sale of unauthorized health products is not permitted in Canada.
More information on Health Canada's compliance and enforcement approach is available in the Inspectorate's Compliance and Enforcement Policy (POL-0001).
