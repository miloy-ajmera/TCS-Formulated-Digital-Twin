Refresh PM
Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 13, 2023Style: Refresh P.M. Lubricant Eye OintmentVerified Purchase
I have Bell's Palsy which effects the left side of my face. I can not close or blink my left eye. For several months, while recovering from an illness, I slept with that eye open without realizing what was happening. My eye became severely dry and I could hardly see anything with it. When I was finally able to see him, my eye doc had me putting Refresh PM in nightly and sleeping with a very snug sleep mask to protect the eye. I have been doing this for a little over a year now. Refresh PM definitely helps with night time dryness and helps to protect your eyes. I have to use it during the day, occasionally. It's a must have in my life!

Soothes severe dry eyes
Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 25, 2023Style: Refresh P.M. Lubricant Eye OintmentVerified Purchase
This product was recommended to me by my eye specialist for severe night dryness to be used just as I'm getting ready to go to sleep because it does blur your vision as it immediately begins to soothe the eye for nighttime sleeping. I use other drops for daytime dryness, but this ointment is the best for my nighttime dryness.

Relaxes your eyes
Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 20, 2023Style: Refresh P.M. Lubricant Eye OintmentVerified Purchase
It’s is one of the most satisfactory eye ointment I have ever used. This not only relaxes your eyes but gives you a relaxed and easy time to sleep and recover from eye fatigue.

Works pretty well
Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 10, 2023Style: Refresh P.M. Lubricant Eye OintmentVerified Purchase
This works well for dry winter nights when despite sleeping some air still circulates beneath closed lids and I wake up with dry itchy eyes. I am not a fan of the packaging however - the flexible tube makes it hard to dispense a small droplet without it sucking back in when you release pressure. I end up having to squeeze out way more, or wiping the tip on the rim of eye. I much prefer the similar formula from Genteal that comes in a metal tube.

Does a good job on moisturizing eyes dried out by sleep machine. Still they are dry by morning.

A little difficult to keep it in your eye. Moisturizes eyes but sleep machine can still dry them out by morning.
