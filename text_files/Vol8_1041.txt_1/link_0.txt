Crodafos CES constitutes an entirely new emulsifying and conditioning system for Personal Care and represents an exciting innovation in phosphate chemistry from Croda. Crodafos CES possesses unique emulsifying properties that allow it to form emulsions that display markedly different characteristics than those of conventional emulsifying waxes. These emulsions exhibit a combination of natural substantivity, greater oil deposition, and shear thinning (thixotrophy) to promote fast simultaneous release of oil and water-based actives from emulsions.

Croda considers the RSPO’s Mass Balance system to be an important progressive step in supporting the palm oil physical supply chain and creating momentum towards segregated sustainable Palm Oil and Palm Kernel Oil material. To that end, sampling will be of the sustainable palm variant, SP Crodafos CES MBAL.
