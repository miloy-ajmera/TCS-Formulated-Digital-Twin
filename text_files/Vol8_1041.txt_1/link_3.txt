Crodafos™ CES is a new phosphate-based emulsifying and conditioning wax conferring excellent functionality to personal care systems. As a finely-balanced complex blend of fatty alcohol and phosphate esters, Crodafos™ CES consitutes a synergistic emulsifying and conditioning system, offering formulating advantages over more conventional phosphate-based emulsifiers. Through a combination of its distinct chemical nature, surface activity and the rheological properties of the finished emulsion, this grade is highly recommended for both skin and hair care products.

Prospector Lists



                        Lists combine the ease of Bookmarks with the versatility of Tags. Instead of one collection of bookmarked items, create as many collections, called "Lists," as you need.
                    
Previous Bookmarks and Tags




                                Find the link to your List page in the user menu.
                            

                            All Tags have been converted to separate Lists, and your bookmarked items have been saved to a "Bookmarks" List.




Adding Items

                        When you click the Add to List button, a dropdown of your existing Lists appears. Click the List name to which you want to add this product or formula.
                    



Create a New List

                        You can also create a new List. Simply click "Create a New List" and enter a name.
                    



Multiple Lists
