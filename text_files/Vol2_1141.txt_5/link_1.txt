We all need a little more water in our lives. Whether it’s going to the ocean more, drinking more water, or hydrating our skin and hair with the purity of water, we just can’t seem to get enough of it!  There are, in fact, different types of water. Some that are great for your natural skin care products, and others that aren’t so great. There’s salt water, deionized water, purified water, reverse osmosis water, filtered water, tap water, and the list goes on.

What is the Role of Purified or Deionized Water in Natural Skin Care



We all need a little more water in our lives. Whether it’s going to the ocean more, drinking more water, or hydrating our skin and hair with the purity of water, we just can’t seem to get enough of it!

There are, in fact, different types of water. Some that are great for your natural skin care products, and others that aren’t so great. There’s salt water, deionized water, purified water, reverse osmosis water, filtered water, tap water, and the list goes on. 

Water is one of the best ingredients for hydrating the body, but also for hydrating the skin, hair and nails. But there are some types of water that can have harmful effects when mixed with other ingredients. That’s why when you read your labels, you’ll find most of the time, in quality products, the water they are using is purified water or deionized water. 

But what does those terms mean and why is it beneficial for skincare?

What is deionized water and what is its role in skincare?
Deionized water can also appear as demineralized water on your skincare products. But what is its role exactly? Water is usually used as a solvent or spreading agent in skincare products, because it wont rack up the price of the product and it’ll effectively hydrate the skin or hair as soon as you apply the product. Water also forms emulsions, which helps the oils and waters in a cream or lotion combine. Deionized or demineralized water, is water that has gone through a chemical filtration system to purify the water. It removes ion minerals like calcium, iron, sodium, copper, chloride and a few other minerals. 

We know that normally you would think that the minerals mentioned above would be great for your skin, since they seem to be great when they’re found in your food. But these ions can become harmful when they interact with other ingredients, especially with surfactants. Surfactants reduce surface tension which increases its spreading properties. It can act as a foaming agent, and as an emulsifying agent. In the beauty industry we know it for its foaming characteristic. 

What is purified water?
Purified water is similar to deionized water, except the filtration process is slightly different. Both deionized water and purified water are in beauty care products because the water is pure and won't interfere with the other ingredients. Furthermore, purified and deionized water won't contain traces of bacteria. And if they do, they are at a minimum and are approved by the European or American pharmacopoeias. 

Final thoughts on purified and deionized water in skin care products
Purified and deionized water is water that doesn't contain any toxins, pollutants or microbes in the water. So the next time your looking through Vonetta Cosmetics' product list and notice deionized water or purified water as the first ingredient in say, Chamomile Cream Cleanser, Balancing Moisturizer, Gentle Cleansing Gel
Pore Purifying Toner, and honestly the list does go on, you’ll know what it’s doing there! 

And when you go shopping for your other beauty products, now you’ll know why you should only look for products with deionized, demineralized or with purified water and not water or… aqua! Don’t be alarmed when you start noticing it in lotions, creams, conditioners, make up, deodorant, shaving products, sunscreen and more. 

Have any questions about the ingredients in your products? Reach out to us, we’d love to help in anyway we can!
