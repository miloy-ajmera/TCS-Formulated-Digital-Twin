**Pattern may be oriented sideways as shown in photo #3 for covers made to fit 12x18, 12x20, 12x24 and 14x20 inserts.**

► ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE TAKEN ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE COVER (WHERE ARROWS POINT IN DIAGRAM ABOVE).
► Size options are listed with the recommended insert size, followed by the finished cover size in (brackets).
► For example: If you are using a 18x18 insert, order "Fits 18x18 insert (17x17 cover)" and we will make your pillow cover to fit appropriately. 
► If you have an old cover that fits your insert well, measure your old cover and compare its dimensions to the size chart below to find the closest size. The size chart is designed for knife-edge inserts only (inserts without a gusset). Contact us if you require assistance.

► Don't see your size listed above? Request a custom size.




► The posted measurements are taken at the interior midpoints with the cover inside out. 
► All covers are slightly contoured in shape and made with tapered corners for a professional appearance (no droopy corners!).  For this reason, stated cover measurements are taken across the middle (not from corner to corner).

► Finished cover sizes are made smaller to best fit based on the insert size and fabric weight. For further explanation, please see this FAQ. The standard size chart is developed from actual testing on both feather and polyfil inserts commercially made and available on the market. The sizing is designed for your insert to fill out the cover completely for a full, plump appearance after stuffing in the manner shown in our shop’s product photos and like pillows in interior design and architecture magazines. The finished pillow should have a nice, defined outline yet be comfortable to sit upon. 
► Please allow for +/- 3% tolerance on measurements. Minor variances do not affect the fit. Our pillow covers are human-made and measurements may not be exact down to the millimeter.
► For additional help, please review our Frequently Asked Questions and Sizing Guide.
