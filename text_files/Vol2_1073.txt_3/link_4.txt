                        I love all the Epionce products. They are extremely hydrating and moisturizing. My favorite is Medical Barrier Cream. It’s my go-to moisturizer.

                        The Medical Barrier Cream is also a favorite of mine. I use this with all dermaplaning and peel services. It is also useful for bites, burns and skin irritations.
