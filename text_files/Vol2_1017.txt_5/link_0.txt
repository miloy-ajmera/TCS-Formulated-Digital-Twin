SOFTISAN 378 is a specialty blend of triglycerides based on saturated even-numbered, unbranched natural fatty acids of vegetable origin with a chain length of C8 – C18. It is free from antioxidants and other stabilizing additives.
SOFTISAN 378 is a Hard fat with softer consistency, similar to natural lard, but stable, odorless, emollient in creams, capsule filling mass.
WITEPSOL and SOFTISAN 378 are used in pharmaceutical dosage forms such as

Chewable tablets, e.g. antacid formulations
Creams, e.g. formulations containing corticosteroids
Soft gel capsules, e.g. vitamin capsules, anti-cancer formulations

Recommended for formulation that requires a more solid but still soft API-carrier. Blend of triglycerides, product meets the requirements of the current Ph. Eur. and USP-NF monographs “Hard Fat”.
Hydroxyl Value (mg KOH/g): 7-17
Melting Point (°C): ~38
SOFTISAN 378 is used as a non-oxidizing fat base in the pharmaceutical industries. It is particularly suitable for processing in high-quality dermal preparations because the skin is provided with a similar triglyceride mixture that is not tacky and, unlike paraffins, does not leave a greasy shine. SOFTISAN  allows for rapid melting of the product on the skin, and incorporated active ingredients are therefore quickly released. In addition, it has absorption promoting properties and behaves in a neutral manner towards active substances. SOFTISAN 378 is also suitable as a carrier of active ingredients in hard and soft gelatin capsules. It can be easily incorporated, either in molten or cold state, in ointments, creams, lotions and pastes. Owing to its purely vegetable origin and its mode of production, SOFTISAN 378 is free of any skin-irritating substances such as toxic heavy metals, catalysts, solvents, antioxidants and other stabilizers.
