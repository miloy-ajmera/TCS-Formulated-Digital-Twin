Shea butter to Softisan 378 ratio

My Shea butter based balm becomes grainy in summer. To prevent this from happening, I am considering Softisan 378. Let‚Äôs say, the formulation contains 100g of Shea butter. How much Softisan 378 would I need to offer oxidative stability to Shea butter. Thanks in advance üôÇ

If your balm becomes grainy, it has nothing to do with oxidation. Softisan 378 doesn‚Äôt protect anything from oxidation, anyway.
Store your balm at a cooler place or rework its composition. To prevent it from oxidising, add an antioxidant.

@Pharma Let me rephrase my question/problem. What can I do to prevent shea butter from going grainy when the finished product softens and solidifies in summer? I have reformulated the recipe with different amounts of shea butter and even at the lowest quantity, it gets grainy.¬†

Not possible. ‚ÄúSoftens and solidifies in summer.‚Äù Stop it doing that and you‚Äôll be OK.

Reformulate so it doesn‚Äôt get too soft, make a cream instead of a balm, or buy an A/C  .
Allegedly, mango butter instead of shea butter helps too because mango butter is said to not ‚Äògrain‚Äô.

@Belassi Thank you. It makes sense.¬† I will reduce shea butter and increase the wax and see how it turns out.
Please check this link¬†https://www.formulatorsampleshop.com/Softisan-378-p/fssb30044.htm
It says ‚Äúprevents graininess with butters‚Äù. What‚Äôs your take on that?

@Pharma It remains soft and creamy at home . The moment I take it on a trip in summer, things stop being rosy. I tried mango butter and it went grainy as well. I will reformate and prevent it from melting.¬†

Or cool it fast once you come back from your trip in the sun. It requires slow cooling for grains to form and simply placing your tube/pot in the freezer might do the trick for your personal pleasure (not so much for customers, should you sell your balm).

Although softisan is a nice material it alone won‚Äôt stop a balm from getting ¬†grainy. It‚Äôs much more complex than adding just one ingredient. You probably have too much of shea butter. And it has nothing to do with summer.¬†

@ngarayeva001 I use 6.5g shea, 5.6g castor wax, 10.6g almond oil, 2.9g zinc oxide and 2.9g of arrowroot. The total weight is 28.5g. Should I reduce Shea butter to half or quarter of what I use at present?

In this case, it‚Äôs zinc oxide clustering, not even shea butter. What is the purpose of this product?

@ngarayeva001, I tried it without the zinc oxide and it still went grainy. The purpose of this product is to ease diaper rash.

In that case use about 25% aloe vera.

In this case, cut shea butter to 15% max and add 5% of softisan. There‚Äôs no advised ratio but it might be a good starting point.

@Belassi, anything else as a substitute besides aloe vera? The product has to remain vegan and free of coconut and its derivatives.

@ngarayeva001, 15% of the whole recipe should be shea butter right?
