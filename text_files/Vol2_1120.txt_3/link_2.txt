MIGLYOL® Coco 810

Technical Datasheet
|

Supplied by IOI Oleo







Coco-Caprylate/Caprate. MIGLYOL® Coco 810 by IOI Oleo acts as an emollient and refatting agent. It is 100% natural ingredient and has non-polar character. It can be considered a true vegetable alterna­tive for light petrochemical based emollients like IPM, mineral oils or silicones (e.g. D5). Due to its extremely light skin feel and fast spreading, it provides dry, non-oily skin feel and low-medium pigment dispersion. It is non-oxidisable and odorless. It creates an elegant, silky smoothing film on the skin that will not dominate over the medium spreading oils in the formulation. It decreases heavy and greasy skin feel of slow spreading oils and will benefit the formulation with a long-lasting care effect. Used in face care, baby care, massage oil, hand cream, lip products and natural cosmetics. MIGLYOL® Coco 810 is ECOCERT and RSPO MB certified.
