            Flavors & Fragrances
        

Our fragrances are components of the highest quality available and are produced and designed especially for personal care and cosmetic products. Most fragrances are a blend of natural components and specific aroma compounds which make it possible at all to create stable fragrances and scents. All fragrances can be used in practically all personal care products. All our flavors have GRAS status (generally recognized as safe) and are either extracts from natural sources or created artificially as complex mixtures of individual naturally occurring flavor compounds combined together to either imitate or enhance a natural flavor.
