<strong>Product</strong> <strong>Information</strong> 27.06.05 <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> ® <strong>649</strong> <strong>Ointment</strong> <strong>Base</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Lanolin</strong> Substitute 1. Description <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> <strong>649</strong> is a partial ester of diglycerin with medium chain fatty acids, isostearic acid, stearic acid, 12-hydroxystearic acid <strong>and</strong> adipic acid. The assigned CAS-no. is 130905-60-1. 2. INCI/CTFA name Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2 3. JCIC ** name Diglyceryl Adipate Mixed Fatty Acid Ester Characteristic values Tests Value Unit Method Acid value max. 2 mg KOH/g Ph.Eur. * 2.5.1 Saponification value 270 – 290 mg KOH/g DGF * C-V3 Iodine value max. 3 g I 2 /100 g DGF C-V 11b Hydroxyl value 55 – 85 mg KOH/g DGF C-V 17a Iodine color value max. 10 mg I 2 /100 ml DGF C-IV 4a Water max. 0.25 % DGF C-III 13a Total ash max. 0.15 % DGF C-III 10 Drop point 32.0 – 37.0 °C AOCS * Cc1880 4. Characteristics <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> <strong>649</strong> is a yellowish, pasty, tacky, very stringy substance which melts to clearity at about 40 °C. It has a typically fatty odor <strong>and</strong> a neutral taste. <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> <strong>649</strong> is soluble in diethylether, hexane, benzine <strong>and</strong> hot ethanol. Its waterabsorption capacity is at least 170 % (according to Ph.Eur. “Adeps lanae”). <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> <strong>649</strong> is miscible with fats, oils <strong>and</strong> paraffin hydrocarbons, <strong>and</strong> as such is very compatible with consistency regulators such as cetyl alcohol, stearic acid, beeswax, petrolatum or triglycerides. <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> <strong>649</strong> has a viscosity similar to that of natural lanolin at temperatures from 25 °C to 70 °C. However, unlike lanolin, <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> <strong>649</strong> undergoes no changes in viscosity caused by factors such as temperature, light <strong>and</strong> time. <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> <strong>649</strong> is stable in color <strong>and</strong> maintains its neutral odor even at high temperatures. <strong>SOFTISAN</strong> <strong>649</strong> can be sterilized by heat.
