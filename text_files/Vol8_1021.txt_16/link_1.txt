A partially neutralized ester of mono- and diglycerides of unsaturated edible fatty acids with citric acid and lactic acid for soft creams and lotions, providing a long lasting rich, but non sticky skin feel


Glyceryl citrate / lactate / linoleate / Oleate
Glyceryl citrate / lactate / linoleate / Oleate is a liquid food-approved O/W emulsifier suitable for soft creams and lotion.
In emulsion Glyceryl citrate / lactate / linoleate / Oleate improves skin feel and provides a long lasting, rich but non-sticky skin feeling. The production is not limited to hot/hot process, as it is a liquid product it can be used in hot/cold; cold/cold or pre-emulsion production processes. 
As Glyceryl citrate / lactate / linoleate / Oleate is oil soluble it can be used in self-emulsifying bath or skin oils and is compatible with skin and mucosa.
Glyceryl citrate / lactate / linoleate / Oleate is readily soluble in acetone, medium chain triglycerides and fatty oils, slightly soluble in ethanol. Glyceryl citrate / lactate / linoleate / Oleate is easily dispersable in water. 
Characteristics
Glyceryl citrate / lactate / linoleate / Oleate is a yellowish liquid of viscous consistency, similar to honey, having a typical odor and a neutral taste
