As you transition your skin-care routine from summer to autumn, we have some newness to consider adding to your product lineup. Peach & Lily has a thicker moisturizer to consider. Three Ships and Nuebiome just dropped exfoliating masks for sloughing away fall flakiness. Noble Panacea, on the other hand, has a new brightening serum for keeping your complexion glowing even on sweater weather days. If you need something to inspire your next vacation or bring back memories of your last, this month's skin-care launches include a moisturizer made with bioactive water from a certain spa in Iceland, a facial cleanser with South Korean roots, and a line-smoothing emulsion straight from France. For your body care lineup, perhaps a body oil that pays homage to fragrant trees in Japan, and a banana pudding-scented body scrub made in collaboration with a famous New York City bakery will complement your wanderlust. You can find all these products teased above — and many, many more from the likes of Wishful, SkinCeuticals, and Maya Chia — are revealed below in this handy list of the best September skin-care launches. All products featured on Allure are independently selected by our editors.

The Bioré Blemish Patches act as a protective covering and healing spot treatment for zits with its ultra-thin hydrocolloid material. Pinterest2/19Peace Out Instant Pore Perfector Shop Now$28This adorable teal tube is filled with a pore-blurring filter for your skin-care routine. The Peace Out Instant Pore Perfector is spiked with skin-smoothing malic acid and nourishing niacinamide to help clear pores while decreasing their appearance. Try it out as a makeup primer too for a texture-free canvas. Pinterest3/19Wishful Pillowgasm Cherry Glow Sleep MaskShop Now$39Wishful Pillowgasm Cherry Glow Sleep Mask gives slugging your skin a fruity spin. Instead of reaching for Vaseline to seal in your nighttime skin-care routine, consider this antioxidant-rich cherry extract-forward formula that helps lock in all the moisture and smoothing goodness of everything you layered onto your skin while giving it a brightening boost. Pinterest4/19Skin Proud Proud Pods 100% SqualaneShop Now$16Squalane, for those unfamiliar, is an emollient-rich ingredient that can "aid in skin-care problems wherein the skin barrier is disrupted and transepidermal water loss is an issue," Dr. Fisher previously shared with Allure. No matter what your skin type may be, you can take advantage of its moisture-locking benefits with the Skin Proud Proud Pods 100% Squalane. The cute serum-filled capsules are filled with straight squalane, so you can easily slather on the freshest, most concentrated form of the popular, effective ingredient. Pinterest5/19L'Occitane Immortelle Precious Enriched EmulsionShop Now$80The L'Occitane Immortelle Precious Enriched Emulsion is an incredible product for taking your skin-care routine from summer to fall.

You can slather it on as a lightweight lotion to help plump and hydrate skin or put it on before your favorite face cream to increase the amount of moisture in your regimen. No matter how you implement it, a medley of floral-based oils and hyaluronic acid will help make things happen. More from Allure21 Best Body Lotions for Super-Smooth SkinThe 17 Best Cleansing Balms to Melt Away Stubborn MakeupThe Perfect Nighttime Routine Is Inside the April Allure Beauty Box25 Best Eye Creams to Nourish Tired UndereyesPinterest6/19Peach & Lily Peptide Pro Firming MoisturizerShop Now$43After washing your face with the K-beauty brand's Best of Beauty-winning Ginger Melt Oil Cleanser, you can reach for the Peach & Lily Peptide Pro Firming Moisturizer.

That extra step can be tedious at times, so it brought the benefits of both steps into one product: the Slurp Labs Gel Cleanser. The blue Powerade-colored face wash simultaneously rinses away both water- and oil-based impurities with the help of six different gentle, non-stripping surfactants. It also helps unclog pores with absorbent French Auvergne clay and malachite extract. Pinterest16/19Tatcha Forest Awakening Cedar & Hinoki Body MilkShop Now$48TatchaTatcha has finally entered the body care game, and its multi-faceted lineup smells better than we could ever imagine. The beloved Japanese skin-care brand worked with Qing Li, MD, an expert in forest medicine, to help it bring the best of Japanese bathing culture to the new products, including the Tatcha Forest Awakening Cedar & Hinoki Body Milk. Hinoki, for those unfamiliar,  is an evergreen tree, meaning it stays green for many seasons, producing high levels of essential oils throughout the year. "I've studied multiple types of trees' essential oils, and Hinoki has proven to be the most beneficial of forest oils in terms of mental and physical benefits," Li told Allure. In other words, the hinoki-fied body milk helps calms both skin and spirit as soon as you rub it into you skin. Most PopularSkin25 Best Eye Creams to Nourish Tired UndereyesBy Marci RobinSkin24 Best Face Serums to Target Any and All Skin-Care ConcernsBy Karina HoshikawaSkin21 Best Body Lotions for Super-Smooth SkinBy Sarah HanPinterest17/19Rael 3-Step Pore Melting PackShop Now$8I'm finally watching The O.C. for the first time, and my favorite companion on this inner teen healing journey has been the new Rael 3-Step Pore Melting Pack.

My nose has never been happier and neither have I. Pinterest18/19HoliFrog Moonbeam Retinol Treatment SerumShop Now$68I've gone through no less than five bottles of HoliFrog's Sunnyside C Glow Serum, and I'm about to be doing the same with the new HoliFrog Moonbeam Retinol Treatment Serum.
