        Calendula :
        Calendula officinalis 'Bronzed Beauty' "Pot Marigold"

      Calendula officinalis ‘Bronzed Beauty’           Oh my! Is this not THE prettiest Calendula you’ve ever seen with its peachy-cream petals, bronze-ruby undersides and delicious dark eye? Bountifully blooms from Spring to Fall, especially if you cut it back when it gets leggy. Often overwinters for us lucky coastal folks! But hey, it self-sows readily anyway, so you’ll always have fresh (and free) new plants each year! I think I must partner it with ruby-leaved Heuchera ’Melting Fire’ this Spring. Clay tolerant but best in rich soil. Nice in containers. Edible and medicinal. Deer resistant! To 18” high and wide.
