Why is DailyMed no longer displaying pill images on the Search Results and Drug Info pages?


                Due to inconsistencies between the drug labels on DailyMed and the pill images provided by RxImage, we no longer display the RxImage pill images associated with drug labels.
            

                We anticipate reposting the images once we are able identify and filter out images that do not match the information provided in the drug labels.
