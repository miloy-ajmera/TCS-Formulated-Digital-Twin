The Hydrafacial™ x JLo Beauty Booster was inspired by the iconic “JLo Glow” and the results of the JLo Beauty hero product – That JLo Glow Serum – which is clinically tested to improve skin radiance, smoothness and hydration. The Hydrafacial™ x JLo Beauty Booster features a unique combination of potent ingredients including a tri-fermented essence, super antioxidants and niacinamide which will leave skin plump, healthy-looking and glowing like never before.

FAQ



What is HydraFacial?


HydraFacial is an invigorating treatment that can be given in as little as 30 minutes. It delivers long-term skin health and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of all skin types. It offers instant, noticeable results with no downtime or irritation. The HydraFacial treatment removes dead skin cells and extracts impurities while simultaneously bathing the new skin with cleansing, hydrating and moisturizing serums. The treatment is soothing, refreshing, non-irritating and immediately effective.


Why is HydraFacial good for my skin?


Hydration is the foundation of healthy, radiant skin. Irritation of the skin has been proven to increase signs of aging. HydraFacial is a hydrating and non-irritating treatment.


Am I a candidate for this treatment?


The HydraFacial treatment is designed for all skin types. Even the most sensitive skin easily tolerates the HydraFacial treatment. Your physician or skincare professional may choose specific treatment serums and/or customize the treatment for your unique skin conditions and needs. Consult your physician or skincare professional for a skin evaluation and sensitivity test.


How long does the treatment take? Is there any downtime or pain involved?


Our goal is to help support you in a balanced lifestyle. That’s why HydraFacial is a fast, efficient treatment that takes as little as 30 minutes. You may put on makeup and return to your normal activities right after the treatment since there is no downtime.


What results may be expected? How many treatments are needed to see results? How long do the results last?


Many clients report seeing visible skin refinement and an even, radiant skin tone after just one treatment. The smooth results and hydration may last 5 to 7 days or even longer. We don’t believe in quick fixes, so one treatment per month is recommended for improving the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, brown spots, oily and congested skin. Continued HydraFacial treatments are highly recommended to maintain skin health results.
