1 Authorized CRC, BTC, CTC or TC specification cylinders that correspond with a DOT specification cylinder are listed in § 171.12(a)(4)(iii) of this subchapter. 
2 Use of existing cylinders is authorized. New construction is not authorized.

 

(2) A cylinder must be filled in accordance with this part, except that a “TC” cylinder must be filled in accordance with the Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Before each filling of a cylinder, the person filling the cylinder must visually inspect the outside of the cylinder. A cylinder that has a crack or leak, is bulged, has a defective valve or a leaking or defective pressure relief device, or bears evidence of physical abuse, fire or heat damage, or detrimental rusting or corrosion, may not be filled and offered for transportation. A cylinder may be repaired and requalified only as prescribed in subpart C of part 180 of this subchapter.  

(3) Pressure relief devices must be tested for leaks before a filled cylinder is shipped from the cylinder filling plant. It is expressly forbidden to repair a leaking fusible plug device where the leak is through the fusible metal or between the fusible metal and the opening in the plug body, except by removal and replacement of the pressure relief device.  

(4) A cylinder that previously contained a Class 8 material must be requalified in accordance with § 180.205(e) of this subchapter.  

(5) When a cylinder with a marked pressure limit is prescribed, another cylinder made under the same specification but with a higher marked pressure limit is authorized. For example, a cylinder marked “DOT-4B500” may be used when “DOT-4B300” is specified.  

(6) No person may fill a cylinder overdue for periodic requalification with a hazardous material and then offer it for transportation. The prohibition against offering a cylinder for transportation that is overdue for periodic requalification does not apply to a cylinder filled prior to the requalification due date.  

(7) A cylinder with an authorized service life may not be offered for transportation in commerce after its authorized service life has expired. However, a cylinder in transportation or a cylinder filled prior to the expiration of its authorized service life may be transported for reprocessing or disposal of the cylinder's contents. After emptying, the cylinder must be condemned in accordance with § 180.205 of this subchapter.  

(8) The pressure of the hazardous material at 55 °C (131 °F) may not exceed 5⁄4 of the service pressure of the cylinder. Sufficient outage must be provided so the cylinder will not be liquid full at 55 °C (131 °F).  

(9) Specification 2P, 2Q, 3E, 3HT, spherical 4BA, 4D, 4DA, 4DS, and 39 cylinders must be packed in strong non-bulk outer packagings. The outside of the combination packaging must be marked with an indication that the inner packagings conform to the prescribed specifications.  

(10) Any person who installs a valve into an aluminum cylinder in oxygen service must verify the valve and the cylinder have the same thread type.  

(11) Cylinder valves manufactured on or after November 7, 2019, used on cylinders to transport compressed gases must conform to the applicable requirements in CGA V–9 (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter). A valve for a UN pressure receptacle must conform to the requirements of § 173.301b(c)(1). Cylinder valves used on cylinders in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) service are permitted to comply with the requirements of NFPA 58 (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter).  

(12) Cylinder valve protection caps manufactured on or after November 7, 2019, must conform to the requirements of CGA V–9.  


(b) Cylinder markings.  Required markings on a cylinder must be legible and must meet the applicable requirements of subpart C of part 180 of this subchapter. Additional information may be marked on the cylinder provided it does not affect the required markings prescribed in the applicable cylinder specification.  

(c) Toxic gases and mixtures.  Cylinders containing toxic gases and toxic gas mixtures meeting the criteria of Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A or B must conform to the requirements of § 173.40 and CGA S–1.1 (compliance with paragraph 9.1.1 is not required) (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter) and CGA S–7 (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter). A DOT 39 cylinder, UN non-refillable cylinder, or a UN composite cylinder certified to ISO–11119–3 may not be used for a toxic gas or toxic gas mixture meeting the criteria for Division 2.3, Hazard Zone A or B.  

(d) Gases capable of combining chemically.  A filled cylinder may not contain any gas or material capable of combining chemically with the cylinder's contents or with the cylinder's material of construction, so as to endanger the cylinder's serviceability.  

(e) Ownership of cylinder.  A cylinder filled with a hazardous material may not be offered for transportation unless it was filled by the owner of the cylinder or with the owner's consent.  

(f) Pressure relief device systems. 

(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(5) through (f)(7) and (j) of this section, and § 171.23(a) of this subchapter, a cylinder filled with a gas and offered for transportation must be equipped with one or more pressure relief devices sized and selected as to type, location, and quantity, and tested in accordance with CGA S–1.1 (compliance with paragraph 9.1.1 is not required) and CGA Pamphlet S–7 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The pressure relief device must be capable of preventing rupture of the normally filled cylinder when subjected to a fire test conducted in accordance with CGA C–14 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or, in the case of an acetylene cylinder, CGA C–12 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).  

(2) A pressure relief device, when installed, must be in communication with the vapor space of a cylinder containing a Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material. This requirement does not apply to DOT Specification 39 cylinders of 1.2L (75 cubic inches) or less in volume filled with a Liquefied petroleum gas, Methyl acetylene and Propadiene mixtures, stabilized, Propylene, Propane or Butane.  

(3) For a specification 3, 3A, 3AA, 3AL, 3AX, 3AAX, 3B, 3BN, or 3T cylinder filled with gases in other than Division 2.2 (except oxygen and oxidizing gases transported by aircraft, see §§ 173.302(f) and 173.304(f)), the burst pressure of a CG–1, CG–4, or CG–5 pressure relief device must be at test pressure with a tolerance of plus zero to minus 10 percent. An additional 5 percent tolerance is allowed when a combined rupture disk is placed inside a holder. This requirement does not apply if a CG–2, CG–3, or CG–9 thermally activated relief device or a CG–7 reclosing pressure valve is used on the cylinder.  

(4) 

(i) A pressure relief device is required on a DOT 39 cylinder regardless of cylinder size or filled pressure.  

(ii) A DOT 39 cylinder used for liquefied Division 2.1 materials must be equipped with a metal pressure relief device.  

(iii) Fusible pressure relief devices are not authorized on a DOT 39 cylinder containing a liquefied gas.  

(iv) A pressure relief device for oxidizing gases transported by air in a DOT 39 cylinder must meet the requirements of § 173.302(f)(2)(iii) of this subpart for permanent gases and § 173.304(f)(2)(iii) for liquefied compressed gases.  


(5) A pressure relief device is not required on—  
(i) A cylinder 305 mm (12 inches) or less in length, exclusive of neck, and 114 mm (4.5 inches) or less in outside diameter, except when the cylinder is filled with a liquefied gas for which this part requires a service pressure of 1800 psig or higher or a nonliquefied gas to a pressure of 1800 psig or higher at 21 °C (70 °F);  

(ii) A cylinder with a water capacity of less than 454 kg (1000 lbs.) filled with a nonliquefied gas to a pressure of 300 psig or less at 21 °C (70 °F), except for a DOT 39 cylinder or a cylinder used for acetylene in solution;  

(iii) A cylinder containing a Class 3 or a Class 8 material without pressurization, unless otherwise specified for the hazardous material; or  

(iv) A UN pressure receptacle transported in accordance with paragraph (k) or (l) of this section.  


(6) A pressure relief device is prohibited on a cylinder filled with a Division 2.3 or 6.1 material in Hazard Zone A.  

(7) A pressure relief device is not required on a DOT Specification 3E cylinder measuring up to 50mm (2 inches) in diameter by 305mm (12 inches) in length for the following specified gases and maximum weight limits:  
(i) Carbon Dioxide 0.24L (8 oz.)  

(ii) Ethane 0.12L (4 oz.)  

(iii) Ethylene 0.12L (4 oz.)

(v) Monochlorotrifluoromethane 0.35L (12 oz.)  

(vi) Nitrous oxide, 0.24L (8 oz.)  

(vii) Vinyl fluoride, stabilized 0.24L (8 oz.)  



(g) Manifolding cylinders in transportation. 

(1) Cylinder manifolding is authorized only under conditions prescribed in this paragraph (g). Manifolded cylinders must be supported and held together as a unit by structurally adequate means. Except for Division 2.2 materials, each cylinder must be equipped with an individual shutoff valve that must be tightly closed while in transit. Manifold branch lines must be sufficiently flexible to prevent damage to the valves that otherwise might result from the use of rigid branch lines. Each cylinder must be individually equipped with a pressure relief device as required in paragraph (f) of this section, except that pressure relief devices on manifolded horizontal cylinders that are mounted on a motor vehicle or framework may be selected as to type, location, and quantity according to the lowest marked pressure limit of an individual cylinder in the manifolded unit. The pressure relief devices selected for the manifolded unit must have been tested in accordance with CGA S–1.1 and CGA S–7. Pressure relief devices on manifolded horizontal cylinders filled with a compressed gas must be arranged to discharge unobstructed to the open air. In addition, for Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material, the pressure relief devices (PRDs) must be arranged to discharge upward to prevent any escaping gas from contacting personnel or any adjacent cylinders. Valves and pressure relief devices on manifolded cylinders filled with a compressed gas must be protected from damage by framing, a cabinet or other method. Manifolding is authorized for cylinders containing the following gases:  
(i) Nonliquefied (permanent) compressed gases authorized by § 173.302.  

(ii) Liquefied compressed gases authorized by § 173.304. Each manifolded cylinder containing a liquefied compressed gas must be separately filled and means must be provided to ensure no interchange of cylinder contents can occur during transportation.  

(iii) Acetylene as authorized by § 173.303. Mobile acetylene trailers must be maintained, operated and transported in accordance with CGA G–1.6 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).  


(2) For the checking of tare weights or replacing solvent, the cylinder must be removed from the manifold. This requirement is not intended to prohibit filling acetylene cylinders while manifolded.  


(h) Cylinder valve protection.  UN pressure receptacles must meet the valve protection requirements in § 173.301b(c). A DOT specification cylinder used to transport a hazardous material must meet the requirements specified in this paragraph (h).  
(1) The following specification cylinders are not subject to the cylinder valve protection requirements in this paragraph (h):  
(i) A cylinder containing only a Division 2.2 material without a Division 5.1 subsidiary hazard;  

(ii) A cylinder containing a Class 8 liquid corrosive only to metal;  

(iii) A cylinder with a water capacity of 4.8 liters (293 in3) or less containing oxygen, compressed;  

(iv) A cylinder containing oxygen, refrigerated liquid (cryogenic liquid);  

(v) A Medical E cylinder with a water capacity of 4.9 liters (300 in3) or less;  

(vi) A fire extinguisher; or  

(vii) A “B” style cylinder with a capacity of 40 ft3 (1.13 m3) or an “MC” style cylinder with a capacity of 10 ft3 (0.28m3) containing acetylene.  


(2) For cylinders manufactured before October 1, 2007, a cylinder must have its valves protected by one of the following methods:  
(i) By equipping the cylinder with securely attached metal or plastic caps of sufficient strength to protect valves from damage during transportation;  

(ii) By boxing or crating the cylinders so as to protect valves from damage during transportation;  

(iii) By constructing the cylinder so that the valve is recessed into the cylinder or otherwise protected to the extent that it will not be subjected to a blow when the container is dropped onto a flat surface; or  

(iv) By loading the cylinders in an upright position and securely bracing the cylinders in rail cars or motor vehicles, when loaded by the consignor and unloaded by the consignee.  


(3) For cylinders manufactured on or after October 1, 2007, each cylinder valve assembly must be of sufficient strength or protected such that no leakage occurs when a cylinder with the valve installed is dropped 1.8 m (6 ft.) or more onto a non-yielding surface, such as concrete or steel, impacting the valve assembly or protection device at an orientation most likely to cause damage. The cylinder valve assembly protection may be provided by any method meeting the performance requirement in this paragraph (h)(3). Examples include:  
(i) Equipping the cylinder with a securely attached metal cap.  

(ii) Packaging the cylinder in a box, crate, or other strong outer packaging conforming to the requirements of § 173.25.  

(iii) Constructing the cylinder such that the valve is recessed into the cylinder or otherwise protected.  



(i) Cylinders mounted in motor vehicles or in frames. 

(1) MEGCs must conform to the requirements in § 173.312. DOT specification cylinders mounted on motor vehicles or in frames must conform to the requirements specified in this paragraph (i).  

(2) Seamless DOT specification cylinders longer than 2 m (6.5 feet) are authorized for transportation only when horizontally mounted on a motor vehicle or in an ISO framework or other framework of equivalent structural integrity in accordance with CGA TB–25 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The pressure relief device must be arranged to discharge unobstructed to the open air. In addition, for Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material, the pressure relief devices must be arranged to discharge upward to prevent any escaping gas from contacting personnel or any adjacent cylinders.  

(3) Cylinders may not be transported by rail in container on freight car (COFC) or trailer on flat car (TOFC) service except under conditions approved by the Associate Administrator for Safety, Federal Railroad Administration.  


(j) Non-specification cylinders in domestic use.  Except as provided in §§ 171.12(a) and 171.23(a) of this subchapter, a filled cylinder manufactured to other than a DOT specification or a UN standard in accordance with part 178 of this subchapter, or a DOT exemption or special permit cylinder or a cylinder used as a fire extinguisher in conformance with § 173.309(a), may not be transported to, from, or within the United States.  

(k) Metal attachments.  Metal attachments to cylinders must have rounded or chamfered corners, or be otherwise protected, so as to prevent the likelihood of causing puncture or damage to other hazardous materials packages. This requirement applies to anything temporarily or permanently attached to the cylinder, such as metal skids.

(2) Subject to § 173.301a(d), any filling density percentage prescribed in this section is authorized to be increased by a factor of 2 for liquefied petroleum gas in DOT 3 cylinders or in DOT 3A cylinders marked for 1800 psig, or higher, service pressure.  

(3) Liquefied petroleum gas must be shipped in specification cylinders as follows:  
(i) DOT 3, 3A, 3AA, 3B, 3E, 3AL, 4B, 4BA, 4B240ET, 4BW, 4E, or 39 cylinders. The internal volume of a Specification 39 cylinder must not exceed 75 cubic inches. Shipments of flammable gases in DOT 3AL cylinders are authorized only when transported by motor vehicle, rail car, or cargo-only aircraft.  

(ii) Additional containers may be used within the limits of quantity and pressure as follows:  


Type of container 
Maximum capacity (cubic inches) 
Maximum filling pressure (psig) 



DOT-2P or DOT-2Q (see Note 1)
31.83

DOT-2P or DOT-2Q (see Note 1)
31.83
35 psig at 70 °F and 100 psig at 130 °F. 




 Note 1: Containers must be packed in strong wooden or fiber boxes of such design as to protect valves from damage or accidental functioning under conditions normally incident to transportation. Each completed container filled for shipment must have been heated until its contents reach a temperature of 54 °C (130 °F), without evidence of leakage, distortion, or other defect. Each outside shipping container must be plainly marked “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH PRESCRIBED SPECIFICATIONS'. 
 Note 2: A container must be equipped with a pressure relief device that will prevent rupture of the container and dangerous projection of a closing device when exposed to fire.

 


(4) Verification of content.  A cylinder with a water capacity of 90.72 kg (200 lb) or more and for use with a liquefied petroleum gas with a specific gravity of 0.504 or greater at 16 °C (60 °F) may have the quantity of its contents determined by using a fixed length dip tube gauging device. The length of the dip tube must be such that when a liquefied petroleum gas, with a specific volume of 0.03051 cu. ft./lb. at a temperature of 40 °F, is filled into the container, the liquid just reaches the bottom of the tube. The weight of this liquid may not exceed 42 percent of the water capacity of the container, which must be stamped on the cylinder. The length of the dip tube, expressed in inches carried out to one decimal place and prefixed with the letters “DT”, must be stamped on the container and on the exterior of removable type dip tube. For the purpose of this requirement, the marked length must be expressed as the distance measured along the axis of a straight tube from the top of the boss through which the tube is inserted to the proper level of the liquid in the container. The length of each dip tube must be checked when installed by weighing each container after filling except when installed in groups of substantially identical containers, in which case one of each 25 containers must be weighed. The quantity of liquefied gas in each container must be checked by means of the dip tube after disconnecting from the filling line. The outlet from the dip tube may not be larger than 0.1016 centimeters (0.040 inch; No. 54 drill bit size orifice). A container representative of each day's filling at each filling plant must have its contents checked by weighing after disconnecting from the filling line.  


(e) Carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid. 

(1) The following provisions apply to carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid, and nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid:  
(i) DOT 4L cylinders conforming to the provisions of this paragraph are authorized.  

(ii) Each cylinder must be protected with at least one pressure relief device and at least one frangible disc conforming to § 173.301(f) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The relieving capacity of the pressure relief device system must be equal to or greater than that calculated by the applicable formula in paragraph 5.8.3 of CGA S–1.1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).  

(iii) The temperature and pressure of the gas at the time the shipment is offered for transportation may not exceed −18 °C (0 °F) and 290 psig for carbon dioxide and −15.6 °C (+4 °F) and 290 psig for nitrous oxide. Maximum time in transit may not exceed 120 hours.

 § 173.304b Additional requirements for shipment of liquefied compressed gases in UN pressure receptacles. 
(a) General.  Liquefied gases and gas mixtures must be offered for transportation in UN pressure receptacles subject to the requirements in this section and § 173.304. In addition, the general requirements applicable to UN pressure receptacles in §§ 173.301 and 173.301b must be met.  

(b) UN pressure receptacle filling limits.  A UN pressure receptacle is authorized for the transportation of liquefied compressed gases and gas mixtures as specified in this section. When a liquefied compressed gas or gas mixture is transported in a UN pressure receptacle, the filling ratio may not exceed the maximum filling ratio prescribed in this section and the applicable ISO standard. Compliance with the filling limits may be determined by referencing the numerical values and data in Table 2 of P200 of the UN Recommendations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Alternatively, the maximum allowable filling limits may be determined as follows:  
(1) For high pressure liquefied gases, in no case may the filling ratio of the settled pressure at 65 °C (149 °F) exceed the test pressure of the UN pressure receptacle.  

(2) For low pressure liquefied gases, the maximum mass in kilograms of contents per liter of water capacity must be less than or equal to 95 percent of the liquid phase at 50 °C. In addition, the UN pressure receptacle may not be liquid full at 60 °C. The test pressure of the pressure receptacle must be equal to or greater than the vapor pressure of the liquid at 65 °C.  

(3) For high pressure liquefied gases or gas mixtures, the maximum filling ratio may be determined using the formulas in (3)(b) of P200 of the UN Recommendations.  

(4) For low pressure liquefied gases or gas mixtures, the maximum filling ratio may be determined using the formulas in (3)(c) of P200 of the UN Recommendations.  

(5) For liquefied gases charged with compressed gases, both components—the liquefied gas and the compressed gas—must be taken into consideration in the calculation of the internal pressure in the pressure receptacle. The maximum mass of contents per liter of water capacity shall not exceed 95 percent of the density of the liquid phase at 50 °C (122 °F); in addition, the liquid phase shall not completely fill the pressure receptacle at any temperature up to 60 °C (140 °F). When filled, the internal pressure at 65 °C (149 °F) shall not exceed the test pressure of the pressure receptacles. The vapor pressures and volumetric expansions of all substances in the pressure receptacles shall be considered. The maximum filling limits may be determined using the procedure in (3)(e) of P200 of the UN Recommendations.  


(c) Tetraflouroethylene, stabilized, UN1081 must be packaged in a pressure receptacle with a minimum test pressure of 200 bar and a working pressure not exceeding 5 bar.  
(d) Fertilizer ammoniating solution with free ammonia, UN1043 is not authorized in UN tubes or MEGCs.  [74 FR 2265, Jan. 14, 2009, as amended at 82 FR 15891, Mar. 30, 2017; 85 FR 27897, May 11, 2020; 87 FR 44997, July 26, 2022]  
 § 173.305 Charging of cylinders with a mixture of compressed gas and other material. 
(a) Detailed requirements.  A mixture of a compressed gas and any other material must be shipped as a compressed gas if the mixture is a compressed gas as designated in § 173.115 and when not in violation of § 173.301(a).  

(b) Filling limits.  (See § 173.301.) For mixtures, the liquid portion of the liquefied compressed gas at 131 °F. plus any additional liquid or solid must not completely fill the container.  

(c) Nonpoisonous and nonflammable mixtures.  Mixtures containing compressed gas or gases including insecticides, which mixtures are nonpoisonous and nonflammable under this part must be shipped in cylinders as prescribed in § 173.304(a) or as follows:  
(1) Specification 2P (§ 178.33 of this subchapter). Inside metal containers equipped with safety relief devices of a type examined by the Bureau of Explosives and approved by the Associate Administrator, and packed in strong wooden or fiber boxes of such design as to protect valves from damage or accidental functioning under conditions incident to transportation. Pressure in the container may not exceed 85 psia at 70 °F. Each completed metal container filled for shipment must be heated until content reaches a minimum temperature of 130 °F., without evidence of leakage, distortion or other defect. Each outside shipping container must be plainly marked “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH PRESCRIBED SPECIFICATIONS.”  

(2) [Reserved]  

(d) Poisonous mixtures.  A mixture containing any poisonous material (Division 6.1 or 2.3) in such proportions that the mixture would be classed as poisonous under § 173.115 or § 173.132 must be shipped in packagings as authorized for these poisonous materials.  [29 FR 18743, Dec. 29, 1964. Redesignated at 32 FR 5606, Apr. 5, 1967, and amended by Amdt. 173–70, 38 FR 5309, Feb. 27, 1973, Amdt. 173–94, 41 FR 16079, Apr. 15, 1976; 45 FR 32697, May 19, 1980; Amdt. 173–224, 56 FR 66275, 66279, Dec. 20, 1991; 66 FR 45379, Aug. 28, 2001; 67 FR 61013, Sept. 27, 2002; 67 FR 51651, Aug. 8, 2002; 68 FR 24662, May 8, 2003]  
 § 173.306 Limited quantities of compressed gases. 
(a) Limited quantities of compressed gases for which exceptions are permitted as noted by reference to this section in § 172.101 of this subchapter are excepted from labeling, except when offered for transportation or transported by air, and, unless required as a condition of the exception, specification packaging requirements of this subchapter when packaged in accordance with the following paragraphs. For transportation by aircraft, the package must conform to the applicable requirements of § 173.27 and only packages of hazardous materials authorized aboard passenger-carrying aircraft may be transported as a limited quantity. In addition, shipments are not subject to subpart F (Placarding) of part 172 of this subchapter, to part 174 of this subchapter except § 174.24, and to part 177 of this subchapter except § 177.817. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each package may not exceed 30 kg (66 lbs.) gross weight.  
(1) When in containers of not more than 4 fluid ounces capacity (7.22 cubic inches or less) except cigarette lighters. Additional exceptions for certain compressed gases in limited quantities are provided in paragraph (i) of this section.  

(2) When in refillable metal containers filled with a material that is not classed as a hazardous material to not more than 90% of capacity at 21.1 °C (70 °F) and then charged with nonflammable, nonliquefied gas. Each container must be tested to three times the pressure at 21.1 °C (70 °F) and, when refilled, be retested to three times the pressure of the gas at 21.1 °C (70 °F). Also, one of the following conditions must be met:  
(i) The container is not over 0.95 L (1 quart) capacity and charged to not more than 170 psig (1172.1 kPa) at 21.1 °C (70 °F), and must be packed in a strong outer packaging; or  

(ii) The container is not over 114 L (30 gallons) capacity and charged to not more than 75 psig (517.1 kPa) at 21.1 °C (70 °F).  


(3) When in a metal aerosol container (see § 171.8 of this subchapter for the definition of aerosol). Authorized containers include non-specification, DOT 2P (§ 178.33 of this subchapter), DOT 2Q (§ 178.33a of this subchapter), or DOT 2Q1 (§ 178.33(d) of this subchapter) design, provided the following conditions are met. Additional exceptions for aerosol containers conforming to this paragraph (a)(3) are provided in paragraph (i) of this section.

(iii) Liquid fill.  The liquid content of the material and gas must not completely fill the container at 54.4 °C (130 °F).  

(iv) Outer packaging.  The containers must be packed in strong outer packagings.  

(v) Pressure testing.  Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, each container, after it is filled, must be subjected to a test performed in a hot water bath; the temperature of the bath and the duration of the test must be such that the internal pressure reaches that which would be reached at 55 °C (131 °F), or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F)). If the contents are sensitive to heat, the temperature of the bath must be set at between 20 °C (68 °F) and 30 °C (86 °F) but, in addition, one container in 2,000 must be tested at the higher temperature. No leakage or permanent deformation of a container may occur. However, instead of this standard water bath test, container(s) may be tested using one of the following methods subject to certain conditions—  
(A) Alternative water bath test. 

(1) One filled container in a lot of 2,000 must be subjected to a test performed in a hot water bath; the temperature of the bath and the duration of the test must be such that the internal pressure reaches that which would be reached at 55 °C (131 °F). If the container shows evidence of leakage or permanent deformation, the lot of 2,000 containers must be rejected;  

(2) A second filled container in the lot of 2,000 must be weighed and compared to the weight specification for the containers as documented in the operating procedures for the weight test. Failure of the container to meet the weight specification is evidence of leakage or overfilling and the lot of 2,000 must be rejected;  

(3) The remainder of the containers in the lot of 2,000 must be visually inspected (e.g, examination of the seams). Containers showing evidence of leakage or overfilling must not be transported; and  

(4) Each person employing this test must maintain a copy of the operating procedures (or an electronic file thereof) that is accessible at, or through, its principal place of business and must make the procedures available upon request, at a reasonable time and location, to an authorized official of the Department.  


(B) Automated pressure test.  Each person employing an automated process for pressure testing of filled containers must develop procedures for implementation of the test. Each person must maintain a copy of the procedures (or an electronic file thereof) that is accessible at, or through, its principal place of business and must make the procedures available upon request, at a reasonable time and location, to an authorized official of the Department. The procedures must, at a minimum, include instruction on the following:  
(1) Pressure specifications. Each person must specify pressure standard(s) (e.g., a pressure limit or range) for a container respective of the design and/or contents. Each container, after it is filled, must be pressure checked and compared to the standards. For a pressure limit, any container exceeding the pressure limit must be rejected. For a pressure range, any container outside of the set range must be rejected. The instruments used to determine the pressure must be properly calibrated before a production run to an accuracy of ±or better; and  

(2) Periodic inspection. At designated intervals, a randomly selected container must be inspected for proper closure and verification of filling pressure. If a container shows signs of improper closure or over-filling, five (5) additional randomly selected containers must be inspected. If any of the additional containers show signs of improper closure or over-filling, all containers produced since the last inspection must be rejected.  


(C) Weight test.  Each person employing a weight test of filled containers must develop procedures for implementation of the test. Each person must maintain a copy of the procedures (or an electronic file thereof) that is accessible at, or through, its principal place of business and must make the procedures available upon request, at a reasonable time and location, to an authorized official of the Department. The procedures must, at a minimum, include instruction on the following:  
(1) Weight specifications. Each person must specify target weight specifications for a particular container. Each container, after it is filled, must be weighed and compared to the target weight specification for the container. Any container outside the target weight specification is an indication of leakage or overfilling and must be rejected. The instruments used to determine the weight must be properly calibrated before a testing run and be sufficiently sensitive to measure within 0.10 g of the true weight of the container;  

(2) Heat testing and pressure limits. One container out of each lot of successfully filled containers must be heat tested by raising the internal pressure until it reaches that which would be reached at 55 °C (131 °F). The lot size should be no greater than 2,000. If the pressure in the container exceeds the maximum pressure allowed for the container type or if the container shows signs of leakage or permanent deformation, the lot must be rejected. Alternatively, five (5) additional randomly selected containers from the lot may be tested to qualify the lot but if any of the five containers fail the test, the entire lot must be rejected;  

(3) Periodic inspection. At intervals of not more than 10 minutes, a randomly selected container must be inspected for proper closure and verification of filling pressure. If a container shows signs of improper closure or over-filling, five (5) additional randomly selected containers must be inspected. If any of the additional containers show signs of improper closure or over-filling, all containers produced since the last inspection must be rejected; and  

(4) Visual inspection. Each container must be visually inspected prior to being packed. Any container showing signs of leakage or permanent deformation must be rejected.  


(D) Leakage test. 

(1) Pressure and leak testing before filling. Each empty container must be subjected to a pressure equal to or in excess of the maximum expected in the filled containers at 55 °C (131 °F) or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F). This must be at least two-thirds of the design pressure of the container. If any container shows evidence of leakage at a rate equal to or greater than 3.3 × 10−2 mbar L/s at the test pressure, distortion or other defect, it must be rejected; and  

(2) Testing after filling. The person filling each container must ensure that the crimping equipment is set appropriately and the specified propellant is used before filling a container. Once filled, each container must be weighed and leak tested. The leak detection equipment must be sufficiently sensitive to detect at least a leak rate of 2.0 × 10−3 mbar L/s at 20 °C (68 °F). Any filled container which shows evidence of leakage, deformation, or overfilling must be rejected.  



(vi) Each outer packaging must be marked “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH PRESCRIBED REGULATIONS.”  


(4) Gas samples must be transported under the following conditions:  
(i) A gas sample may only be transported as non-pressurized gas when its pressure corresponding to ambient atmospheric pressure in the container is not more than 105 kPa absolute (15.22 psia).  

(ii) Non-pressurized gases, toxic (or toxic and flammable) must be packed in hermetically sealed glass or metal inner packagings of not more than one L (0.3 gallons) overpacked in a strong outer packaging.

If the contents are sensitive to heat, or if the container is made of plastic material which softens at this test temperature, the temperature of the bath must be set at between 20 °C (68 °F) and 30 °C (86 °F) but, in addition, one container in 2,000 must be tested at the higher temperature. No leakage or permanent deformation of a container is permitted except that a plastic container may be deformed through softening provided that it does not leak.  

(vi) Leakage test.  As an alternative to the hot water bath test in paragraph (a)(5)(v) of this section, testing may be performed as follows:  
(A) Pressure and leak testing before filling. Each empty container must be subjected to a pressure equal to or in excess of the maximum expected in the filled containers at 55 °C (131 °F) or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F). This must be at least two-thirds of the design pressure of the container. If any container shows evidence of leakage at a rate equal to or greater than 3.3 × 10−2 mbar L/s at the test pressure, distortion or other defect, it must be rejected; and  

(B) Testing after filling. Prior to filling, the filler must ensure that the crimping equipment is set appropriately and the specified propellant is used before filling the container. Once filled, each container must be weighed and leak tested. The leak detection equipment must be sufficiently sensitive to detect at least a leak rate of 2.0 × 10−3 mbar L/s at 20 °C (68 °F). Any filled container that shows evidence of leakage, deformation, or excessive weight must be rejected.

 § 173.308 Lighters. 
(a) General requirements.  No person may offer for transportation or transport a lighter (see § 171.8 of this subchapter) containing a Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material except under the following conditions:  
(1) The lighter must contain a fuel reservoir not exceeding 4 fluid ounces capacity (7.22 cubic inches), and must contain not more than 10 grams (0.35 ounce) of flammable gas.  

(2) The maximum filling density may not exceed 85 percent of the volumetric capacity of each fluid reservoir at 15 °C (59 °F).  

(3) Each lighter design, including closures, must be capable of withstanding, without leakage or rupture, an internal pressure of at least two times the pressure of the flammable gas at 55 °C (131 °F).  

(4) Each appropriate lighter design must be examined and successfully tested by a person or agency (authorized testing agency) who is authorized by the Associate Administrator to perform such examination and testing under the provisions of subpart E of part 107 of this chapter and who—  
(i) Has the equipment necessary to perform the testing required to the level of accuracy required;  

(ii) Is able to demonstrate, upon request, the knowledge of the testing procedures and requirements of the HMR relative to lighters;  

(iii) Does not manufacture or market lighters, is not financially dependent or owned in whole or in part, by any entity that manufactures or markets lighters;  

(iv) Is a resident of the United States; and  

(v) Performs all examination and testing in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) and (4) of this section.  


(5) The Associate Administrator will assign an identification code to each person who is authorized to examine and test lighters. This identification code must be incorporated into a unique test report identifier for each successfully tested lighter design.  


(b) Examination and testing of lighter design types —

(1) Lighter design type definition.  A new lighter design is one that has never been examined and tested or one that differs from a previous design in any manner that may affect the escape (leakage) of gas. Lighter characteristics that may affect the escape of gas include changes in materials of construction, ignition mechanism, burner valve design, wall thickness, sealing materials, and type of fuel (e.g., vapor pressure differences).  

(2) Lighter samples submitted for examination and testing.  Samples of a new lighter design are excepted from the requirements of (a)(4) and (d) of this section and may be offered for transportation and transported under the following conditions:  
(i) The samples must be transported only to an authorized testing agency;  

(ii) No more than 12 lighters may be packaged in a single outer packaging;  

(iii) Inner packagings must conform to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For transportation by aircraft, intermediate or outer packagings must meet the pressure differential requirements of § 173.27(c) of this part;  

(iv) The outer packaging must conform to the requirements of subpart M of part 178 of this subchapter at the Packing Group I performance level and to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subpart;  

(v) The word “sample” must appear on the shipping paper as part of the proper shipping name or in association with the basic description; and  

(vi) In addition to other required markings and labels, the package must be marked “SAMPLE FOR EXAMINATION AND TESTING.”  

(vii) All other applicable requirements of this subchapter must be met.  


(3) Examination and testing of sample lighters by an authorized testing agency.  Each sample lighter must be examined for conformance with paragraph (a) of this section by a person authorized by the Associate Administrator. In addition, lighters must be subjected to the following leakage test:  
(i) A minimum of six lighters must be examined and tested at one time. Store the lighters in a desiccator for 24 hours. After drying, weigh each lighter on an analytical balance capable of accurately measuring to within 1⁄10 of a milligram (0.0001 grams).  

(ii) After weighing, place the lighters together in an explosion-proof, controlled-temperature laboratory oven capable of maintaining 38 ±1 °C (100 ±2 °F) for 96 continuous hours (4 days). At the end of 96 hours, remove the lighters from the oven and place them in the same desiccator and allow the lighters to cool to ambient temperature.  

(iii) After cooling, weigh each lighter and determine the net weight differences for each lighter tested (subtract the mass after oven exposure from the original mass before oven exposure).  

(iv) Weight losses must be assessed to determine the quantity of gas that leaked from the lighters and from the weight change as a result of absorbed moisture. If the net weight has increased, the test facility must run the required test using six empty lighters in parallel with the six filled lighters. The parallel tests are conducted to determine the weight of moisture absorbed in the plastic in order to determine the weight loss of the lighters from gas leakage.  

(v) If the net weight loss for any one of the six lighters exceeds 20 milligrams (0.020 grams), the design must be rejected.  

(vi) Lighters manufactured to a rejected lighter design may not be offered for transportation or transported in commerce unless approved in writing by the Associate Administrator.  


(4) Recordkeeping requirements. 

(i) Following the examination of each new lighter design, the person or agency that conducted the examination and test must prepare a test report and make that test report available to the manufacturer. At a minimum, the test report must contain the following information:  
(A) Name and address of test facility;  

(B) Name and address of applicant;  

(C) A test report identifier, that is, the authorized person or agency identifier code immediately followed by an alpha/numeric identifier of four or more characters assigned to the specific lighter design by the authorized person or agency (e.g., “LAA****,” where, “LAA” is the identification code assigned to the authorized person or agency by the Associate Administrator and “****” is replaced with the unique test report identifier assigned to the specific lighter design by the authorized person or agency);  

(D) Manufacturer of the lighter. For a foreign manufacturer, the U.S. agent or importer must be identified;  

(E) Description of the lighter design type (e.g., model, dimensions, ignition mechanism, reservoir capacity, lot/batch number) in sufficient detail to ensure conformance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section; and  

(F) A certification by the authorized testing agency that the lighter design conforms to paragraph (a) of this section and passes or does not pass the required leakage test in paragraph (b) of this section.  


(ii) For as long as any lighter design is in production and for at least three years thereafter, a copy of each lighter's test report must be maintained by the authorized testing agency that performed the examination and testing and the manufacturer of the design. For a foreign manufacturer, each test report must be maintained in accordance with this paragraph by the foreign manufacturer's U.S. agent or importer.  

(iii) Test reports must be traceable to a specific lighter design and must be made available to a representative of the Department upon request.  


(5) Transitional provisions.  Until January 1, 2012, approval numbers issued by the Associate Administrator prior to January 1, 2007 may continue to be marked on packages and annotated on shipping papers, where applicable. After that time, previously issued approvals (i.e., T-***) will no longer be valid and each lighter design currently in production must be re-examined and tested under the provisions of this section.  


(c) Packaging requirements —

(1) Inner containment.  Lighters must be placed in an inner packaging that is designed to prevent shifting of the lighters and inadvertent ignition or leakage. The ignition device and gas control lever of each lighter must be designed, or securely sealed, taped, or otherwise fastened or packaged to protect against accidental functioning or leakage of the contents during transport. If lighters are packed vertically in a plastic tray, a plastic, fiberboard or paperboard partition must be used to prevent friction between the ignition device and the inner packaging.  

(2) Outer packaging.  Lighters and their inner packagings must be tightly packed and secured against shifting in any rigid specification outer packaging authorized in subpart L of part 178 of this subchapter at the Packing Group II performance level.  


(d) Shipping paper and marking requirements. 

(1) In addition to the requirements of subpart C of part 172, shipping papers must be annotated with the lighter design test report identifier (see paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section) traceable to the test report assigned to the lighters or, if applicable, the previously issued approval number (i.e., T* * *), in association with the basic description.  

(2) In addition to the requirements of subpart D of part 172, a lighter design test report identifier (see paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section) or, if applicable, the previously issued approval number (i.e., T* * *), must be marked on a package containing lighters.  


(e) Exceptions —

(1) Common or contract carriage.  For highway transportation by common or contract carrier, when no more than 1,500 lighters covered by this section are transported in one motor vehicle, the requirements of subparts C through H of part 172, and part 177 of this subchapter do not apply. Lighters transported in accordance with this paragraph are also excepted from the specification packaging, shipping paper, and marking requirements specified in § 173.308(c) and (d). Inner packagings must conform to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Lighters must be further packaged in rigid, strong outer packagings meeting the general packaging requirements of subpart B of part 173. Outer packagings must be plainly and durably marked, on two opposing sides or ends, with the word “LIGHTERS” and the number of devices contained therein in letters measuring at least 20 mm (0.79 in) in height. In addition, the package must include the test report identifier for each lighter design as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section or, if applicable, the previously issued approval number (i.e., T***). The test report identifier or approval number must be durable, legible, in English, and located in, attached to, or marked directly on the package. No person may offer for transportation or transport the lighters or prepare the lighters for shipment unless that person has been specifically informed of the requirements of this section.  

(2) Private carriage.  For highway transportation by a private carrier, lighters that have been examined and successfully tested in accordance with this section are not subject to any other requirements of this subchapter under the following conditions:  
(i) No person may offer for transportation or transport the lighters or prepare the lighters for shipment unless that person has been specifically informed of the requirements of this section;  

(ii) Lighters must be placed in an inner packaging that is designed to prevent accidental activation of the ignition device or valve, release of gas, and shifting of the lighters (e.g., tray, blister pack, etc.);  

(iii) Inner packagings must be placed in a securely closed rigid outer packaging that limits shifting of the inner packagings and protects them from damage;  

(iv) The outer package may contain not more than 300 lighters;  

(v) A transport vehicle may carry not more than 1,500 lighters at any one time;  

(vi) The lighters may not be placed in an outer packaging with other hazardous materials; and

 § 173.314 Compressed gases in tank cars and multi-unit tank cars. 
(a) Definitions.  For definitions of compressed gases, see § 173.115.  

(b) General requirements. 

(1) Tank car tanks containing compressed gases must not be shipped unless they were loaded by or with the consent of the owner thereof.  

(2) Tank car tanks must not contain gases capable of combining chemically and must not be loaded with any gas which combines chemically with the gas previously loaded therein, until all residue has been removed and interior of tank thoroughly cleaned.  

(3) For tanks of the DOT-106A and 110A class, the tanks must be placed in position and attached to car structure by the shipper.  

(4) Wherever the word “approved” is used in this part of the regulations, it means approval by the Association of American Railroads Committee on Tank Cars as prescribed in § 179.3 of this subchapter.  

(5) Each tank car used for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia or any material that meets the criteria of Division 2.1 or 2.3 must have gaskets for manway cover plates and for mounting of fittings designed (for temperature, application, media, pressure, and size) to create a positive seal so that, under conditions normally incident to transportation, there will not be an identifiable release of the material to the environment. The use of sealants to install gaskets is prohibited.  


(c) Authorized gases, filling limits for tank cars.  A compressed gas in a tank car or a multi-unit tank car must be offered for transportation in accordance with § 173.31 and this section. The gases listed below must be loaded and offered for transportation in accordance with the following table:

Notes to table 1 to paragraph (c): 
1. The filling density percentage for liquefied gases is hereby defined as the percent ratio of the mass of gas in the tank to the mass of water that the tank will hold. For determining the water capacity of the tank in kilograms, the mass of 1 L of water at 15.5 °C in air is 1 kg (the mass of one gallon of water at 60 °F in air is 8.32828 pounds). 
2. The liquefied gas must be loaded so that the outage is at least two percent of the total capacity of the tank at the reference temperature of 46 °C (115 °F) for a non-insulated tank; 43 °C (110 °F) for a tank having a thermal protection system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour—per square meter—per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential; and 41 °C (105 °F) for an insulated tank having an insulation system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 1.5333 kilojoules per hour—per square meter—per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential. 
3. The requirements of § 173.24b(a) apply. 
4. The gas pressure at 54.44 °C (130 °F) in any non-insulated tank car may not exceed 7/10 of the marked test pressure, except that a tank may be charged with helium to a pressure of 10 percent in excess of the marked maximum gas pressure at 54.44 °C (130 °F) of each tank. 
5. The liquid portion of the gas at −17.77 °C (0 °F) must not completely fill the tank. 
6. The maximum permitted filling density is 125 percent. The quantity of chlorine loaded into a single unit-tank car may not be loaded in excess of the normal lading weights nor in excess of 81.65 Mg (90 tons). 
7. 89 percent maximum to 80.1 percent minimum at a test pressure of 6.2 bar (90 psig). 
8. 59.6 percent maximum to 53.6 percent minimum at a test pressure of 7.2 bar (105 psig). 
9. For a liquefied petroleum gas, the liquefied gas must be loaded so that the outage is at least one percent of the total capacity of the tank at the reference temperature of 46 °C (115 °F) for a non-insulated tank; 43 °C (110 °F) for a tank having a thermal protection system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour—per square meter—per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential; and 41 °C (105 °F) for an insulated tank having an insulation system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 1.5333 kilojoules per hour—per square meter—per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential. 
10. For liquefied petroleum gas and anhydrous ammonia, during the months of November through March (winter), the following reference temperatures may be used: 38 °C (100 °F) for a non-insulated tank; 32 °C (90 °F) for a tank having a thermal protection system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour—per square meter—per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential; and 29 °C (85 °F) for an insulated tank having an insulation system incorporating a metal jacket and insulation that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 1.5333 kilojoules per hour—per square meter—per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential. The winter reference temperatures may only be used for a tank car shipped directly to a consumer for unloading and not stored in transit. The offeror of the tank must inform each customer that the tank car was filled based on winter reference temperatures. The tank must be unloaded as soon as possible after March in order to retain the specified outage and to prevent a release of hazardous material, which might occur due to the tank car becoming liquid full at higher temperatures. 
11. For materials poisonous by inhalation, until December 31, 2027, the single unit tank car tanks authorized are only those cars approved by the Tank Car Committee for transportation of the specified material and built prior to March 16, 2009. After December 31, 2027, all single unit tank cars used in PIH/TIH service must meet the requirements of Note 12. 
12. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, for materials poisonous by inhalation, fusion-welded tank car tanks built on or after March 16, 2009, used for the transportation of the PIH materials noted, must meet the applicable authorized tank car specification and must be equipped with a head shield as prescribed in § 179.16(c)(1).

 

(d) Alternative tank car tanks for materials poisonous by inhalation. 

(1) As an alternative to the authorized tank car specification noted in the column 4 of the table in paragraph (c) of this section, a car of the same authorized tank car specification but of the next lower test pressure, as prescribed in column 5 of the table at § 179.101–1, may be used provided both of the following conditions are met:  
(i) The difference between the alternative and the required minimum plate thicknesses, based on the calculation prescribed in § 179.100–6 of this subchapter, is added to the alternative tank car jacket and head shield. When the jacket and head shield are made from any authorized steel with a minimum tensile strength from 70,000 p.s.i. to 80,000 p.s.i., but the required minimum plate thickness calculation is based on steel with a minimum tensile strength of 81,000 p.s.i., the thickness to be added to the jacket and head shield must be increased by a factor of 1.157. Forming allowances for heads are not required to be considered when calculating thickness differences as prescribed in this paragraph.  

(ii) The tank car jacket and head shield must be manufactured from carbon steel plate as prescribed in § 179.100–7(a) of this subchapter.  



(e) Verification of content. 

(1) The amount of liquefied gas loaded into each tank may be determined either by measurement or calculation of the weight, except that DOT specification tank car tanks authorized for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia and ammonia solution may have the amount of liquefied gas loaded into the tank car measured by a metering device in conformance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.  

(2) Metering device. 

(i) Tank cars loaded with anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution through the use of a metering device in conformance with this section are not required to be weighed, but must have their outage measured with a magnetic gauging device to determine that the tank car is properly loaded in conformance with this paragraph. Written procedures for loading a tank car using a metering device must be developed and made available at each location where such loading takes place. Certification in writing of the inspection and completion of these loading and/or unloading procedures must be maintained for each tank car and maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, and all necessary records must be completed. At a minimum, these procedures will specify:  
(A) The tank car must be offered for transportation in conformance with all applicable government regulations.  

(B) Any defects found when the tank car is examined before shipping must be recorded, and the tank must not be loaded until the repairs to eliminate each defect are completed.  

(C) The tank car must be allowed to sit undisturbed for at least 10 minutes after loading to allow material within the tank to settle. After this has occurred a final check for leaks must be conducted prior to offering the tank car for transportation.  


(ii) One out of every 10 tank cars loaded by the use of the metering device must be gauged utilizing the fixed gauging equipment on the tank car to verify by calculation the amount of anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution contained in the tank car.  

(iii) Recordkeeping.  The following information must be maintained and be made available to any representative of the DOT upon request for each tank car loaded with the use of a metering device:  
(A) Date loaded,  

(B) Date shipped,  

(C) Tank car reporting marks,  

(D) DOT Specification,

(H) Water capacity of tank in pounds and/or kilograms,  

(I) Maximum permitted filling density (see § 173.314),  

(J) Specific gravity of anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution at the reference temperature,  

(K) Tank car outage (inches/meters, gallons/liters),  

(L) Gallons/liters of liquid ammonia in tank car,  

(M) Quantity of vapor ammonia in tank car (gallons/liters), and  

(N) Total calculated ammonia (liquid & vapor) in tank car (pounds/kilograms).  




(f) [Reserved]  

(g) Special requirements for hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid, and vinyl fluoride,stabilized.  
(1) The shipper shall notify the Federal Railroad Administration whenever a tank car is not received by the consignee within 20 days from the date of shipment. Notification to the Federal Railroad Administration may be made by e-mail to Hmassist@fra.dot.gov or telephone call to (202) 493–6229.  

(2) A tank car containing hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid must have the auxiliary valve on the pressure relief device closed during transportation.  

(3) See § 179.102–17 of this subchapter for additional requirements.  

(4) Tank cars containing hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid, must be unloaded to such an extent that any residue remaining in the tank at a reference temperature of 32 °C (90 °F) will not actuate the reclosing pressure relief device.  


(h) Special requirements for liquefied petroleum gas —

(1) Odorization.  All liquefied petroleum gas must be odorized as required in this paragraph to indicate positively, by a distinctive odor, the presence of gas down to a concentration in air of not over one-fifth the lower limit of combustibility; however, odorization is not required if it is harmful in the use or further processing of the liquefied petroleum gas or if it will serve no useful purpose as a warning agent in such use or further processing.  
(i) The lower limits of combustibility of the more commonly used liquefied petroleum gases are: Propane, 2.15 percent; butane, 1.55 percent. These figures represent volumetric percentages of gas-air mixtures in each case.  

(ii) The use of 1.0 pound of ethyl mercaptan per 10,000 gallons of liquefied petroleum gas is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph. Use of another odorant is not prohibited so long as there is enough to meet the requirements of this paragraph (h).  


(2) Odorant fade.  In addition to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the offeror must ensure that enough odorant will remain in the tank car during the course of transportation. The offeror must have procedures in place to:  
(i) Ensure quantitative testing methods are used to measure the amount of odorant in the liquefied petroleum gas;  

(ii) Ensure that, when the odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is manually injected, the required amount of odorant is added;  

(iii) Ensure that, when odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is automatically injected, equipment calibration checks are conducted to ensure the required amount of odorant is consistently added;  

(iv) Ensure quality control measures are in place to make sure that persons who receive tank cars that have been subjected to any condition that could lead to corrosion of the tank car or receive new or recently cleaned tank cars are notified of this information and that a person filling these packagings implement quality control measures so that potential odorant fade is addressed;  

(v) Inspect a tank car for signs of oxidation or corrosion; and  

(vi) Take corrective action needed to ensure enough odorization remains in the tank car during the course of transportation, such as increasing the amount of odorant added to the liquefied petroleum gas.  



(i) [Reserved]  

(j) Special requirements for materials having a primary or secondary Division 2.1 (flammable gas) hazard.  For single unit tank cars, interior pipes of loading and unloading valves, sampling devices, and gauging devices with an opening for the passage of the lading exceeding 1.52 mm (0.060 inch) diameter must be equipped with excess flow valves. For single unit tank cars constructed before January 1, 1972, gauging devices must conform to this paragraph by no later than July 1, 2006. The protective housing cover must be provided with an opening, with a weatherproof cover, above each pressure relief valve that is concentric with the discharge of the pressure relief valve and that has an area at least equal to the valve outlet area.

 Note 1: Filling is permitted by volume provided the same filling density is used as permitted by weight, except when using fixed length dip tube or other fixed maximum liquid level indicators (paragraph (f) of this section), in which case the maximum permitted filling density shall not exceed 97 percent of the maximum permitted filling density by weight contained in the table.
 
(1) Odorization.  All liquefied petroleum gas must be odorized as required in this paragraph to indicate positively, by a distinctive odor, the presence of gas down to a concentration in air of not over one-fifth the lower limit of combustibility; however, odorization is not required if it is harmful in the use or further processing of the liquefied petroleum gas or if it will serve no useful purpose as a warning agent in such use or further processing.  
(i) The lower limits of combustibility of the more commonly used liquefied petroleum gases are: Propane, 2.15 percent; butane, 1.55 percent. These figures represent volumetric percentages of gas-air mixtures in each case.  

(ii) The use of 1.0 pound of ethyl mercaptan per 10,000 gallons of liquefied petroleum gas is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph (b). Use of any other odorant is not prohibited so long as there is enough to meet the requirements of this paragraph.  


(2) Odorant fade.  For cargo tanks or portable tanks being transported from a refinery, gas plant or pipeline terminal and in addition to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the offeror must ensure that enough odorant will remain in the cargo tank or portable tank during the course of transportation. The offeror must have procedures in place to:  
(i) Ensure quantitative testing methods are used to measure the amount of odorant in the liquefied petroleum gas;  

(ii) Ensure that, when the odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is manually injected, the required amount of odorant is being added;  

(iii) Ensure that, when odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is automatically injected, equipment calibration checks are conducted to ensure the required amount of odorant is consistently added;  

(iv) Ensure that quality control measures are in place to make sure that persons who receive cargo tanks or portable tanks that have been subjected to any condition that could lead to corrosion of the packaging or receive new or recently cleaned cargo tanks or portable tanks are notified of this information and that a person filling these packagings implement quality control measures to ensure that potential odorant fade is addressed;  

(v) Inspect a cargo tank or portable tank for signs of oxidation or corrosion; and  

(vi) Take corrective action needed to ensure enough odorant remains in the cargo tank or portable tank during the course of transportation, such as increasing the amount of odorant added to the liquefied petroleum gas.  



(c) Except as otherwise provided, the loading of a liquefied gas into a cargo tank or portable tank shall be determined by weight or by a suitable liquid level gauging device. The vapor pressure (psig) at 115 °F. must not exceed the design pressure of the cargo tank or portable tank container. The outage and filling limits for liquefied gases must be as prescribed in § 173.24b of this part, except that this requirement does not apply to:  
(1) A tank containing carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid.  Such tank is required to be equipped with suitable pressure control valves and may not be filled to a level exceeding 95 percent of the volumetric capacity of the tank.  

(2) A tank containing ethane, refrigerated liquid; ethane-propane mixture, refrigerated liquid; or hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid.  Such tank must be filled to allow at least two percent outage below the inlet of the pressure relief valve or pressure control valve under conditions of incipient opening, with the tank in a level attitude.  


(d) If the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied gases is to be determined by weight, the gross weight shall be checked after the filling line is disconnected in each instance. The gross weight shall be calculated from the tank capacity and tare weight set forth on the metal plate required by the specification, and the maximum filling density permitted for the material being loaded into the tank as set forth in the table, paragraph (a) of this section.  

(e) If the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied gases is to be determined by adjustable liquid level device, each tank and each compartment thereof shall have a thermometer well, so that the internal liquid temperature can easily be determined, and the amount of liquid in the tank shall be corrected to a 60 °F. basis. Liquid levels shall not exceed a level corresponding to the maximum filling density permitted for the material being loaded into the tank as set forth in the table in paragraph (a) of this section.  

(f) When the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied gases is determined only by fixed length dip tube or other fixed maximum liquid level indicator, the device shall be arranged to function at a level not to exceed the maximum permitted volume prescribed by the table, paragraph (a) of this section. Loading shall be stopped when the device functions.  

(g) Containers, the liquid level of which has been determined by means of a fixed length dip tube gauging device, shall not be acceptable for stowage as cargo on vessels in commerce subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard. Nothing contained in this section shall be so construed as to prohibit the transportation on car floats or car ferries of motor vehicles laden with containers nor cargo tanks the liquid level of either of which has been determined by means of fixed length dip tube devices.  

(h) Each cargo tank and portable tank, except a tank filled by weight, must be equipped with one or more of the gauging devices described in the following table which indicate accurately the maximum permitted liquid level (for purposes of the following table, a column entry with “do” indicates “same as above”). Additional gauging devices may be installed but may not be used as primary controls for filling of cargo tanks and portable tanks. Gauge glasses are not permitted on any cargo tank or portable tank. Primary gauging devices used on cargo tanks of less than 3500 gallons water capacity are exempt from the longitudinal location requirements specified in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section provided: The tank length does not exceed three times the tank diameter; and the cargo tank is unloaded within 24 hours after each filling of the tank.

(1) The design pressure of the liquid level gauging devices shall be at least equal to the design pressure of the tank.  

(2) If the primary gauging device is adjustable, it must be capable of adjustment so that the end of the tube will be in the location specified in paragraph (h)(3) of this section for at least one of the ladings to be transported, at the filling level corresponding to an average loading temperature. Exterior means must be provided to indicate this adjustment. The gauging device must be legibly and permanently marked in increments not exceeding 20 Fahrenheit degrees (or not exceeding 25 p.s.i.g. on tanks for carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid), to indicate the maximum levels to which the tank may be filled with liquid at temperatures above 20 °F. However, if it is not practicable to so mark the gauging device, this information must be legibly and permanently marked on a plate affixed to the tank adjacent to the gauging device.  

(3) A dip tube gauging device consists of a pipe or tube with a valve at its outer end with its intake limited by an orifice not larger than 0.060 inch in diameter. If a fixed length dip tube is used, the intake must be located midway of the tank both longitudinally and laterally and at maximum permitted filling level. In tanks for liquefied petroleum gases, the intake must be located at the level reached by the lading when the tank is loaded to maximum filling density at 40 °F.  

(4) Except on a tank used exclusively for the transportation of carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid, each opening for a pressure gauge must be restricted at or inside the tank by an orifice no larger than 0.060 inch in diameter. For carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid service, the pressure gauge need only be used during the filling operation.  


(i) Each tank must be provided with one or more pressure relief devices which, unless otherwise specified in this part, must be of the spring-loaded type. Each valve must be arranged to discharge upward and unobstructed to the outside of the protective housing to prevent any impingement of escaping gas upon the tank. For each chlorine tank the protective housing must be in compliance with the requirements set forth in the applicable specification.  
(1) The safety relief valves on each tank must meet the following conditions:  
(i) The total relieving capacity, as determined by the flow formulas contained in Section 5 of CGA S–1.2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), must be sufficient to prevent a maximum pressure in the tank of more than 120 percent of the design pressure;  

(ii) The flow capacity rating, testing and marking must be in accordance with Sections 5, 6 and 7 of CGA Pamphlet S–1.2.  

(iii) For an insulated tank, the required relieving capacity of the relief devices must be the same as for an uninsulated tank, unless the insulation will remain in place and will be effective under fire conditions. In this case, except for UN portable tanks, each insulated tank must be covered by a sheet metal jacket of not less than 16 gauge thickness. For UN portable tanks where the relieving capacity of the valves has been reduced on the basis of the insulation system, the insulation system must remain effective at all temperatures less than 649 °C (1200.2 °F) and be jacketed with a material having a melting point of 700 °C (1292.0 °F) or greater.  

(iv) An MC 330 cargo tank that has relief valves sized by Fetterly's formula dated November 27, 1928, may be continued in service.  


(2) Each safety relief valve must be arranged to minimize the possibility of tampering. If the pressure setting or adjustment is external to the valve, the safety relief valve must be provided with means for sealing the adjustment and it must be sealed.  

(3) Each safety relief valve on a portable tank, other than a UN portable tank, must be set to start-to-discharge at pressure no higher than 110% of the tank design pressure and no lower than the design pressure specified in paragraph (a) of this section for the gas transported. For UN portable tanks used for liquefied compressed gases and constructed in accordance with the requirements of § 178.276 of this subchapter, the pressure relief device(s) must conform to § 178.276(e) of this subchapter.  

(4) Except for UN portable tanks, each safety relief valve must be plainly and permanently marked with the pressure in p.s.i.g. at which it is set to discharge, with the actual rate of discharge of the device in cubic feet per minute of the gas or of air at 60 °F (15.6 °C) and 14.7 p.s.i.a., and with the manufacturer's name or trade name and catalog number. The start-to-discharge valve marking must be visible after the valve is installed. The rated discharge capacity of the device must be determined at a pressure of 120% of the design pressure of the tank. For UN portable tanks, each pressure relief device must be clearly and permanently marked as specified in § 178.274(f)(1) of this subchapter.  

(5) Each safety relief valve must have direct communication with the vapor space in the tank.  

(6) Each connection to a safety relief valve must be of sufficient size to provide the required rate of discharge through the safety relief valve.  

(7) [Reserved]  

(8) Each pressure relief valve outlet must be provided with a protective device to prevent the entrance and accumulation of dirt and water. This device must not impede flow through the valve. Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of liquid and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.  

(9) On tanks for carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid each safety relief device must be installed and located so that the cooling effect of the contents will not prevent the effective operation of the device. In addition to the required safety relief valves, these tanks may be equipped with one or more pressure controlling devices.  

(10) Each tank for carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid also may be equipped with one or more non-reclosing pressure relief devices set to function at a pressure not over two times nor less than 1.5 times the design pressure of the tank.  

(11) Each portion of connected liquid piping or hose that can be closed at both ends must be provided with a safety relief valve without an intervening shut-off valve to prevent excessive hydrostatic pressure that could burst the piping or hose.  

(12) Subject to conditions of paragraph (a) of this section for the methyl chloride and sulfur dioxide optional portable tanks, one or more fusible plugs examined by the Bureau of Explosives and approved by the Associate Administrator may be used on these tanks in place of safety relief valves of the spring-loaded type. The fusible plug or plugs must be in accordance with CGA Pamphlet S–1.2, to prevent a pressure rise in the tank of more than 120 percent of the design pressure. If the tank is over 30 inches long, each end must have the total specified safety discharge area.  

(13) A safety relief valve on a chlorine cargo tank must conform to one of the following standards of The Chlorine Institute, Inc.: Type 11⁄2 JQ225, Dwg. H51970 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); or Type 11⁄2 JQ225, Dwg. H50155 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(2) Storage containers with a water capacity not exceeding 500 gallons charged with liquefied petroleum gas to more than five percent of their capacity and intended for permanent installation on consumer premises may be transported by private motor carrier one-way only from the consumer's premises to the container owner's nearest facility under the following conditions:  
(i) Each container must be constructed in compliance with the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code and must be marked to indicate compliance in the manner specified by the respective Code.  

(ii) Maximum permitted filling density may not exceed that specified in paragraph (b) of this section.  

(iii) Prior to loading on a motor vehicle, the container must be inspected by a trained and qualified person for leaks, corroded or abraded areas, dents, distortions, weld defects, or other condition that may render the container unsafe for transportation. A record of the inspection must be legibly signed and dated by the person performing the inspection and retained by the container owner for two years. The signature on the inspection record represents a certification that the container has been inspected and has no defects that would render it unsafe for transportation under the HMR. The record of inspection must include the date of inspection, the inspector's contact information (such as a telephone number), the container's serial number and container size (water capacity), estimated amount of hazardous material, and the origin and destination of shipment.  

(iv) Only one storage container may be transported on a motor vehicle.  

(v) For loading on a motor vehicle, the container must be lifted by slings, which must be completely wrapped around the container. Lifting lugs may not be used. The slings must be rated to a weight sufficient to accommodate the container and its lading and shall comply with ASME B30.9 on slings used for lifting purposes, and must be visually inspected prior to each use. A sling showing evidence of tears, fraying, or other signs of excessive wear may not be used.

(2) Cargo tank motor vehicles in other than metered delivery service.  A cargo tank motor vehicle in other than metered delivery service must have a means to automatically shut off the flow of product without the need for human intervention within 20 seconds of an unintentional release caused by a complete separation of a liquid delivery hose (passive shut-down capability).  
(i) Designed flow of product through a bypass in the valve is acceptable when authorized by this subchapter.  

(ii) The design for the means to automatically shut off product flow must be certified by a Design Certifying Engineer. The certification must consider any specifications of the original component manufacturer and must explain how the passive means to shut off the flow of product operates. It must also outline the parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, types of product) within which the passive means to shut off the flow of product is designed to operate. All components of the discharge system that are integral to the design must be included in the certification. A copy of the design certification must be provided to the owner of the cargo tank motor vehicle on which the equipment will be installed.  

(iii) Installation must be performed under the supervision of a Registered Inspector unless the equipment is installed and removed as part of regular operation (e.g., a hose). The Registered Inspector must certify that the equipment is installed and tested, if it is possible to do so without damaging the equipment, in accordance with the Design Certifying Engineer's certification. The Registered Inspector must provide the certification to the owner of the cargo tank motor vehicle.  


(3) Cargo tank motor vehicles in metered delivery service.  When required by the table in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, a cargo tank motor vehicle must have an off-truck remote means to close the internal self-closing stop valve and shut off all motive and auxiliary power equipment upon activation by a qualified person attending the unloading of the cargo tank motor vehicle (off-truck remote shut-off). It must function reliably at a distance of 45.72 m (150 feet). The off-truck remote shut-off activation device must not be capable of reopening the internal self-closing stop valve after emergency activation.

(4) Mixtures of cryogenic liquid.  Where charging requirements are not specifically prescribed in this paragraph (f), the cryogenic liquid must be shipped in packagings and under conditions approved by the Associate Administrator.  


(g) One-way travel time; marking.  The jacket of a cargo tank to be used to transport a flammable cryogenic liquid must be marked on its right side near the front, in letters and numbers at least two inches high, “One-Way-Travel-Time __ hrs.”, with the blank filled in with a number indicating the one-way travel time (OWTT), in hours, of the cargo tank for the flammable cryogenic liquid to be transported. A cargo tank that is partially unloaded at one or more locations must have additional marking “One-Way-Travel-Time __ hrs. __ psig to __ psig at __ percent filling density,” with the second blank filled in with the pressure existing after partial unloading and the third blank filled in with the set-to-discharge pressure of the control valve or pressure relief valve, and the fourth blank with the filling density following partial unloading. Multiple OWTT markings for different pressure levels are permitted. The abbreviation “OWTT” may be used in place of the words “One-way-travel-time” in the marking required by this paragraph.  
(1) OWTT is based on the marked rated holding time (MRHT) of the cargo tank for the cryogenic liquid to be transported in the cargo tank. If the MRHT for the flammable cryogenic liquid is not displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate, this MRHT may be derived.  

(2) The MRHT is converted to OWTT, in hours, as follows:  
(i) For a tank with an MRHT of 72 hours or less,  OWTT = (MRHT − 24) / 2  

(ii) For a tank with an MRHT greater than 72 hours,  OWTT = MRHT − 48  

(3) Each cargo tank motor vehicle used to transport a flammable cryogenic liquid must be examined after each shipment to determine its actual holding time. The record required by § 177.840(h) of this subchapter may be used for this determination. If the examination indicates that the actual holding time of the cargo tank, after adjustment to reflect an average ambient temperature of 85 °F, is less than 90 percent of the marked rated holding time (MRHT) for the cryogenic liquid marked on the specification plate or adjacent thereto (see § 178.338–18(b) of this subchapter), the tank may not be refilled with any flammable cryogenic liquid until it is restored to its marked rated holding time value or it is re-marked with the actual marked rated holding time determined by this examination. If the name of the flammable cryogenic liquid that was transported and its marked rated holding time is not displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate, this requirement may be met by deriving the MRHT of the cargo tank for that flammable cryogenic liquid and comparing that derived MRHT with the actual holding time after adjustment.

(2) Thermal integrity test.  When required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, either of the following thermal integrity tests may be used:  
(i) Pressure rise test.  The pressure rise in the tank may not exceed 0.34 Bar (5 psig) in 24 hours. When the pressure rise test is performed, the absolute pressure in the annular space of the loaded tank car may not exceed 75 microns of mercury at the beginning of the test and may not increase more than 25 microns during the 24-hour period; or  

(ii) Calculated heat transfer rate test.  The insulation system must be performance tested as prescribed in § 179.400–4 of this subchapter. When the calculated heat transfer rate test is performed, the absolute pressure in the annular space of the loaded tank car may not exceed 75 microns of mercury at the beginning of the test and may not increase more than 25 microns during the 24-hour period. The calculated heat transfer rate in 24 hours may not exceed:  
(A) 120 percent of the appropriate standard heat transfer rate specified in § 179.401–1 of this subchapter, for DOT-113A60W and DOT-113C120W tank cars;  

(B) 122.808 joules (0.1164 Btu/day/lb.) of inner tank car water capacity, for DOT-113A175W tank cars;  

(C) 345.215 joules (0.3272 Btu/day/lb.) of inner tank car water capacity, for DOT-113C60W and 113D60W tank cars; or
