The candidate’s work will be carried out in part at I3mainz in Germany and in part at the Le2i in France.His research will be within I3mainz’s WiDOP project which benefits from a three-year funding support (~ 27 000 EUR per year for this position) granted by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany). WiDOP (Wissensbasierte Detektion von Objekten in Punktwolken für Anwendungen im Ingenieurbereich), which stands for “Knowledge-based detection of objects in 3D point clouds for engineering applications”, is an ambitious project aiming to devise and develop efficient intelligent methods capable of achieving an automated processing of terrestrial laser scanner data.This project contrasts with existing ones in that it uses prior knowledge as basis for a selective, object-oriented detection, identification and modeling of objects present in the point cloud. This knowledge can be obtained from various sources such as databases, construction plans, as-built plans or Geographic Information Systems. Within WiDOP, the successful candidate will work on knowledge-based numerical processing of 3D point clouds.The goal is to develop and implement intelligent methods capable of achieving an automated processing, detection, identification and modeling of objects from terrestrial laser scanner data.
