Key Ingredients









Hyaluronic Acid 
Hyaluronic Acid is a sugar molecule that occurs naturally in the skin and helps bind water to collagen. It is able to hold up to 1,000 times its molecular weight in water to retain all that moisture in our skin, but also prevents all that moisture from evaporating into the air. Hyaluronic Acid will instantly hydrate your skin and under eye area for a plumper and smoother look with less fine lines and dry patches.







Goji Berries
Goji berries, also known as wolfberries, are small red berries native to Asia. Goji berries were used in ancient Chinese medicine for thousands of years to treat a variety of health issues. The most exciting thing about Goji berries when it comes to skin care is, it's known anti-aging benefits and its ability to help maintain healthy, youthful skin. Goji berries contain 11 of the 22 essential dietary trace minerals, amino acids, high levels of vitamin C, flavonoids, and packed with antioxidants to help improve the look of fine lines and wrinkles, dark circles, and puffiness around the eye area.







Apple Stem Cells
Apple stem cells boost production of human stem cells, protect the cells from stress, and even help to decrease signs of aging. When delivered into the skin, these stem cells provide notable results in blurring lines, wrinkles, and environmental damage.

It worked so well that I started using it around my lips. That worked so well that I used it on my forehead crease (in between eyebrows) It really works!! I’m ordering more when this runs out.RebeccaI'm 27 and don't have any signs of aging. But I wanted to start on an eye cream mostly for prevention. This prodcut has so many clean ingredients and does just that. Exactly what I needed.	DJ FamI have only just received the eye cream, but so far I am loving this product! It feels amazing on my skin. Goes on silky smooth, leaving an every so slight tingling/cooling feeling for a few seconds. I hope things continue down this path. I am excited to continue using it!LivLove the packaging, the smell, and the texture. I love using this eye cream.MeghanYou can instantly feel the hyaluronic acid working. You feel the instant hydration and rejuvination.

Ayda DThis eye cream has very nice and chic packaging and comes in a small container that contains of 0.5 fl. oz of product which is pretty small size but compared to the price, I can think it's okay as normally eye creams are way more expensive. This eye cream is very effective on fine lines and I love using it in the morning under my concealer and also at night before go to bed.Paul MThe Kalaia Preserve & Restore is a lightweight white cream that is provided in a cute half-ounce jar. Its mostly botanical ingredients include shea butter at the top of the list and sodium hyaluronate, a relative of hyaluronic acid, at the bottom of the list. The cream spreads well. It is readily absorbed, leaving a nice moisturization without any stickiness, Very good.Huck78I'm a guy. I didn't have a daily routine......until now. So my wife bought this and me being a typical husband I was teasing her about aging. As part of teasing her I put some on the *ahem* fine lines around my own eyes. At this point I am actually looking at my skin and my eyes and notice that I may not be as young as I once was. The next day I felt like I saw subtle changes but my better half explained to me that results dont happen overnight and I would need to use it for a few weeks. Well a few weeks go by and my wife asks me where her eye cream is. I explained that she doesnt have any eye cream but she is welcome to use my eye cream and its a part of my daily routine. After she stopped laughing about me having a daily routine she took a close look (let's face it, we never look at our spouse that closely) and was impressed by the results. Needless to say, we both use this as a part of our daily routine now.

I never write reviews but I'm pretty impressed with the product and needed to share it with someone but I haven't worked up the nerve to tell my friends I have a daily routine let alone what I have in it.	Cindy JenkinsAs I’ve aged the bags and wrinkles around my eyes have become significantly worse. I LOVE that this product has helped to reduce those lines and reverse the aging process on my face. I plan to keep using it and recommend it to all my “aging” friends. Thanks kalaia.ACBest eye cream I've ever used. This has helped me with my under eye circles and wrinkles a lot.

I even keep it with and use it at my desk at work. I’ve tried so many eye creams and this is by far the best!SaraEye creams are always hard because they take long to show results and most don't even make a difference. This one was different. I started noticing changes within 2-3 weeks. Love the smell and the texture of it.Lisa R Seasonal allergies leave dark circles from the constant rubbing of my eyes.  The Preserve and Restore eye cream does just that, it preserves and restore around my eyes keeping the area even with the rest of my face.

Been using it for several weeks now and there’s a difference, a good difference!Christina W.Your Eyes will thank you. As someone in my early 30s I didn't think I needed an eye cream.

Daily use of Kalaia’s Deluxe set coupled with the eye cream has resulted in smooth even toned brighter skin. Joanne Myers6 weeks using Preserve & Restore 
My skin feels and looks tighter under my eyes. The color doesn’t look as red and the fine lines seem smaller. My lids have lost that “fold” and seem less puffy. And the vertical lines between my brows have diminished!
