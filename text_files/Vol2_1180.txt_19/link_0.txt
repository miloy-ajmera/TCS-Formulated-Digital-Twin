What it is



                            A lightweight eye cream powered by new multi-action Super Lotus to depuff and smooth the delicate eye area for a radiant, resilient, youthful look.
                        



Why you need it



                            Our beloved eye cream, now with multi-action Super Lotus, addresses first signs of aging by boosting radiance, strengthening the eye area, and minimizing the appearance of puffiness. We also added horse chestnut flower extract to
specifically target and smooth the look of fine lines around the eyes

F.A.Q.





Why do I need specific eye treatments?
The skin around the eyes is thinner and more delicate than the rest of the face—and one of the first areas to show signs of aging—so it needs to be protected and treated with special care. Blinking, squinting, eye rubbing, and removing makeup along with fatigue, dehydration, allergies, and stress can lead to puffiness, fine lines, crow’s feet, dullness, and a loss of elasticity and moisture.
Do I apply eye cream before or after moisturizer?
Eye cream should be applied before moisturizer, but after you’ve cleansed, toned, and applied serum to your skin. Here’s why: Our eye creams are formulated with powerful ingredients that specifically target the eye area, and to reap their benefits, they need to penetrate the skin. Since eye creams are generally thinner than moisturizers, applying your eye cream first will allow it to fully absorb without any barriers.
If I use an eye serum, do I still need an eye cream?
Yes. While eye serums are concentrated with key ingredients to tackle specific eye-area concerns, an eye cream seals everything in and keeps skin hydrated and protected.
