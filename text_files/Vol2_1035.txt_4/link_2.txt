Description




Glycerol Monostearate (e471) is an emulsifying agent that helps fat and water stay together. It prevents the formation of fat bloom on confectionery and truffles. It is applicable to all types of products with water content, and it is particularly recommended for use in water-fat mixtures. It prevents ice creams from drying out or being too sweet.
