Last Updateï¼2022-01-01 10:57:23Imidazolidinyl Urea - Reference InformationLogP0.9 at 20âEPA chemical information  Information provided by: ofmpub.epa.gov (external link) Preservative  Imidazolidinyl urea is a kind of preservative in cosmetics. It has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and can inhibit Gram-negative and positive bacteria. It has a certain inhibitory effect on yeast and mold. It is mainly used to inhibit the reproduction of microorganisms and can be compatible with various components in cosmetics, the test results show that its antibacterial ability is not affected by surfactants, proteins and other special additives in cosmetics.  application: imidazolidinyl urea can be used in cream, shampoo, dew, conditioner and other products, can be used alone, can also be used with nipagin esters, IPBC, etc., to enhance its anti-corrosion effect. The use range of pH value is 3~9, the general addition amount is 0.2 ~ 0.4%, and the maximum allowable addition amount is 0.6%, which can be added in a wide temperature range (<90 â).  Usually imidazolidinyl urea and nipagin ester or Kesson CG cooperate with cosmetic preservatives. It can be used for cream, milk, shampoo, etc. It is especially suitable for some advanced nutritional cosmetics that are easy to be infected with copper green choriobacteria when the ph value is alkaline. The usual dosage is 0.1% ~ 0.5%. However, because imidazolidinyl urea has a irritating effect on the skin of some people, it is easy to cause allergies. At present, it is no longer used in some high-end cosmetics.  use  imidazolidinyl urea is a new generation of cosmetic preservative. it is used in the cosmetic industry and is the most widely used preservative except nipagin ester. it has a wide antibacterial spectrum and can be compatible with almost all cosmetic raw materials. the use concentration is 0.05% ~ 0.5%, and the most suitable pH3 ~ 9. it can be added at any stage of cosmetic manufacturing, combined with nipagin ester shows synergistic effect. In the mid-60s, Germall 115 was first synthesized in the Sutton laboratory, and then Germall II was synthesized in 1981. The antibacterial effect is better than that of Germall 115. It is particularly effective against Pseudomonas, bacteria, molds, and yeasts. It is also effective. It is widely used in cream, lotion, shampoo and some cosmetics that are difficult to preserve. It can also be used as a preservative for food and medicine.  Used for biological research on the antibacterial synergistic activity of essential oils and surfactants for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus; used to shift energy metabolism from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, nutrient activation, Pharmacological research of drug shielding effect; used for local delivery of active molecules, including plant-based nanostructured carriers; used as a local prescription for antioxidants; used in preventive analysis and research, A comparative study of MEKC and microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography; the study of apoptosis and necrosis induced in vitro due to the widely used prevention method.  production method  imidazolidinyl urea is generally composed of alkyl imidazole derivatives such as allantoin (allantoin) and formaldehyde in alkaline medium reaction, control different process conditions to obtain Germall 115 or Germall II.
