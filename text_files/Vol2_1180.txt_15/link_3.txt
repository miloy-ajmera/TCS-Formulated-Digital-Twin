Under the Radar: Dermonectin Eye Cream
 by Kimberly Yang  | 0 comments



 
WHO: Dermonectin Eye Cream, for combination/dry and dry skin types.
WHAT: Azulene, Beeswax, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, Peanut Oil, Seaweed, Vegetable Oil
WHY: Dermonectin Eye Cream is an incredibly concentrated eye treatment designed specifically for very dry skin around the eyes. Azulene and Seaweed help soothe and nourish the delicate under-eye while a rich blend of Coconut, Peanut, and Vegetable Oils help provide intense hydration throughout the day.
HOW: Pat a small amount of cream along the orbital bone from the innermost corner outwards, and take the excess over the lids and outward. Use twice daily for best results.

I hold these truths to be self-evident, that skin care is paramount, green tea is everything, and the Internet rules all (typical Gen-Y philosophy; if it wasn't 'grammed, it never happened).
