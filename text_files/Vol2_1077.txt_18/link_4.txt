Vitamin E acetate by ATAMAN Kimya is often used in dermatological products such as skin creams. 


Vitamin E acetate is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol. 


Vitamin E acetate is used as an alternative to tocopherol itself because the phenolic hydroxyl group is blocked, providing a less acidic product with a longer shelf life. 


It is believed that the acetate is slowly hydrolyzed after it is absorbed into the skin, regenerating tocopherol and providing protection against the sun's ultraviolet rays.


Vitamin E acetate was first synthesized in 1963 by workers at Hoffmann-La Roche.






Although there is widespread use of tocopheryl acetate as a topical medication, with claims for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue, reviews have repeatedly concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims.


There are reports of vitamin E-induced allergic contact dermatitis from use of vitamin E derivatives such as tocopheryl linoleate and tocopherol acetate in skin care products. 


Incidence is low despite widespread use.






Alpha-tocopheryl acetate (ATA) is a specific form of vitamin E that’s often found in skin care products and dietary supplements. 


It’s also known as tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol acetate, or vitamin E acetate.










Vitamin E Acetate is an active ingredient for use in cosmetic products for the skin and the hair.


As an in-vivo antioxidant, Vitamin E Acetate protects the cells against free radicals and prevents the peroxidation of body fats. 


Vitamin E Acetate is also an effective moisturizing agent and improves the elasticity and smoothness of the skin, and is particularly suitable for use in sun-protection products and products for daily personal care. 


Vitamin E Acetate is supplied in a light yellow, viscous oil, has practically no odor, and is miscible with hydrocarbons, alcohols, fats and oils; and insoluble in water.






Tocopheryl Acetate is VITAMIN E-ACETATE CARE by ATAMAN KIMYA is a vitamin-based, antioxidant. 


VITAMIN E-ACETATE is used in sun care (after-sun, self tanning, sun protection), baby care & cleansing, body-, color and face care products. 


VITAMIN E-ACETATE is also used in conditioning, face cleansing, personal care wipes and toothpaste/mouthwash.














Chemistry


At room temperature, Vitamin E acetate is a fat-soluble liquid. It has 3 chiral centers and thus 8 stereoisomers. 


Vitamin E acetate is made by esterifying α-tocopherol with acetic acid. 


2R,4R,8R-isomer, also known as RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate, is the most common isomer used for various purposes. 


This is because α-tocopherol occurs in the nature primarily as RRR-α-tocopherol.






Vitamin E acetate does not boil at atmospheric pressure and begins to degrade at 240 °C.


It can be vacuum distilled: it boils at 184 °C at 0.01 mmHg, at 194 °C (0.025 mmHg) and at 224 °C (0.3 mmHg). 


In practice, Vitamin E acetate is not degraded notably by air, visible light or UV-radiation.


Vitamin E acetate has a refractive index of 1.4950–1.4972 at 20 °C.


Vitamin E acetate (α-Tocopherol acetate) is hydrolyzed to α-tocopherol and acetic acid under suitable conditions or when ingested by people.

Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties. Antioxidants help to protect your body from damaging compounds called free radicals. 


Normally, free radicals form when your body converts food into energy. 


However, free radicals can also come from UV light, cigarette smoke, and air pollution.






In nature, vitamin E comes in the form of tocopheryl or tocotrienol. 


Both tocopheryl and tocotrienol have four forms, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. 


Alpha-tocopheryl (AT) is the most active form of vitamin E in humans.






Vitamin E acetate is more stable than AT, meaning it can better withstand environmental stresses such as heat, air, and light. 


This makes it ideal for use in supplements and fortified foods because it has a longer shelf life.










Cosmetics and supplements


Vitamin E acetate is found in a variety of skin care products. 


The antioxidant properties of vitamin E can help to prevent damage to skin caused by free radicals from UV exposure. 


Vitamin E may also have an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin.






Due to its higher stability, Vitamin E acetate is also used in vitamin E dietary supplements. 


When taken orally, Vitamin E acetate is converted to Alpha-tocopheryl within the intestine. 


Vitamin E is in most multi-vitamins, so be sure to check how much is in your multi-vitamin if you take one, before adding a supplement.










Foods


In addition to dietary supplements and cosmetic products, vitamin E is found in the following foods:






green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach


oils, such as sunflower oil, wheat germ oil, and corn oil


sunflower seeds


nuts, such as almonds and peanuts


whole grains


fruits, such as kiwi and mango


Vitamin E is also added to fortified foods, such as cereals, fruit juices, and many spreads. 














Alpha-Tocopherol acetate is a form of vitamin E that’s often included in cosmetic products and dietary supplements due to its higher stability compared to Alpha-Tocopherol. 


When taken orally, Alpha-Tocopherol acetate is converted into active Alpha-tocopheryl within the body. 


The effectiveness of Alpha-Tocopherol acetate in cosmetic products seems to be limited because Alpha-Tocopherol acetate isn’t effectively broken down to Alpha-tocopheryl in the upper layers of skin. 


Additionally, research on the benefits of Alpha-Tocopherol acetate supplements is limited and the results are mixed at best.










Tocopheryl acetate is a specific type of vitamin E, in a class of organic chemical compounds known as tocopherols. 


These compounds are considered fat-soluble antioxidants, but are also said to have many other functions in the body. 














The antioxidants in vitamin E are known to protect the cell from damage that naturally occurs from free radicals. 


These free radicals are formed in the body during normal processes (such as energy production). 


Other free radicals come from various sources, like radiation from X-rays, air pollution, smoking, and industrial chemicals. 


So, vitamin E (tocopheryl acetate) goes to work acting as an antioxidant to protect the cells and DNA, promoting cellular health. 


Because vitamin E is fat-soluble, this means that it can stop the production of free radicals formed when the body breaks down fat for energy.










Note, there are eight different types of natural vitamin E; alpha tocopherol is the most abundant type in human tissue. 


It is the only variation of vitamin E used to treat vitamin E deficiencies.






Tocopheryl acetate is commonly used to formulate dietary supplements as well as skin care products.






Tocopheryl acetate (Alpha-tocopheryl acetate) is also known as:






Alpha tocopheryl acetate (ATA)


Vitamin E acetate


Tocopherol acetate


A-tocopherol


Alpha tocopherol


D-alpha tocopherol














Vitamin E is a vitamin that dissolves in fat. It is found in many foods including vegetable oils, cereals, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and wheat germ oil. It is also available as a supplement.






Vitamin E is used for treating vitamin E deficiency, which is rare, but can occur in people with certain genetic disorders and in very low-weight premature infants.






Some people use vitamin E for treating and preventing diseases of the heart and blood vessels including hardening of the arteries, heart attack, chest pain, stroke, irregular heart beat (atrial fibrillation), heart failure, leg pain due to blocked arteries, and high blood pressure.






Vitamin E is also used for treating diabetes and its complications, liver disease, kidney disease, Peyronie's disease (painful erection in men), and enlarged prostate (BPH). 


It is used for preventing cancer, particularly lung and oral cancer in smokers; colorectal cancer and polyps; and gastric, skin, bladder, breast, head and neck, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Vitamin E is also used decrease side effects of chemotherapy.






Some people use vitamin E for diseases of the brain and nervous system including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, night cramps, restless leg syndrome, and for epilepsy, along with other medications. 


Vitamin E is also used for Huntington's chorea, and other disorders involving nerves and muscles.






Women use vitamin E for preventing complications in late pregnancy due to high blood pressure (pre-eclampsia), for preventing preterm labor, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), benign breast disease, weak bones (osteoporosis), painful periods, menopausal syndrome, hot flashes associated with breast cancer, and breast cysts.






Sometimes vitamin E is used to lessen the harmful effects of medical treatments such as dialysis and radiation. 


It is also used to reduce unwanted side effects of drugs such as hair loss in people taking doxorubicin and lung damage in people taking amiodarone.






Vitamin E is sometimes used for improving physical endurance, increasing energy, reducing muscle damage after exercise, and improving muscle strength.






Vitamin E is also used for cataracts, age-related vision loss (age-related macular degeneration), asthma, respiratory infections, skin disorders, aging skin, sunburns, cystic fibrosis, infertility, impotence, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), neurodegenerative disease called Lou Gherig's disease (ALS), leg cramps, peptic ulcers, H pylori, swelling in the middle layer of the eye (uveitis), mouth sores (oral mucosal lesions), movement and coordination disorder called dyspraxia, kidney problems in children (glomerulosclerosis), movement disorder (ataxia) associated with vitamin E deficiency (AVED), rheumatoid arthritis, for certain inherited diseases and to prevent allergies. 










Some people apply vitamin E to their skin to keep it from aging, sunburn, scarring, lice, stretch marks, and to protect against the skin effects of chemicals used for cancer therapy (chemotherapy).






The American Heart Association recommends obtaining antioxidants, including vitamin E, by eating a well-balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rather than from supplements until more is known about the risks and benefits of taking supplements.






The most widely used active ingredient in the beauty industry, Vitamin E has proven antioxidant effects, enhances moisturization and strengthens the skin barrier. 


Vitamin E helps to counteract the appearance of inflammation linked to oxidative processes through downregulation of its mediators. 


As one of the most powerful oil-soluble antioxidants and free-radical scavengers available today, Vitamin E plays a crucial role in oxidative regeneration of skin exposed to stressors. 










Vitamin E is available in several natural and synthetic forms for the personal care application:


The Vitamin E acetate forms, d-α-Tocopheryl Acetate and dl-α-Tocopheryl Acetate, are extremely stable in formulations and therefore the compounds of choice for cosmetic preparations with maximum vitamin efficacy. 


The tocopherol forms dl-α -Tocopherol and Mixed Tocopherols are mostly used to stabilize oxygen-sensitive ingredients in cosmetic formulations, to enhance the shelf-life of the formulation










Benefits of Vitamin E :


Vitamin E helps to protect beautiful and healthy-looking skin. 


Vitamin E helps improving skin resilience induced by damages from urban pollutants. 


Vitamin E helps to enhance skin sensation by soothing. 


Vitamin E helps in skin softening & improves appearance of skin with acne and blemishes. 


Vitamin E significantly strengthens the skin barrier, even with rinse-off products containing α-tocopherol in concentrations of less than 0.2%. 






The protecting effects of Vitamin E are manifold and reported in many publications. 


But its central role is that of a strong antioxidant, capturing free oxygen radicals generated by exposure to UV-light or pollution and preventing damages.










Alpha-Tocopherol acetate is an active ingredient for use in cosmetic products for the skin and the hair. 


As an in-vivo antioxidant, alpha-Tocopherol acetate protects the cells against free radicals and prevents the peroxidation of body fats. 


Alpha-Tocopherol acetate is also an effective moisturizing agent and improves the elasticity and smoothness of the skin. 


Alpha-Tocopherol acetate is particularly suitable for use in sun-protection products and products for daily personal care.






Tocopherol acetate is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol and provides beneficial antioxidant effects.
