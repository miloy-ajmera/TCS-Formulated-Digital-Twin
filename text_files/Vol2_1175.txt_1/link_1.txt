Storage Conditions:
Lanolin may gradually undergo autoxidation during storage. To
inhibit this process, the inclusion of butylated hydroxytoluene is
permitted as an antioxidant. Exposure to excessive or prolonged
heating may cause anhydrous lanolin to darken in color and
develop a strong rancidlike odor. However, lanolin may be sterilized
by dry heat at 150°C. Ophthalmic ointments containing lanolin
may be sterilized by filtration or by exposure to gamma irradiation.


Odor:
Slight odor or practically odorless
