The mixing of pollen oils into honeycomb wax turns the white wax into a yellow or brown color. Beeswax is used for high cholesterol, pain, fungal skin infections, and other conditions. But there is no good scientific research to support these uses.  In foods and beverages, white beeswax and beeswax absolute (yellow beeswax treated with alcohol) are used as stiffening agents. In manufacturing, yellow and white beeswax are used as thickeners, emulsifiers, and as stiffening agents in cosmetics. Beeswax absolute is used as a fragrance in soaps and perfumes. White beeswax and beeswax absolute are also used to polish pills.  How does it work ? Beeswax might help lower cholesterol levels, prevent infections, and help protect the stomach from ulcers caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Uses & Effectiveness  ?  Insufficient Evidence for  Small tears in the lining of the anus (anal fissures). Early research shows that applying a mixture of beeswax, honey, and olive oil to the affected area for 12 hours reduces pain, bleeding, and itching due to anal fissures. Burns. Early research shows that applying a gauze with a mixture of beeswax, olive oil, and alkanna to second-degree burns speeds up healing and shortens the time spent in the hospital. Other early research shows that using a particular beeswax cream can decrease itching that occurs when a burn is healing.  Diaper rash. Early research shows that applying a mixture of beeswax, honey, and olive oil to the affected area four times daily for 7 days reduces symptoms of diaper rash.  Hemorrhoids. Early research shows that applying a mixture of beeswax, honey, and olive oil to the affected area for 12 hours reduces pain, bleeding, and itching due to hemorrhoids. Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Early research shows that applying a mixture of honey, olive oil-propolis extract, and beeswax to mouth sores caused by cancer treatment helps speed up recovery time in people with severe ulcers. But it may not work as well in people with moderate ulcers. Also, applying honey by itself may work better than the beeswax mixture.  Ringworm (Tinea corporis). Early research shows that applying a mixture of beeswax, honey, and olive oil to the affected area three times daily for 4 weeks improves ringworm. Jock itch (tinea cruris). Early research shows that applying a mixture of beeswax, honey, and olive oil to the affected area three times daily for 4 weeks improves jock itch. A common fungal infection of the skin (Tinea versicolor). Early research shows that applying a mixture of beeswax, honey, and olive oil to the affected area three times daily for 4 weeks improves a fungal skin infection called tinea versicolor. Diarrhea. Hiccups. High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Pain. Stomach ulcers. Other conditions. More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of beeswax for these uses. Side Effects When taken by mouth: Beeswax is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth as food or as a medicine. While rare, some people may have an allergic reaction to beeswax. When applied to the skin: Beeswax is LIKELY SAFE for most people when applied directly to the skin. While rare, some people may have an allergic skin rash after applying beeswax.  Special Precautions  and Warnings When taken by mouth: Beeswax is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth as food or as a medicine. While rare, some people may have an allergic reaction to beeswax. When applied to the skin: Beeswax is LIKELY SAFE for most people when applied directly to the skin. While rare, some people may have an allergic skin rash after applying beeswax.  Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if beeswax is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Interactions  ?  We currently have no information for BEESWAX overview.  Dosing The appropriate dose of beeswax depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for beeswax. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using. Next  View References  REFERENCES:  Al-Waili, N. S.
