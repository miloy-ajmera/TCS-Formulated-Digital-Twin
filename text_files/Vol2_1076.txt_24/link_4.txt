You want the water to be at a gentle simmer not boiling. Sirl the contents of the jar every so often to help everything mix together well.  As soon as the ingredients are melted and combined remove the jar from the water.  Pour the mixture in a small mixing bowl and let it cool for 5 minutes before stirring in the Essential Oils.
