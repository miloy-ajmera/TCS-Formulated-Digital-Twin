E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is a nonionic surfactant. 
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is variously used as a dispersing agent, emulsifier, and stabilizer, in food and in aerosol sprays. 
Brand names for polysorbates include Alkest, Canarcel, and Span. 
The consistency of E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is waxy
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate)'s color is light cream to tan.
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) (abbreviation STS) is also known as Span 65
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is a nonionic surfactant that can be used as an emulsifier and stabilizer in food with the European food additive number E492. 
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate)'s main functions are to retard fat bloom in chocolates and prevent cloudy appearance in cooking oils.
How is E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) made?
Like sorbitan monostearate, this ingredient is also made from direct esterification of sorbitol with stearic acid, but different from the former, as with three stearic acid molecules attached to sorbitan molecule in the structure. 
The final product is not a pure compound but a mixture of the partial esters of sorbitol and its anhydrides with edible stearic acid.  
Specification:
Other names: 
-Sorbitan esters of fatty acids
-Sorbitan esters
-Sorbitan trioctadecanoate
-AnhydroE492 (Sorbitan Tristearate)
Appearance: A light cream to tan beads or flakes or hard, waxy solid with a slight odour
HLB: 2.1 (1)
Solubility: Not soluble in water; insoluble in methanol and ethanol; dispersible in mineral oil and vegetable oils
What’re the Uses of E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate)?
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is used as a water in oil (W/O) emulsifier and when used in combination with polysorbates they can stabilize oil in water (O/W) emulsions. 
The formulation of the Span/Polysorbate ratio can produce emulsifying systems with various HLB values. 
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is mainly used as an anti-bloom agent of fat, and also maintains the color and gloss in chocolates.
When used in margarine, shortenings and cooking oils, its purpose is to keep an appealing texture.
The following food list may contain it:
-Bakery products
-Toppings and coatings
-Fat emulsions (e.g. spreads)
-Beverage whiteners
-Desserts 
-Jam, jellies and marmalades
-Cocoa and chocolate products
-Candies
*Chocolates:
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) and lecithin are often used as surface-active substances to reduce viscosity in chocolate formulations. 
In chocolate, E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) adjusts sugar crystallization and appearance
Also E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) can reduce stickiness.
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is used as an emulsifier that can be used to retard fat bloom by preventing β’ crystals from converting to β crystals when exposed to excessive heat conditions, which tend to migrate to the chocolate surface and thus cause fat bloom. 
At the same time, E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) results in a negative influence on the appearance of the chocolate.  
β’ crystals are unstable crystals formed by cocoa powder, which is an important ingredient in the manufacturing of chocolate.
*Cooking Oils:
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) can be used as an anti-crystallization agent in cooking oils (e.g. palm oil, coconut oil) to prevent oils cloudy appearance which are formed by harden-fast fractions under colder temperatures. 
*Cosmetics:
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) functions as a surfactant in cosmetics and personal care products. 
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate)'s concentrations typically range between 0.1% and 5% (up to 10%).
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) may be present in the following products: 
-Skin care products
-Makeup products
-Moisturizers 
Is it Halal, Kosher and Vegan?
Yes, E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) would be halal, kosher and vegan if the raw material – stearic acid is from natural vegetable oils. 
However, some manufacturing processes may use stearic acid from animal fats and oils.
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is a component often used in CBR and CBS applications to stabilize β′ crystals
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is produced by the esterification of Sorbitol with commercial edible fatty acids and consists of approximately 95% of a mixture of the esters of Sorbitol and its mono and di-anhydrides.
This food additive is light cream to tan coloured, hard, waxy solid with a slight characteristic odour and bland taste.
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is an effective emulsifier to retard fat bloom in chocolate. 
Fat used in chocolate, particularly cocoa butter, forms as a tightly packed β’ polymorph/crystal which is an unstable crystal but is vital for the functional and aesthetic quality of chocolate. 
E492 (Sorbitan Tristearate) is used as a crystal inhibitor in oils which contain fractions that harden faster during colder temperatures making the oils look cloudy.
