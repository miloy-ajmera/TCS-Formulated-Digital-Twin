8 Surprising Benefits of Calendula Oil on Your Skin



We all want smooth, clear, and youthful skin because this enhances our beauty and youthfulness. However, not everyone has effortlessly beautiful skin. Fortunately, there are skincare ingredients that promote healthy, radiant skin. In this article, we will be discussing a particular not-so-well-known skincare ingredient called calendula oil. Let's find out more about the calendula oil benefits to your skin.
What is Calendula oil?Â 
Calendula, or Calendula Officinalis, is the marigold plant. It is a member of the Asteraceae/Compositae family along with chamomile, daisies, sunflowers, chrysanthemums, dandelions, goldenrod, coneflowers, thistles, artichokes, and dahlias.Â Â 
The Calendula flower is orange or yellow, edible, and loaded with a variety of skin benefits. Calendula oil is made by soaking the flowers in a carrier oil (such as olive oil, jojoba oil, or coconut oil). The oil can be used on its own or as an ingredient in ointments, balms, creams, or lotions. It can also be produced in tincture, tea, or capsule form.Â 
The active ingredients of the calendula flower are naturally occurring chemicals, such as triterpene saponins (oleanolic acid glycosides), triterpene alcohols (Î±-, Î²-amyrins, faradiol), and flavonoids (quercetin and isorhamnetin). The sun-protective effect of topical gel formulations of Calendula is thought to be associated with improving collagen synthesis in the skin.
Eight Benefits of Calendula Oil
Calendula oil offers a variety of benefits that can help you achieve flawless and radiant skin. Here are some calendula oil benefits that you should know about:

 Oxidative Stress Protection
 Anti-inflammatory properties
 Anesthetic properties
 Anti-aging properties
 Wound healing
 Scalp treatment
 Sun protection
 Increases skin firmness

Oxidative Stress Protection
Calendula oil contains a high amount of antioxidants that can help eliminate oxidative stress in the skin. When there is an accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the body, oxidative stress can damage the cells and cause inflammation. Antioxidants in Calendula oil quench the free radicals by reacting with the reactive oxygen species instead of the cells, protecting the cells from damage and inflammation. By applying Calendula oil to the skin or using skincare products containing Calendula oil, your skin will be more healthy and less prone to irritation.

Anti-inflammatory properties
Calendula oil also has a good track record of calming inflammation in the skin. You can apply Calendula oil to the skin to relieve itching and discomfort. When applied to the joints and muscles, it can also reduce pain from sprains or strains. Skincare products containing Calendula oil may benefit persons with inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis.Â 
Analgesic Properties
Calendula oil can help reduce pain and discomfort. This analgesic property is independent of the opioid pathway, so this avenue is being explored more in the health community to minimize the prescription of narcotics. Don't be surprised if your analgesic cream contains Calendula oil. Applying the oil to the skin is also very soothing.
Anti-Aging Benefits
Are you or someone you know experiencing accelerated skin aging related to stress or illness? You may need to add Calendula oil to your skincare routine. As found in Revive & Repair anti-aging creme, Calendula oil helps slow down the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and other signs of skin aging. Adding this oil to your skin regimen also boosts skin hydration and helps to promote clear, youthful, glowing skin.Â 
Heals damaged skin.
Not everyone enjoys clear and glowing skin, as stated earlier, and one of the reasons is not using the best skincare products for your skin type. Or applying too many ingredients to the skin. Have you seen the 10-step or 15-step skincare routine making the rounds on social media? Too much of anything can be bad for your skin. Incorporating Calendula oil makes sense because it performs several functions that replace many other ingredients, reducing the need for multiple components on the skin.Â 
It also possesses properties that help your skin heal faster from irritation or injuries.Â 
Scalp Treatment
Discussions about the skin should not exclude the skin beneath our hair, the scalp. Calendula oil is an excellent scalp moisturizer. It also has antibacterial and antifungal properties, making it suitable to treat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. It also helps hydrate the scalp and helps reduce itching. But it does one more thing: it can promote hair growth by reducing inflammation of the scalp. Despite scalp treatment falling under hair care, calendula oil benefits extend to the scalp.
Functions As Sunscreen
Every dermatologist agrees on one thing: sun protection! Sunscreen functions as an extra layer of protection for the body by reflecting away or absorbing harmful ultra-violet rays of the sun. Calendula oil has some sun-protecting properties. In a study, Calendula oil was found to have an equivalent of SPF 14. You should definitely shoot for SPF 30 in your sunscreen and reapply every 2 hours if you are out in the sun.Â 
Increases skin firmness.
Calendula oil provides some short-term benefits for your skin, and one of them is keeping the skin firm. Calendula oil also makes your skin more hydrated and supple.Â 
Frequently Asked Questions
How Should I Use Calendula Oil?
You can use calendula oil just like any essential oil. Mix it carefully with a carrier oil. Some quality carrier oils that you can consider mixing calendula oil with are coconut and jojoba oils. Massage the mixture into the skin. However, you can also enjoy the maximum benefits of Calendula oil in skincare products formulated with calendula oil.
What Are the Side Effects?
There aren't many side effects associated with the appropriate use of calendula oil on the skin. Still, some situations might warrant avoiding it. For instance, you should not use Calendula oil if you have allergies to marigolds, daisies, or another related flower. Also, pregnant women and nursing mothers are advised to stay away from calendula oil. Visit a board-certified dermatologist for some skincare recommendations.
Can I be allergic to Calendula oil?
Calendula is often cross-reactive with ragweed, feverfew, chamomile, or Echinacea, so people with these allergies should be careful.Â 
How Should I Store Calendula Oil?
Calendula oil is best stored in a cool, dark place and out of reach of children. You will prolong the shelf-life and effectiveness of calendula oil by storing it properly.Â 
How Often Should I Apply Calendula Oil?
You may apply the calendula oil mixture twice a day. However, if you are treating a specific skin condition, you should follow the instructions of your skin doctor.Â 
Does The Scalp Also Count as Skin?
The scalp is also a skin surface, albeit modified skin. Calendula oil also offers benefits for the scalp.Â 
Conclusion
You are not alone if you have underestimated the calendula oil benefits or haven't heard about it before. Your skin is one of the most critical organs of your body, and it requires proper care. Calendula oil is one of the best skincare ingredients you can use to maintain your skin's health. You are not too far from achieving the healthy skin you desire, so put in the effort. If you decide to use this oil for your skin, please let us know what you think after using it, along with any changes you notice.
