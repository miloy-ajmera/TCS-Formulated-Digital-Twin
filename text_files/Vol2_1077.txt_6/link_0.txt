The skin around our eyes is an incredibly delicate region. Although, keeping this area hydrated without exposing it to pesky excess chemicals is a tricky task.
Luckily, Indie Lee, founder of the eco-chic, all-natural skincare line, found a wonderful ingredient that helps soothe our under eyes without abrasion: calendula.
OROGOLD 24K Gold Anti-Aging Eye Serum helps to firm the delicate skin around the eyes and reduce the appearance of crow’s feet. Read more about it/SEE PHOTOS —> HERE!
The Indie Lee Calendula Eye Balm ($42.00) contains calendula oil, which is known to help strengthen skin with anti-aging and anti-inflammatory benefits.

According to the Indie Lee team, “A natural anti-inflammatory, the oil helps to reduce swelling while its reparative qualities aid in battling dark circles and fine lines. Perfect for sensitive skin, calendula is so gentle, Indie even uses it in her Baby Balm.”

Additionally, this eye balm contains moisturizing mango seed butter, calming lavender and squalane oil.
Amarté Cosmetics EyeConic® Eye Cream contains an amazing 3.8% stabilized retinol in a gentle and elegant formulation. See what our writer Yona thought of it —> HERE!
The directions state to use ring finger or skincare spatula to scoop out a grain-sized amount of product. Let the balm momentarily warm, then gently dab around the orbital bone twice daily.
Before

I used this product morning and night. The balm itself comes in a 0.5 oz jar and is a nice shade of yellow. Its consistency and texture is similar to Vaseline; the balm did not have much of a smell, but did glide on nicely.
It was incredibly hydrating and after about 10-minutes, my eyes did indeed look brighter and more moisturized — even my makeup seemed to look a brighter!
After

One thing to keep in mind: Applying this product at night is a no-brainer — and a great time to let it do its magic. During the day, if you must use it in the morning (as the packaging suggests), give yourself at least a half hour before applying makeup. 
Because this balm’s consistency is a lot oilier than most eye creams, you may find yourself with a slippery mess while applying your eye makeup.
Firm, hydrate and revitalize tired eyes with Bliss Firm, Baby, Firm Total Eye System — gel/cream for upper lids and under eyes. Read our review —> HERE!
To avoid this hassle, especially in the summer months, I would advise busy ladies (or women with oily skin) to only use this product at night. During winter months, however, applying the balm during the day might be a more plausible option.
Available at Indielee.com and Henri Bendel New York.
