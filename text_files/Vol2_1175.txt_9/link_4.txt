These products have really helped them soften and hydrate. The hand wash is like an exfoliation cleanser and make your hands feels smooth after its rinsed off. And the hand lotion is easily absorbed into my skin not greasy like other lotions can be.               D           Don Janofskey        Comfort for your hands Almost as soon you put on your hands feel a lot better               J           Joyce        Big help! All three products in this bundle are gentle and do not irritate my eczema prone skin. Also, they don't irritate any small abrasions or cuts. The protective lotion is not slippery under nitrile gloves. It is a big help because I work in food service and massage therapy, so my hands have to stay in good shape.               T           Taylor Ready        Amazing! I purchased this for my husband who is a welder. This has worked WONDERS on his hands. He now uses the barrier cream as a part of his daily care routine. Definitely recommend!               V           Vivian Nakano        It works! The cream stays in the skin.  Gives it time to heal.             12
