These will be extremely helpful to the reader. The following information is supplied for each product, as available, in the manufacturers own words: Company name and product category. Trade names and product numbers. Product description: a description of the products main features, as described by the supplier. The three volumes of this book will be of value to technical and managerial personnel involved in the preparation of products made with these plastics additives as well as to the suppliers of the basic raw materials. My fullest appreciation is expressed to the companies and organizations who supplied the data included in this book. March, 2001  Ernest W. Flick  To Wil and Marilyn  This page intentionally left blank  Preface  The Third Edition of this useful book is divided into three volumes. Volume II describes almost 1,400 plastics additives which are currently available to industry. It is the result of information received from 74 industrial companies and other organizations. The data represents selections from manufacturers descriptions made at no cost to, nor influence from, the makers or distributors of these materials. Only the most recent information has been included. It is believed that all of the products listed here are currently available, which will be of utmost interest to readers concerned with product discontinuances. Plastics additives, a complex and growing group of minerals and chemical derivatives, account for 15 to 20% by weight of the total volume of plastic products marketed. They are produced by a large number of companies for a wide variety of customers and needs. Growth of the use of these additives, which impart one or more desirable properties to resins, is relatively strong, about 3.5 to 4% per year. Environmental constraints, however, have imposed rigorous performance requirements on many products, thus placing added expenses on the development costs of these materials. Plastics additives are divided into logical sections in three volumes. Volume I: I. Adhesion Promoters II. Anti-Fogging Agents  LEE  LEEE 2HAB=?A III. Antioxidants IV. Anti-Static Agents V. Antibacterials/Fungicides/Mildewcides VI. Bonding, Blowing and Foaming Agents VII. Dispersants VIII. Fillers and Extenders IX. Fire and Flame Retardants/Smoke Suppressants Volume II: X. Impact Modifiers XI. Initiators XII. Lubricants XIII. Micas XIV. Pigments, Colorants, and Dyes XV. Plasticizers and Esters XVI. Processing Aids XVII. Release Agents XVIII. Silanes, Titanates, and Zirconates XIX. Slip and Anti-Blocking Agents Volume III: XX. Stabilizers XXI. Stearates XXII. UV Absorbers XXIII. Viscosity Regulators XXIV. Waxes XXV. Miscellaneous and Multipurpose Compounds The Table of Contents of each volume is organized to also serve as a subject index. Each raw material is located in the section which is most applicable. The reader seeking a specific raw material should check each section which could possibly apply. In addition to the  NOTICE To the best of our knowledge the information in this publication is accurate; however, the Publisher does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of, or consequences arising from, such information. This industrial guide does not purport to contain detailed user instructions, and by its range and scope could not possibly do so. Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement or recommendation for use by the Publisher. In some cases plastics additives could be toxic, and therefore due caution should be exercised. Final determination of the suitability of any information or product for use contemplated by any user, and the manner of that use, is the sole responsibility of the user. We strongly recommend that users seek and adhere to a manufacturers or suppliers current instructions for handling each material they use. The Author and Publisher have used their best efforts to include only the most recent data available. The reader is cautioned to consult the supplier in case of questions regarding current availability.

stabilizer/activators have been formulated to provide controlled, uniform gas evolution for the production of PVC foams utilizing azodicarbonamide as the blowing agent. The ABC series of blowing agent catalysts are primary materials and act as both heat stabilizers and gas generation activators. No secondary stabilizer is normally required. Thus, with the availability of such blowing agent catalysts, the use range of azodicarbonamide is extended to a significant degree.  ABC-1: Decomposition Range: 340 to 360F Activity Rate: High  ABC-2: Decomposition Range: 330 to 350F Activity Rate: High  ABC-6*: Decomposition Range: 390 to 400F Activity Rate: Low  ABC-7: Decomposition Range: 390 to 410F Activity Rate: Low  ABC-18: Decomposition Range: 340 to 360F Activity Rate: Medium  ABC-4810: Decomposition Range: 330 to 350F Activity Rate: High · ·  *Note: ABC-6 functions as a stabilizer/de-activator resulting in a controlled blow with very fine cell structure.  6  Plastics Additives  Akcros Chemicals America: Stabilizers for Flexible Vinyl: Calcium Zinc Based Stabilizers: General Purpose: LT-2001M: Heat Stability, Printability, Plastisol: Excellent Lubricity, Clarity, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering: Good  LT-4468: Plastisol: Excellent Printability: Recommended Heat Stability, Clarity: Good  CAZ-4842: Heat Stability, Plastisol: Excellent Clarity: Good  CAZ-4949: Heat Stability: Excellent Lubricity, Low-odor/Volatility, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering: Recommended  Food Contact: CZ-11D: Foam Activation, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering, Plastisol: Recommended Heat Stability, Lubricity, Clarity: Good  CZ-19A: Heat Stability, Lubricity, Foam Activation, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering: Recommended Clarity: Good  CZL-717: Clarity, Plastisol: Excellent Heat Stability, Low Plateout, Printability: Recommended Foam Activation, Calendering: Good  CZL-720: Clarity, Plastisol: Excellent Printability: Recommended Heat Stability, Low Plateout, Foam Activation: Good  CZL-720A: Clarity, Plastisol: Excellent Heat Stability, Printability: Recommended Low Plateout, Foam Activation, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering: Good  Stabilizers 7  Akros Chemicals America: Stabilizers for Flexible Vinyl: Chelators and Auxiliaries: CH-55 (FDA): Printability, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering, Plastisol: Recommended Heat Stability, Clarity: Good  CH-301: Printability: Excellent Heat Stability, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering: Recommended Clarity, Plastisol: Good  P-2307*: Heat Stability, Clarity, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering, Plastisol: Recommended Low-odor/Volatility, Printability: Good  SA-5038: Printability: Excellent Heat Stability, Foam Activation, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering: Recommended  Ca Stearate: Heat Stability, Lubricity: Excellent Low-odor/Volatility, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering: Recommended Printability: Good  Zn Stearate: Lubricity: Excellent Low-odor/Volatility, Foam Activation, Extrusion/Inj.Mldg., Calendering: Recommended Heat Stability, Clarity, Printability: Good *Note: PLASTOFLEX 2307 is a high-quality epoxidized soy bean oil with a minimum oxirane content of 6.8%.  8  Plastics Additives  Akcros Chemicals America: Stabilizers for Flexible Vinyl: Metal Soap Based Stabilizers: Barium Cadmium Based Stabilizers: BC-103A: Heat Stability, Clarity, Foam Activation, Extrusion/Inj.

The product actively scavenges acidic groups as well as water. The product significantly increases the resistance to hydrolysis of polyester based urethane elastomers. Staboxol I also increases the long term stability of Baycoll and Desmocoll based adhesives in hot humid climates. The addition of 0.5 parts of Stabaxol I per 100 parts of polyester approximately doubles the level of hydrolysis resistance at ambient temperature compared to an unstabilized elastomer. The addition of 2 parts of Stabaxol I per 100 parts of polyester will increase hydrolysis resistance about four fold at ambient temperature. The use of more than 2 parts by weight is not recommended, since Stabaxol I may leach from some end products. Also, Stabaxol I does not have the catalytic effect on the isocyanate-polyol reaction that Stabaxol M had. Product Description: Physical form: Yellowish waxlike substance Melting point: Approx. 40C Density: Approx. 0.95 g/ml at 50C Stabaxol I is soluble in selected organic solvents such as acetone, methylene chloride, toluene, and polyester.  Stabilizers 55  Rhein Chemie Corp.: STABAXOL Antihydrolysis Agents (Continued): STABAXOL P Antihydrolysis Agent: CAS No.: 81972-48-7 Aromatic Polycarbodiimide Application: Stabaxol P is typically used to improve the hydrolytic stability of plastics containing ester groups, including millable gum polyurethanes and will significantly improve the hot air resistance of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers. Due to wide variation in application areas, it is recommended that users determine the optimum level of addition for each system. Typically, 0.5 to 5 pbw of Stabaxol P per 100 parts of compound (100% solid) is recommended. Stabaxol P, as supplied, contains approximately 4% of inorganic material to prevent lump formation. Stabaxol P will not normally bloom from a finished polymer.

UV absorbers are based on substituted hydroxybenzotriazoles, which are less prone to discoloration than absorbers based on hydroxybenzophenones.  Stanlight P UV Absorber: Stanlight P is economical but also volatile and less soluble in most solvents. Stanlight P is recommended especially for ambient cure systems, and for some resins in thick section. It is not recommended for two component urethane systems because of the possibility of the hydroxyl group on the stabilizer reacting with the isocyanate. (A similar situation is true with most HALS). Stanlight P can also be used in conjunction with Stanlight 770 to provide optimum protection to polyolefins in thick section, especially when pigmented with light-sensitive colorants. In addition, most coatings systems benefit from a combination of UV absorber and HALS.  Stanlight 770 UV Light Stabilizer: Stanlight 770 general purpose HALS recommended for a variety of materials. Especially recommended for polypropylene thick section, also polypropylene tape. Stanlight 770 can also be used in conjunction with Stanlight P to provide optimum protection to polyolefins in thick section, especially when pigmented with light-sensitive colorants. In addition, most coatings systems benefit from a combination of UV absorber and HALS. Stanlight 770 UV Light Stabilizer is a hindered amine light stabilizer. It is highly effective in the most demanding UV light stabilization applications including use in polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, EPDM, poly and all styrenic polymers. Stanlight 770 can be combined with UV absorbers to optimize a polymer’s UV light stabilization properties. It has no effect on the polymer’s color, as there is no absorption in the visual spectrum. Stanlight 770 is highly effective in applications exhibiting high surface areas or having large cross sections.  94  Plastics Additives  3V Inc.: UVASORB Light Stabilizers: Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers (HALS): UVASORB HA77 DF: Uvasorb HA77 DF is the most effective and most used low molecular weight HALS. Its monomeric structure makes it particularly suitable in the stabilization of thick plastic articles (>0.5 mm thick) A slow migration during time (years) increases the HALS concentration on the article surface where the UV degradation occurs. Uvasorb HA77 DF is highly effective and recommended for the light stabilization of polyolefins, olefin copolymers, PP elastomer blends, styrenic polymers, polyacetals and polyamides. The concentration of Uvasorb HA77 DF depends on the polymer type, the desired service life, and the formulation and the thickness of the plastic article. Typical dosages are between 0.05% and 0.5%. Low molecular weight stabilizers have some disadvantages such as: * too high migration rates for thin section applications * low resistance to extraction * poor resistance to thermal treatments To overcome these limits polymeric HALS were developed. 3V patented one of the most effective high molecular weight HALS: Uvasorb HA88.  Uvasorb HA88 FD: Uvasorb HA88 FD polymeric structure guarantees a molecular weight of about 3000 Dalton, superior to other similar products. Thanks to its high molecular weight and structure is very suitable for use in thin applications such as agricultural films, fibers, filaments and coatings to which confers an excellent Light and Long Term Heat Stability. Main features correlated to its structure and high molecular weight are: low volatility; high resistance to extraction; no effect on melt flow; low interaction with pigments. Uvasorb HA88 FD is used also in effective combinations with UV absorbers, low molecular weight HALS and antioxidants. The contribution of HALS to Long Term Heat Stability of polymers is already well documented in literature. The effect of HALS as Long Term Heat Stabilizers is competitive with traditional antioxidants up to 130C. This effect is particularly evident in PP Fibers in which Uvasorb HA88 FD is one of the most efficient and appreciated HALS in the market for the UV protection and also for the superior Long Term Heat Stabilization.  UV Absorbers  95  3V Inc.: UVASORB Light Stabilizers: Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers(Continued): Uvasorb HA78 FF: The combination of Uvasorb HA88 FD and Uvasorb HA77 DF gives very high light stability to polyolefins tapes and to the talc filled Polypropylene copolymer compounds usually used for automotive applications. The 50:50 blend of Uvasorb HA88 FD and Uvasorb HA77 DF is available under the trade name Uvasorb HA78 FF. Other advantages offered by 3V's HALS are: * High resistance to processing conditions (e.g. temperature) * High compatibility with a wide range of plastic materials * Low absorbtivity in visible region  96  Plastics Additives  3V Inc.: UVASORB Light Stabilizers: U.V. Absorbers: UV Absorbers (UVA) protect the polymers by absorbing the detrimental UV radiation responsible for their degradation. The protection mechanism exerted by UV Absorbers is based essentially on the absorption of UV radiation and consequent dissipation of the absorbed energy in a manner that does not lead to photooxidation, i.e. dissipation as heat. Hydroxy benzophenones and Hydroxyphenyl benzotriazoles are the UVA structures produced and studied by 3V. The large choice of structures allow them to cover all the application fields of different polymers. The light stability of an article is influenced by the polymer type, crystallinity, orientation degree, pigment type and concentration and also by the article thickness. The amount of radiation absorbed with an UVA is related to its concentration and extinction coefficient as well as to the sample thickness according to the Lambert Beer law. The internal layers far from the surface of the article are more protected than superficial ones. This is the main limitation of UVA that makes them suitable mainly for thick articles. Nevertheless the performance of UVA may be improved both in thin and thick articles when used in combination with HALS. 3V's UV absorbers family includes: Benzophenones: Uvasorb 3C Uvasorb 20H Uvasorb MET Uvasorb WP Benzotriazoles: Uvasorb SV Uvasorb S26 Uvasorb S27 Uvasorb S28  Section XXIII Viscosity Regulators  98  Plastics Additives  Degussa: AEROSIL for PVC Plastisols: This highly dispersed silica Aerosil has been an established concept in the plastics industry for years. In many cases where problems of controlling viscosity such as thickening and thixotropizing must be solved, Aerosil – thanks to its extremely fine particles and high chemical purity – has proven very effective. This statement also applies to the field of PVC plastisols.  Aerosil 200 Aerosil 300 Aerosil 380 Aerosil is a synthetically derived silica which is produced by hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride in an oxyhydrogen flame. This synthesis results in very pure, highly-dispersed silicas, the specific surface areas of which are used to designate the various grades of the product. That is, the numbers 200, 300, and 380 indicate that the particular product has a specific surface area of 200, 300, and 380 m2/g respectively.

Ross Co., Inc.: ROSS Wax No. 130, No. 145, No. 165: Petroleum waxes are used primarily to delay fusion and reduce the high melt viscosities associated with initial fusion in the extrusion of plastics. The most commonly used petroleum waxes are those melting at about 130 to 165F. This melting range represents carbon chains approximately 40 atoms long. Although the congealing point is the most common means of classifying petroleum based lubricants, it is not the determining factor in predicting external behavior. The extent of branching and presence of cyclic components greatly influence the external properties. Ross Wax No. 130, No. 145 and No. 165 are fully refined, high melting point petroleum waxes. They are widely used in the formulating of PVC and electrical wire and cable compounds, as well as other applications which require a lubricant which is effective in small quantities without danger of exudation.

Typical of PVC products compounded with Busan 11-M1 are automotive tops and trims, inflatable buildings, pond liners, roofing, and plastic-coated fabrics such as tarpaulins and awnings. The effectiveness of Busan 11-M1 as a fire retardant is restricted to polymers containing a halogen donor or to which one can be combined. Bromine compounds are somewhat more effective than other halogens but chlorinated paraffin and chlorindic anhydride have performed very well. Experience has indicated that Busan 11-M1 can replace antimony trioxide in most fire retardant formulations. Subject to the degree of halogenation and the degree of fire resistance required. Replacement can be 50 to 100%. In addition to providing after-flame resistance, Busan 11-M1 also reduces the time of afterglow (i.e., flameless combustion) and in many formulations reduces the amount of smoke generation. Other advantages over antimony trioxide are the low refractive index of Busan 11-M1 which prevents interference in tint and dye requirements and the fungicidal activity that characterizes barium metaborate. Busan 11-M1 is well known as a fungicide for coatings and plastics. Its advantages in plastics and plastic-coated fabrics over conventional organic fungicides are longevity in the film and efficacy unaffected by UV exposure. Products particularly susceptible by fungal disfigurement and/or deterioration include pond liners, tarpaulins, awnings, and shower curtains. Busan 11-M1 provides UV light stabilization to most polymeric materials including PVC and glass-reinforced polyester. Its durability in these materials is outstanding and thus extends the performance of UV absorbers.
