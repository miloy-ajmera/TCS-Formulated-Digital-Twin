Description
Specification

	Our lanolin is produced in China, where most of the world’s wool is processed today, from the multi-stage refining of wool grease, a natural, renewable raw material which is obtained from the scouring (washing) of raw wool. The origins of the bulk of the wool is Australia and New Zealand and it is manufactured to fully meet the requirements of the current European Pharmacopoeia and existing national requirements for pesticide residues. We tend to use wool grease from merino fine wool which provides for a good quality lanolin. Avena lanolin has been refined to a point where trace pesticide residues are practically undetectable, so you can buy with confidence. The high purity of our lanolin, without sacrificing product colour, makes it ideal for topical pharmaceutical preparations, suppositories, lip products and body creams and lotions. Lanolin can be used in the most exacting applications where colour, odour and purity are critical and is still bought today by many customers to use directly on the hands and feet especially for rough, dry and cracked skin. The intensive healing of natural lanolin assists in restoring the hands and feet to a smooth, healthy condition. © Please do not copy text. Avena product description – Lanolin (Adeps lanae).

	Just wanted to let you know that the combo of face products I'm using from the shop must be working as I was asked for ID in Morrisons yesterday!

	Thank you so much for the prompt delivery of my order, which is very much appreciated, and for the kind gift of a pen. The ink in an existing one ran out today!

	I am very pleased with the items ordered and will certainly call in the shop when I can.

	Hi Keith,

	I received my order today and did receive a "goodie" bag. I am delighted with all my purchases and want to thank you 

	for the extras. I must say that your customer service is first class! I received my parcel a lot sooner than I thought and as I said couldn't be more pleased with the items. I will certainly use your company again and have already recommended you to friends.

	Thanks again.

	Dear Sir

	I came into your shop in Skipton recently with three friends, one of whom had used your O.S.T. Ointment for several years for a painful knee joint. My other friend and I bought jars for similar painful knees. After 24 hours use we now call this ‘miracle ointment’. To be relieved of pain and now finding walking and stairs a lot easier it is just such a relief.

	Yours faithfully

Mrs Carol Arnold
 



	Just a quick note to say thank you for my speedy delivery of the gifts I ordered. They smell wonderful and am now placing my third order but this time to treat myself.

	Thanks again. 

Joan
 



	Dear Sir

	I recently purchased my second jar of Active Life cream. I thought I would take the time to write to let you know how fantastic the cream is but also how helpful the lady in the shop was. I needed the cream urgently before we flew on holiday and so I called to order. The lady who took my order upgraded it to First Class (free of charge) and even said she would try to get in that days post. I received the cream in plenty of time and will be back for more when this has run out. Thank you for the lovely customer service.

	Kind regards 

Geoff
 



	Dear Keith,
