				How EpiCeram Works:
				
				The Skin's Natural Barrier
			

				The outermost layer of the skin is called the stratum corneum, which is made up of cells called corneocytes. The purpose of this important layer is to protect the skin from bacteria or allergens as well as to help the skin retain water and other important substances necessary for skin protection. The corneocytes are embedded and supported by a lipid-rich matrix to help keep the normal function of this important skin barrier. The skin barrier can be visualized as corneocytes representing the âbricks of a wallâ, and the rich lipid matrix the âmortarâ. When this system breaks down, many skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis can present themselves. EpiCeram forms a tri-lipid layer on the top of skin, allowing for more moisturization and facilitating an optimum environment for skin barrier repair.
