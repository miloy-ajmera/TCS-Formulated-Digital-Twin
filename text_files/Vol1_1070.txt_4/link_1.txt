What Is Liquid Paraffin?
Liquid paraffin is a highly refined mineral oil that has been through extreme refinement, usually for its use in cosmetics (1).
Mineral oil, in general terms, can be understood as a substance that is colorless and odorless oil and is made by using a specific type of mineral. In the case of liquid paraffin, usually, petroleum distillate is used.
Petroleum distillate is a by-product of refining crude oil that is used to generate gasoline and other petroleum products. Petroleum is extracted from the earth and thus is a natural liquid. This is refined in order to get liquid paraffin.


How Useful Is Liquid Paraffin For Skin?

Liquid paraffin is used in many different skincare and hair care products. Light liquid paraffin is one of the best remedies to treat dry skin conditions. It is highly moisturizing and also contains cleansing agents that help keep skin clear.
Liquid paraffin is also used as one of the ingredients in after-wax wipes as it soothes skin.
Light liquid paraffin is also a great emollient that helps in softening the skin. It also helps in calming the skin and thus reduces itchy skin and irritation (2).
Liquid paraffin also helps in preventing excess water evaporation or water loss from the outer layer of skin and thus helps in retaining the moisture of the skin and reduces skin dehydration and leaves the skin

Liquid paraffin also helps in opening pores and removing dead skin cells, thus giving you clear skin. Liquid paraffin can be used on the face and body..
Liquid paraffin is also used in many different cosmetic products. Some of the products with liquid paraffin include lipsticks, lotions, creams, ointments, etc.
Liquid paraffin is used in the treatment of dry skin. White soft paraffin creates a layer of oil on the surface of the skin.

What Are The Benefits Of Using Liquid Paraffin For The Skin?
As seen above, there are many uses of liquid paraffin for the skin. It ought to be that there are several benefits of this oil which is widely used in the cosmetic industry.
Following are some of the benefits of using liquid paraffin for skin:
1. Moisturizing Agent
Liquid paraffin oil is one of the greatest moisturizing products as it helps in holding moisture onto the skin and also softens the skin. It leaves the skin soft and smooth by removing dirt and dust from the skin. Paraffin oil has many skin benefits, as it helps in reducing acne, dark spots, and blemishes and gives you clear skin. It also reduces skin itching due to dry skin.
2. Increases Elasticity Of The Skin
The skin usually reduces its elasticity which makes the skin look dull. Skin also loses its elasticity due to pollution and changing weather conditions. Like, in cold weather, skin can become excessively dry and dull. 
This makes the skin look rough. Light liquid paraffin oil can be used as a skin treatment ingredient that can help regain the elasticity of the skin. Liquid paraffin helps in taking extra care of the skin.
3. Skin Softening
Liquid paraffin is one of the greatest skin-softening ingredients that one can include in their skin care regimen.  Liquid paraffin helps in retaining water in the skin and protects from skin dehydration. Dehydrated skin looks uneven, dry, and dull. Paraffin oil can be used to treat the issue of uneven skin and dull skin. It helps the skin become soft and hydrated.
4. Reduces Swelling
One of the greatest benefits of using liquid paraffin is that it boosts collagen production. It helps in increasing blood flow in the skin and makes your skin younger looking. Applying light liquid paraffin oil helps in calming the skin and also helps improve skin texture (3).
5. Helps Remove Dead Skin Cells
Liquid paraffin oil helps in unclogging pores and removing dead skin. Dirt and dust cover the pores and make it difficult for oxygen to reach your skin. Oxygen flow in the skin is necessary to help improve skin health.
Removing dead skin cells helps soothe the face and makes it look soft and supple. It helps in healing dry, uneven, and cracked skin.

Is Liquid Paraffin Good For Your Skin?
All the talk about the benefits of paraffin for skin is good, but everything that is good is not always safe. So, is liquid paraffin good for your skin? Liquid paraffin is considered to be a good product for the skin and is used as an ingredient in cosmetics.
Research has shown that liquid paraffin is safe to use and it is needless to say that it is an inexpensive skin care agent. Studies have shown that applying paraffin on the skin does not cause any adverse effect on the skin.
Liquid paraffin, which also goes by mineral oil, is commonly used in various skincare and cosmetic products because of its moisturizing activities. It is generally considered safe for use on the skin in small amounts, however long term or overuse can lead to certain side effects. What are the side effects of using liquid paraffin?
The common side effect of using liquid paraffin on the skin is the clogging of pores, which can lead to acne and other skin irritations. It also causes a decrease in the skin's ability to absorb nutrients and eliminate toxins. In some cases, prolonged use of liquid paraffin can cause the development of lipid pneumonia. 
This lipid pneumonia is a type of lung inflammation caused by the inhalation of oil droplets. This is common in those working in spas and salons. Inhaling the fumes of paraffin can lead to respiratory problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and other lung diseases. Some studies have proven this risk of paraffin.
Some people may be more sensitive to liquid paraffin than others. Hence, it is always a good idea to consult with a general physician or a dermatologist before using any new skincare products, especially if you have pre-existing skin conditions or allergies.
Criticism of Liquid Paraffin
Many experts suggest that paraffin does not actually moisturize the skin. It is the mineral oil on the surface of the skin that gives a smooth texture and not the actual skin. It creates a sensory illusion. The moisturization is from other sources; paraffin only helps retain the moisture for a short duration of time.
Paraffin can also clog the pores if not cleaned after use. The clogged pores can result in acne and pimples. Research has shown that using paraffin does not cause acne or pimples. It is non-comedogenic, which means it doesn’t clog pores. However, those having acne prone skin must consult with a dermatologist before using paraffin based products.
Is Paraffin The Same As Vaseline?
Do you know the differences between paraffin and Vaseline? Are paraffin and Vaseline the same?
Paraffin and Vaseline are both anhydrous and petroleum-based products and are used for various purposes, but they do have some subtle differences.
Paraffin is a waxy substance derived from petroleum. It is commonly used in cosmetic and even medical products, including moisturizers, lip balms and candles. Paraffin is a hydrocarbon mixture that is solid at room temperature, but melts quite easily with a small amount of heat.
Vaseline, on the other hand, is not the name of a product, but a brand name for petroleum jelly, which is a semi-solid mixture of hydrocarbons derived from petroleum. It is commonly used as a skin moisturizer. It forms a protective barrier on the skin surface.
Paraffin is commonly used in spa treatments as a moisturizing and softening agent for the skin. Vaseline on the other hand is commonly used for chapped lips, dry skin (think winter season), and minor burns. Paraffin has a slightly different texture than Vaseline.
Both paraffin and Vaseline are petroleum-based products and have similar properties, but different uses and applications.
