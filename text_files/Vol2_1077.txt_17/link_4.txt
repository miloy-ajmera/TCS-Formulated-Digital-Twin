A decadent, velvety cream your luminous skin will thank you for
This potent, lightweight emulsion is concentrated with carefully selected phytonutrients that hydrate — not irritate — the fragile skin around your eyes, lips and neck. Starting with a 1:1 ratio of CBD and THC from organic, full-spectrum cannabis, we add caffeine and then blend with organic calendula, rosemary, avocado oil, shea butter, and plant-derived squalene. Like cannabis, caffeine is a fabulous anti-inflammatory and antioxidant that fights skin-damaging free radicals, plus it boosts circulation (just like when we drink it), which is where the tightening and de-puffing action comes in.
Cannabis is unlike any other skincare
Your endocannabinoid system (ECS) is the secret to understanding why this small pot of eye cream delivers such big results. Your skin is your largest organ, and every layer is covered in endocannabinoid receptors. Cannabinoids in cannabis mimic endocannabinoids to signal to your ECS receptors to create balance. Cannabinoids are also extra powerful antioxidants, perfect for neutralizing free radicals (like those caused by sun damage) — the main culprit of premature aging.
Highest quality product

Award-winning at the Emerald Cup, "the Academy Awards of Cannabis"

Made with OCal-certified organic full-spectrum cannabis
Purity, safety and label accuracy verified by independent lab

How to use
MORNING AND NIGHT: After cleansing, apply pea-sized amount around the eyes, especially the crows-feet area, and gently blend in with the fingertips. 
Many people (including us) also use it on other delicate skin, such as above the lips and on the neck and décolletage.
PRO-TIP: Note from professional makeup artist Amilia Large: “Works beautifully as a primer under makeup too.”
 
For external use only. Keep out of reach of children. If pregnant, nursing, or under a doctor’s care, consult a physician before use.

Certificate of Analysis (COA) test results
All of our products are made of nourishing, real plants and are free of potentially harmful ingredients too often found in cosmetics — including parabens, phthalates, sulfates, PEGs, PFAS, colorants, added fragrance, etc.
In addition, an independent lab tests every small batch of our products for potency and purity. The results prove that our products are free of over 100 contaminants, from pesticides and microbial impurities, to mycotoxins and heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium), to residual solvents and processing chemicals. Every product, every batch. We know of no other cosmetics company that goes to these lengths to assure customers of the purity and safety of their products.
Bonus: We add no fragrance to our products — the delicate scent stems from the natural botanicals inside.

Why use full-spectrum cannabis on the face? 
Your skin is your largest organ, and it’s covered in endocannabinoid receptors. Scientific studies show that when applied topically, phytocannabinoids from hemp and cannabis, such as CBD, CBG and even THC, bind with your body’s endocannabinoid system receptors and bring it back to balance. We link to more research evidence on our Cannabis & Skin page; read it here. 
Each additional botanical we add to our products is carefully chosen for its restoring properties and ability to enhance the benefits of the cannabinoids.
Our products are non-psychoactive and contain <0.3% THC — just a trace amount to add to what’s called the “entourage effect” to make it more effective.

Vegan and cruelty-free
Despite the cute bee in our name and logo, which sometimes makes people think we use honey in our products, we avoid all animal-derived ingredients, and we never, ever test on animals.
We’re Leaping Bunny and PETA certified vegan and cruelty-free.

Non-psychoactive
Our products are non-psychoactive, as the THC molecules will not go into your bloodstream through the skin. We include THC in our full-spectrum cannabis products for its healing effects on the skin – no high required.

Sustainable and conscientious 
Our paper boxes, glass jars and aluminum lids are all reusable and recyclable. We searched for months for the right planet-friendly packaging, which costs considerably more than disposable, single-use plastic, but we believe it’s worth it, and we hope you do too. 
We are on track to becoming a B Corp in 2023 and very close to 100% plastic-free. Starting January 1st, 2022 we will be a member of 1% for the Planet and enthusiastically support their mission to build an alliance of businesses financially committed to creating a healthy planet. We also contribute to environmental causes and social justice causes.










Squalane
(OLEA EUROPEA)
Green Bee Botanicals uses only plant-derived squalane. (We never use any animal derived ingredients–not even honey!) Squalene is a very light, colorless oil that is naturally occurring in human sebum. This oil has antioxidant properties and is highly moisturizing  because it absorbs very readily, leaving skin soft and supple.






Shea butter
(Vitellaria pardoxa)
Luscious and soothing, shea butter hydrates and softens the skin, and its antioxidant benefits fight free radicals to reduce the appearance of fine lines. It is rich in vitamins A, E and fatty acids like oleic and linoleic and supports the healing of the skin’s natural barrier.






Rose hydrosol
(Rosa damascena)
Steam-distilled from rose petals this captures the living cellular water from the flower petals which contains minerals and volitile oils, some even say the “life force” of the plant. The extra gentle skin benefits include hydration and moisturizing, reducing the appearance of fine lines, soothing redness and softening and toning. 
 







Avocado Oil
(Persea americana)
The antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in avocado oil help your skin stay smooth, strong, and elastic. It has a high penetration rate and is full of bioactive phytochemicals like beta carotene, tocopherols, phytosterols, minerals, and vitamins A, D and E to help moisturize and protect. It is recommended for dry, damaged and mature skin.





Caffeine

Caffeine is a potent antioxidant so it adds to the arsenal of ingredients in our Brightening Eye Cream that fight free radical damage caused by environmental toxins and sun exposure.As a vasoconstrictor it helps to immediately brighten dark circles and smooth the appearance of puffiness and fine lines around the eyes.






Calendula
(Calendula officinalis)
Calendula is very beneficial to the skin and imparts a warm, green scent. It is used in products targeted at sensitive skin because it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiseptic effects. There are dozens of components that enhance these benefits plus wound healing and brightening, including triterpenoids–particularly faradiol monoester, flavonoids, carotenoids, resin, and volatile oils.







Rosemary leaf
(Rosmarinus officinalis)
A potent antioxidant, rosemary leaf extract protects the skin and prevents damage from UV rays.  Rosmarinic acid from rosemary leaf is also powerfully healing for skin conditions like eczema and acne. In addition to its soothing and uplifting scent, rosemary also has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal benefits.






CBD
(Cannabidiol)
CBD extract from the flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant interacts with CB1 and CBD2 receptors all over our body – in what’s called the endocannabinoid system – to promote balance and optimal functioning. In our skin it helps normalize sebum production and its anti-inflammatory properties are just one of the ways it may help with issues such as acne, eczema and psoriasis. 






THC
(Tetrahydrocannabinol)
THC or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive compound in cannabis. We love THC for skin because of its proven antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and pain relieving benefits. It also contributes to a stronger entourage effect. If it enters your bloodstream, through smoking, or an edible, it produces the euphoric high that cannabis is known for, but our products, if used on the skin, will never be intoxicating.

Scent is very light and more botanical than I expected. I heard from someone that this eye cream also works on acne, so I tried it and it does! Almost overnight. Crazy. I wish it came in a bigger jar. I use it on my crows feet, above my upper lip and on my neck. And now onoccasional breakouts. So please make a bigger jar!

This brightening eye cream is a dream come true. I’ve been using $700 La Prairie eye cream for 5 years. A friend gave me Green Bee eye cream to try. It has been two months and I am in love. The results are impressive. It is luscious, hydrates amazingly and achieves exactly what I’m looking for. My eyes are “bee-happy”. My wallet is “bee-happier”!

This eye cream is amazing. It is light to medium texture. It spreads smoothly and evenly. It absorbs quickly which works great under makeup. I used this for 3 weeks and notice my under eyes were brighter, less baggy, and the fine lines were going away. I cant wait to keep using this eye cream for all the great benefits.

Green Bee’s eye cream is the only thing I trust for daily use around my eye area. With a professional background in both aesthetics and cannabis, I appreciate the fusion of amazing, carefully chosen ingredients and price point. It’s something I always keep on hand and suggest to everyone; it’s done wonders for the flare-ups around my eyes.

This eye cream puts the restorative power of cannabis to work. It’s deeply hydrating and has renewed my skin’s elasticity. It a luxurious treatment worth every penny. I’m in love with Green Bee’s Brightening Eye Cream as well as their face serum and massage oil.

The face serums and eye cream are AMAZING! I am super picky (40-year health food nut) and extremely sensitive to food and skin products. So I had some trepidation about the oil base and essential oils and scent in the serums, but when I tried them they felt like laying the essence of flower petals on my skin. The scent is super delicate, barely there, and the oil has a beautiful, light texture that absorbs nicely in not much time. And my skin reacted with nothing but happiness!
