Glass Cleaner
      
Cleaners
are substances that are typically used to eliminate   
stains, smells, dirt, dust, and general clutter on a
variety of
surfaces. The use of household cleaners consist of providing a
healthier space
as some cleaners can remove harmful bacteria, the removal of harsh or
offensive
smells, and to prevent the spread of dirt and contaminants. There are a
variety
of different types of cleaners that service different purposes.
Glass
is amongst the hardest
of common construction materials currently being used. However, even
though
glass is very hard it is susceptible to damage from a variety of
sources and
requires care and regular maintenance to retain the original
appearance. Since
the primary purpose of glass is to be viewed through, damage to the
glass can
easily detract from its original condition and clarity vision. Glass is
one of
the most utilized building materials because of its durability, beauty
and
transparent properties that help connect to the outside environment.
Keeping
this in mind, a correct cleaning procedure plays a vital role in
maintaining
the visual and structural qualities of the glass.
Glass
cleaners have a tough job.  They have to dissolve dirt and
grime, leave a surface shiny, and most importantly, they have to do it
all
without leaving telltale streaks or films.  It’s a tall order,
but the
research and chemistry behind glass cleaners have made it all possible.
Glass
cleaners usually contain surfactants and solvents that adhere to the
glass
surface and lift away dirt and grime, providing shiny surfaces extra
sparkle.  Sometimes they even have fragrances for a pleasant
aroma. 
This highly efficient combination helps to easily clean surfaces
without
leaving the residue that appears in our mirrors and windows as streaks.
Applications
•     These
have their major application in every

Mosquito
Coils
Mosquitoes are one of the most
harmful insects to
mankind.          
Mosquitoes grow in
every place where environment is not kept clean, neat and tidy. To
destroy them
many preparations are available in the market in various recipies like
pest
killer spray, soap, oil, powder, repellent etc. Out of these, mosquito
repellent is the most popular as it has germicidal and disinfectant
properties
and is able to repel mosquitoes and is convenient to use.
Mosquito coil is
mosquito-repelling incense, usually
shaped into a spiral, and typically made from a dried paste of pyrethrum
powder. The coil is
usually held at the center
of the spiral, suspending it in the air, or wedged by two pieces of
fireproof
nettings to allow continuous smoldering. Burning usually begins at the
outer
end of the spiral and progresses slowly toward the centre of the
spiral,
producing a mosquito-repellent smoke. The basic ingredient used in
mosquito
coils is ‘Pyrethrum’. Another material viz. Allethrin is also used in
preparing
the mosquito coils.
With the growth of population and
standard of living of the
masses, Mosquito repellents have emerged as most useful tools in
households
preventing epidemics like Malaria, Filaria, Dengue fever and other
Mosquito
spread diseases. Considering these factors there is a good scope for
setting up
units for manufacturing repellents like Mosquito Coils.
Uses and Application
Mosquito coil is used for
repelling and killing of
household insects like mosquitoes, flies and garden insects. Because of
the
pyrethrin contained in it, the mosquitoes usually die in its vicinity.
Properties
Some physical and chemical
properties of mosquito coil
are:
•     The
product is chemically stable
•     Under
normal condition of storage and use
hazardous reaction will not occur.
•     Flashpoint

•    
Vapour Density
(air=1): 1.009 g/mL @ 20 °C (d-cis trans Allethrin Technical).
Naphthalene Balls
      
Naphthalene
C10H8, sometimes called ‘TARCAMPHOR’
is a colourless crystalline-flaked solid with the familiar odour of
mothballs.
Naphthalene C10H8 is
an aromatic hydrocarbon with two condensed
ring aromatic compounds.
Naphthalene
is a white solid
chemical that vaporizes easily. It has a strong smell. You can
sometimes smell
naphthalene in the air or in water. Naphthalene is used in mothballs
and moth
flakes. Petroleum and coal contain naphthalene.
Mothballs
and other products
containing naphthalene are solids that turn into toxic gas. The toxic
gas kills
insects and may repel animals.
A
good commercial grade of
naphthalene (called 78° Naphthalene, referring to the melting point) is
approximately 96% pure. Refined naphthalene is available in flakes,
pellets,
and balls. Use of Naphthalene as an insect repellent has dwindled in
recent
years as other materials, e.g. p-dichlorobenzene, have displaced it.
It
is a consumable product,
hence it finds extensive application in cities. General awareness is
improving
in cleanliness and hence this product has got good scope for growth.
Uses & Application
The
most important outlets for
Naphthalene are in the dyestuff industry and the manufacture of
phthalic
anhydride for synthetic resins. It is also used in the manufacture of
lampblack, as an addition to enrich the illuminating gas and motor
fuels, and
as an insecticides and soil fumigant.
It
is used as intermediate for the manufacture of phthalic anhydride
teralin,
declin, chlorinated naphthalenes and dyes. It is most widely used as
moth repellant
and fungicides in homes. 
Other
important applications are as explosives, cutting fluids lubricants,
preservatives. It is sometimes used as a solvent for certain chemicals.
Its
minor uses are as textile chemicals, emulsions breakers. 
Naphthalene
balls are used as moth repellent and fungicide in homes to prevent the
woolen
clothes. Due to the volatile character of naphthalene, balls are
vaporizes and
require some additives wherever these are used. These are also used in
urinals
and toilets to prevent the bad smell.
Properties
Hot
pressed Naphthalene, relatively free of oils, has a melting 168.8 to
172.4*F.
It should be noted, however, that these temperatures are somewhat lower
than
given for the pure naphthalene. As the oil content increases, the
melting point
drops accordingly. 
Crude
naphthalene is generally produced by the fractional distillation of
coal tar.
It exists in various forms depending upon the amount of oil present. It
is also
formed in certain processes for making fuel gases where it causes
trouble in
gas distribution systems by depositing in small lines and accessions.
Naphthalene
is known to domestic users as mothballs. It is also used in the
manufacture of
dyes, phthalic acid, explosives, lamp black, varnishes, in grease for
greasing
vehicles, as an antiseptic, in the fun industry. Hydrogenated
naphthalene is
also used in making tetralin & decalin, which have been used as
solvents
& motor fuels. Naphthalene is also used in a under variety of
chemical
compounds.
Tooth Paste
     
Toothpastes
claim to clean, remove plaque, prevent cavities, 
and whiten teeth. Teeth are the calcified structures in our mouths that
are
used to break down food. 
Toothpaste
is a paste or gel
dentifrice used, with a toothbrush, to clean and maintain the
aesthetics and
health of teeth. Toothpaste serves as an abrasive that aids in removing
the
dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing
halitosis, and
delivers active ingredients such as fluoride or xylitol to help prevent
tooth
and gum disease. Teeth are made of multiple tissues of varying density
and
hardness.
Toothpastes
are generally
either white abrasive pastes or clear gels. Although the formulations
differ,
they are made from similar ingredients; these may vary from country to
country
according to legislation on use of ingredients etc. Toothpastes contain
active
ingredients or additives that perform specific functions. These
additives are
abrasives, fluorides, desensitizing agents, antiplaque agents, and
antitartar
ingredients. Toothpastes also contain detergents, humectants,
thickeners,
preservatives, flavoring agents, sweeteners, and coloring agents. The
most
commonly used humectants (sorbitol and glycerin) have a sweetness level
about
60% of table sugar. They require an artificial flavor to make the
toothpaste
palatable. Saccharin is the most common sweetener used, though some
toothpastes
contain ammoniated diglyzzherizins and/or aspartame.
Fluorides
reduce decay by increasing the strength of teeth. Sodium fluoride is
the most
commonly used fluoride. Sodium perborate is used as
a tooth
whitening ingredient. Most toothpastes contain the
preservative
p-hydrozybenzoate.
Toothpastes
have flavors to make them more palatable. Mint is the most common
flavor used
because it imparts a feeling of freshness. This feeling of freshness is
the
result of long term conditioning by the toothpaste
industry. The most
common toothpaste flavors are spearmint, peppermint, wintergreen, and
cinnamon.
Some of the more exotic toothpaste flavors include bourbon, rye, anise,
clove,
caraway, coriander, eucalyptus, nutmeg, and thyme.
Henna Based Hair
Dye
       
Hair dye
is one of the oldest known beauty preparations, and 
was used by ancient cultures in many parts of the world.
Lots of
people occasionally have the urge to change or enhance their hair
color, but
are unwilling to use the harsh and, in some cases, potentially harmful
hair
dying chemicals found in most commercial dyes and color rinses. A need
was felt
to formulate a dye containing only plant products which is safe for use
and
does not have the problems of staining skin during use and
hypersensitive
reactions. A dye can generally be described as a colored substance that
has an affinity
to the fiber, fur or hair.
Henna’s
leaves have a
red-orange dye molecule, Lawson, visible in young leaves in the center
vein of
the leaf. Henna leaves are abundantly used for making different types
of
colours. Henna leaves have very high commercial value. Henna leaves may
be used
fresh, though they are more often harvested, dried, and powdered. It
has
natural properties to produce colours and that characteristic is used
in the
cosmetic industries. Henna leaves have property to react with different
chemicals
and form different variety of colours. Henna powder is a fully herbal
product.
Henna leaves produce variety of alka oxide, which forms color by aerial
oxidation Henna based dyes are made using herbal henna and other
nonhazardous
chemicals. Natural henna hair color is applied for the short period of
just 20
minutes to achieve a desired color. Henna based dyeing
products are
available in various colors such as Black (Kali Mehndi), Natural Black,
Dark
Brown, Special Brown, Light Brown, Chestnut, Sunset Orange, Auburn, Red
Wine,
Burgundy, Yellow, Blonde, Golden Bronze.
Henna
is a natural dye extracted from the dried and powdered
leaves, petioles and young shoots of the mignonette tree, or henna
shrub
(Lawsoniainermis). The natural dye is traditionally found in India,
Pakistan,
Middle East, and Northern Africa. When ground the dried leaves become a
greenish powder, but the dye is reddish to dark brown. Strong tea or
coffee,
lemon juice (or other acidic liquid) and essential oils (such as tea
tree, eucalyptus,
clove and lavender) can be used to release the dye from the powder.
The
dye can be mixed with water to make a paste with mud-like
consistency that will adhere well to the hair. The paste should be
allowed to
oxidize for a couple of hours before use. After the paste has been
applied to
the hair, it should stay on the hair as long as possible (usually for
about 1-3
hours)

Herbal Shampoo
       
Herbal
cosmetics have growing demand in the world market 
and are an invaluable gift of nature. There
are a wide range of herbal cosmetic products to satisfy beauty regime.
Adding
herbs in cosmetics is very safe for our skin. Herbal cosmetics are in
high
demand due to the increasing interest of mankind towards them because
they are
more effective with nil or less side effects, easily available
ingredients etc.
Shampoos
are probably the most
widely used cosmetic products for cleansing hairs and scalp in our
daily life.
A shampoo is basically a solution of a detergent containing suitable
additives
for other benefits such as hair-conditioning enhancement, lubrication,
medication etc. Now-a-days many synthetic, herbal, medicated and
nonmedicated
shampoos are available in the market but popularity of herbal shampoo
among
consumers is on rise because of their belief that these products being
of
natural origin are safe and free from side effects. Synthetic
surfactants are
added to shampoo primarily for the foaming and cleansing action but
their
regular use leads to dryness of hairs, hair loss, irritation to scalp
and eyes.

It
is used to wash and clean
hair. During old days very rough soaps and other materials were used to
wash
hair. The rough type of soaps contained major preparation of caustic
soda among
their constituents. No doubt these soaps had good cleaning power due to
caustic
content in the shape of saponific materials yet they spoil the human
skin by
their drastic action. This actually produced irritation and in some
itended in
the production of some skin disease like irritation, skin iteping and
also in
some cases gave rise to demodectic scabies.
A
good shampoo used to remove
surface grease, dirt and skin diseases from the hair and scalp without
affecting hair adversely. A good shampoo should cleanse hair and scalp
through
without stoning or irritation and should not remove too much of natural
oil
from the scalp. The success of shampoo is replacing a cake of soap lies
in the
fact that the shampoo is not only a detergent but a cosmetic as well as
that it
must import luster beauty and manageability.
 Herbal
Creams
      
Cosmetics
are substances used to enhance the appearance or odor of the human
body.
Cosmetics include skin-care creams, lotions, powders, perfumes,
lipsticks,
fingernail and toe nail polish, eye and facial makeup, permanent waves,
colored
contact lenses, hair colors, hair sprays and gels, deodorants, baby
products,
bath oils, bubble baths, bath salts, butters and many other types of
products.
Creams are as popular with males as with females. Herbal cosmetics have
growing
demand in the world market and are an invaluable gift of nature. There
are a
wide range of herbal cosmetic products to satisfy beauty regime. Herbal
cosmetics are in high demand due to the increasing interest of mankind
towards
them because they are more effective with nil or less side effects,
easily available
ingredients etc. not irritate the skin. If in addition, it can also
leave a
resideral emollient film on the skin, so much the belter.
Cleaning
cream, face cream and moisturizer and other lotions are used to clean
the skin
or face and throat. Before and after washing face and skin with water
we use it
to cure the skin. Generally it is very effective the oily skin. Oily
skin
causes the skin rough and creates pimples on the face. It also gives
moisturisation to the skin and also it is antiseptic.
In
use, a cleaning cream or lotion is spread onto the skin, using the
finger-tips,
and massaged onto the surface. This action serves to looses and suspend
the
grine and soil in the emulsion. A subsequent wipe with a tissue or
cotton wood
pad removes the majority of the applied cleansing emulsion and with it
the skin
soil, grain or make up. It should have a medium to high percentage oil
phase,
should be easily spreadable and should

Hand
Sanitizer
Hygiene is defined as maintenance
of cleanliness
practices which carries utmost importance in maintenance of health.
Hands
continue to play a major role in the transmission of infection in all
healthcare environments. Hand cleansing is the single most important
factor in
the prevention of infection and curbs the spread of potentially
pathogenic
organisms. Hand hygiene is one of the primary methods used to reduce
the
fecal-oral transmission of infectious agents. Hand sanitizers are
designed as a
personal care product to be used if soap and water are not available.
They
contain ingredients to help reduce the number of germs on the hand.
They are
not effective if hands have visible dirt on them. Frequent hand washing
is the
best way to avoid getting sick and spreading illness.
Hand
sanitizing does not
replace a proper hand washing technique. It should be used sparingly
and only
when soap and water are unavailable. It will be ineffective if hands
are
visibly soiled.
Many
people have the
misconception that their immediate environment must be germ free. Well,
this is
only possible in a true germ-free chamber in a lab or in certain
hospital
settings. We live in a natural world that is full of microorganisms,
living
things that cannot be seen by our bare eyes. While some of the
microorganisms
can cause illness or diseases, others can be essential to our
environment and
wellbeing. Although some microbes can cause food spoilage or diseases,
many of
them are a natural part of our foods and environments.
These
must be removed by the mechanical friction of washing with soap and
water or
destroyed by the use of antiseptic solutions.
The microorganisms from human and animal sources can be transmitted to
hands,
other people, foods, and anything else that the hand comes in contact
with and
vice versa. This is why good hand washing is important for reducing
harmful
microorganisms on our hands and for reducing the risk of transferring
harmful
microorganisms to others.
Proper
use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers requires that the product
contain 60% to 95% alcohol and that the amount of product applied to
the skin
be sufficient to keep the hands wet with the solution for the length of
time
specified on the manufacturer’s label, generally 15 seconds.
While
alcohol-based hand sanitizers are convenient carry-along products, they
are
expensive, toxic, and flammable.
