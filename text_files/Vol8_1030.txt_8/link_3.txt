7/8 inch Luffa Slices


                                The loofah, or luffa, is a wonderful, natural exfoliant. It begins as a gourd, and, once matured, is harvested, cleaned, and dehydrated. Our loofah slices are approximately 0.875" thick x 2.0"- 3.0" in circumference. Because Loofahs are a natural product, color and exact size will vary from gourd to gourd and crop to crop. Loofah slices are a great choice for embedding into a bar of melt and pour soap. Pre-cut loofah slices for soap making and utility sponges. Lather up and exfoliate at the same time! Loofah slices are also very convenient for the shower or to tuck into your toiletry bag on trips. Exfoliate, cleanse, revitalize, massage, relax! Customers who purchased Loofah Slices also purchased wholesale soap making supplies and bulk melt & pour soap bases.

Crafter's Choice™ Apricot Kernel Oil


                                Apricot Kernel Oil is a lightweight, quick absorbing oil right in linoleic and oleic acids. It is readily absorbed into the skin and makes an excellent massage oil. Apricot Kernel Oil has softening, moisturizing properties which make it ideal for dry, irritated, sensitive, or mature skin. Apricot Kernel Oil is a luxurious and conditioning oil in cold process and hot process soap. Our suggestion for usage of Apricot Kernel Oil in soap is 5% - 10%. Apricot Kernel oil is used quite often in many recipes for sea salt scrubs, sugar scrubs, lip gloss, lip balm, lotions, body butters, massage oils, and creams.   SAP VALUE: NaOH (bar soap): 0.135 |  KOH (liquid soap): 0.19  Color: slight yellow  Odor: no noticeable odor  Viscosity: light to medium  All Natural  Extraction Method: Cold Pressed. This extraction method yields higher quality Apricot Kernel Oil (more vitamins, minerals, etc.) compared to extraction methods which use chemicals and/or heat. Cold Pressed Apricot Kernel Oil is the highest quality oil you can buy.  Shelf life: 12 months from purchase  Customers who purchased Apricot Kernel Oil also purchased melt & pour soap bases, candle making supplies, labels for lip balm tins, lip balm flavors, and soap making ingredients.

                                Avocado Oil is a heavy, moisturizing oil rich in Vitamins A, B1, B5, D, E, minerals and protein. Because Avocado Oil is so rich, it makes wonderful massage oil and cold process soaps. Avocado Oil is a fantastic emollient with skin soothing properties making it a popular carrier oil in lip balms, lotions, sugar scrubs, dead sea salt scrubs, and body butters. Avocado Oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (it contains at least 75%), and these soften aging, dry or rough skin - it penetrates deeply so that nutrients can enter the dermis of the skin (under the epidermis). Recommended use in cold process soap is from 5% to 30%.   SAP VALUE: NaOH (bar soap): 0.134 |  KOH (liquid soap): 0.188  Color: green to yellow  Odor: Avocado Oil has a faint scent that is fatty and sweet  Viscosity: Slightly thicker than most carrier oils. Avocado Oil is a rich oil that may be diluted with other carrier oils to work its consistency   All Natural  Extraction Method: Cold Pressed. This extraction method yields a higher quality Avocado Oil (more vitamins, minerals, etc.) compared to extraction methods which use chemicals and/or heat. Cold Pressed Avocado Oil is the highest quality oil you can buy.  Shelf life: 12 months from purchase  Customers who purchased Avocado Oil also purchased melt & pour soap bases, candle making supplies, labels for lip balm tins, soap loaf molds, and soap making ingredients.

Crafter's Choice™ Babassu Oil


                                Derived from South American Babassu Palm trees, this oil has many of the same properties as coconut oil and can be used in place of coconut or palm oils in soaping or the creation of bath/body products.  Solid at room temperature, babassu oil will melt upon contact with skin and absorbs quickly, which makes it ideal for lotions, body butters, balms, hair products, and more.  Use up to 33% in your cold process soap recipes.  SAP VALUE: NaOH (bar soap): 0.17 |  KOH (liquid soap): 0.27  Melting Point: 76F  Color: clear to light yellow  Odor: odorless  Shelf Life: 2 years

Cocoa Butter, Refined & Deodorized


                                Cocoa Butter refined and deodorized. Cocoa Butter is a relatively hard saturated fat which can be used directly on the skin or incorporated into body care products. Cocoa Butter is used as an ingredient for lip balms, lip gloss, soaps, lotions, scrubs, and more. Our refined Cocoa Butter is conveniently packaged in chunk size pieces. Deodorized Cocoa Butter is used in conjunction with unsaturated oils like olive oil or castor oil (or with more sticky ingredients such as Shea butter and lanolin) when making soap. Cocoa Butter is one of the more stable fats and also contains natural antioxidants.  What does deodorized mean? Is there no more cocoa butter smell? Deodorized cocoa butter is used for its natural emollient properties and to bring stiffness to the end product. Because the material is deodorized there should be less interference with the desired fragrance of a finished product. There is still some fragrance left after the cocoa butter is deodorized.  If you need a fragrance free cocoa butter that will not compete with added fragrance then you will need to purchase a refined, bleached and deodorized cocoa butter without any aroma at all. This odorless product will be white instead of the buttery color of cocoa butter in its more natural state

Phenonip


                                Phenonip is a broad spectrum liquid preservative ideal for use in a wide variety of personal care formulations. Phenonip is oil soluble, can be used in emulsions and anhydrous formulations, and is effective in preventing bacteria, mold and fungal growth. It is a clear liquid and application rates vary from .3% to 1% by weight depending on the circumstances. Most applications work well within a .3% - .5% range. To preserve 200g of salt scrub at .5% application rate would mean using approximately 1g of Phenonip. This preservative was designed with cosmetics in mind and is especially effective when used in conjunction with oil based products but also works extremely well in aqueous solutions up to a .5% application rate. Phenonip can also tolerate higher temperatures than many other preservatives and still maintain its effectiveness.  Recommended usage: .3% - 1%  Appearance: Clear liquid  Formaldehyde free  Customers who purchased Phenonip preservative also purchased melt and pour soap bases, soap molds, candle making supplies, and lip balm labels.

Crafter's Choice™ Sodium Lactate 60%


                                Sodium Lactate is an effective natural moisturizer and humectant which can increase moisture retention and studies show it can be a better moisturizer than glycerin.  Ideal for use in cold process soaps, hot process soaps, shampoos, and lotions. Soap made with sodium lactate is smoother and harder. Commonly used to help soap release more quickly and easily from the mold.  Our Sodium Lactate is biodegradable, produced from renewable resources: liquid salt derived from fermented corn or beet sugar.   Use up to 1/2 ounce per pound of oils/butters in soaps. Testing is recommended to find the perfect usage rate for your application.  Use up to 5% for body care such as lotions. You can replace the glycerin in your recipe with sodium lactate.  Not recommend for use in M&P soap bases or other products like bath bombs.  Appearance: Colorless to light yellow liquid  Odor: Odorless  Shelf life: 2 years

Crafter's Choice™ Sweet Almond Oil - Refined


                                Sweet Almond Oil is a luxurious, light, non-greasy, moisturizing oil which easily absorbs into the skin and is known for its natural warming effect on sore muscles. Sweet Almond Oil is frequently used in lip balm recipes, lip gloss, massage oils, lotions, sugar scrubs, Dead Sea salt scrubs, bath bombs, and soap recipes. Sweet Almond Oil is also renowned for its rich concentration of oleic and linoleic essential fatty acids which help to give it exceptional penetrating and restructuring properties. Sweet Almond Oil also makes an unparalleled carrier for salt (for use in salt scrubs). In soap, Sweet Almond Oil produces a low, stable lather, but because it is not a hard oil (it is liquid at room temperature), we recommend not using more than about 5% - 10% in soap recipes.   SAP VALUE: NaOH (bar soap): 0.14 |  KOH (liquid soap): 0.21  Melting Point: liquid at room temp  Color: golden yellow to pale yellow  Odor: slight aroma  Viscosity: medium  All Natural  Extraction Method: Cold Pressed. This extraction method yields higher quality oil (more vitamins, minerals, etc.) compared to extraction methods which use chemicals and/or heat. Cold Pressed Sweet Almond Oil is the highest quality oil you can buy.  Shelf life: 12 months from purchase  Customers who purchased Sweet Almond Oil also purchased melt & pour soap bases, candle making supplies, soap colorant, Dead Sea Salt, and soap making ingredients.
