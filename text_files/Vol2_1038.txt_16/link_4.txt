Reviews




A combination of skin care, makeup and sunscreen, this dynamic do it all DD cream softens, smoothens and gives you a naturally luminous skin. It locks in moisture, leaving you with healthy, younger-looking skin. Beige colored cream that perfectly blends on all types and color of the skin. It is easily absorbs by your skin that will instantly gives you a naturally luminous skin.
Sunscreen (Titanium Dioxide & Zinc Oxide): Used in products that are applied to the skin to absorb, reflect or scatter UV rays; it protects the skin from sunburn and other damaging effects of the sun. Niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. It improves skin's elasticity, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.
 Sodium Hyaluronate: A moisture retaining ingredient. Sodium Hyaluronate is the salt form of Hyaluronic Acid, a water-binding ingredient that has the ability to fill the spaces between the connective fibers known as collagen and elastin. Hyaluronic Acid is often injected into the skin (on the face most often), and hydrates and separates the skin, allowing it to retain water and create a plumping effect. Sodium Hyaluronate has been used for moisturization and wound healing since its discover in the 1930s. According to DermaDoctor.com, it is comprised of small molecules that penetrate the skin easily, and can hold up to 1000 their own weight in water. Because the skin naturally loses its water composition as it ages (going from 10% - 20% water to less than 10%), Hyaluronic Acid and Sodium Hyaluronate can replace some of the water lost in the dermis, and potentially fight wrinkles and other signs of aging.
Adenosine: Adenosine penetrates deeply into the skin to help prevent wrinkles, reduce UV B sun damage. It is particularly effective for peri orbital wrinkles( crow’s feet) and glabellar ( forehead) frown lines. It has been shown to enhance the effects of botox in facial wrinkle reduction. Adenosine increases the production of dermal fibroblast proteins ( elastin and collagen) reducing skin sagginess and improving tone. It also increases blood flow to the outer layers of skin improving damage repair and cell volume resulting in a fuller appearance.                      
Hyaluronic Acid, its Salts and variations (Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate) - are naturally-occurring substance in skin known for its stunning capacity to attract and hold onto 1000x its weight in moisture. It works overtime by replenishing skin to enhance a healthy, supple look and feel.
