Description
Chroma-Lite® Series – For Luster and Transparency
Chroma-Lite Colors contain bismuth oxychloride crystals deposited on mica platelets. These high-value composite pigments combine the performance benefits of both materials to give better transparency and less density than bismuth oxychloride alone. The mica substrate improves crystal strength, so less Pearlescence is lost as cosmetic products are processed. They offer an excellent balance of luster, transparency, and color while imparting a silky feel and improving skin adhesion. They are ideal for mineral makeup.
