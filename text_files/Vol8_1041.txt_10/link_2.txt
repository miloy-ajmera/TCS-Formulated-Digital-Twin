ACUDYNE™ SCP Hair Styling Conditioning Polymer Description

THE CHALLENGE… In today’s hair styling products, there is a trade-off between good hold and great feel. Current ingredients offer strong hold, but do not impart a natural feel, often causing dullness and noticeably increased flaking.

THE SOLUTION... Introducing ACUDYNE SCP – Styling Conditioning Polymer Developed specifically for high-performance hair styling products, ACUDYNE SCP delivers: Tunable Hold

Get the hold you want - from soft to strong.

Conditioned Feel

Unique conditioning polymers leave hair feeling natural and soft to the touch.

Shine

Incorporate shine to the hair without additives.

High Humidity Style Retention

Superior style retention even at high humidity levels.

Non-flaking

Critical non-flaking properties.

Non-sticky Style

Great style control without stickiness on wet or dry hair.

Features and Mechanism ACUDYNE SCP is a novel anionic polymer for hair gels, mousses, lotions, puttys, and pomades. Supplied as a preneutralized aqueous solution, ACUDYNE SCP enables firm hold, conditioned hair feel, superior humidity resistance — and all without flaking. Benefit

Enabling Mechanism

Tunable Hold

Anionic polymer chemistry designed to hydrogen bond and adhere to the hair fiber. This combined with dual Tg, (glass transition temperature), gives firm hold to the hair.

Conditioned Feel on Hair

Designed so that slight hydration provides a conditioned feel. Enables a simpler formula with better clarity.

Shine

Simple formula means less buildup on the hair to detract from shine, and uniform film enhances hair shine.

Non-flaking

Self plasticized polymer eliminates flaking.

Formulation Compatibility (Blend partners)

Compatible with ACULYN™ and Carbopol™ rheology modifiers. Compatible with selected cationic additives, PVP, PVP/VA.

Chemical and Physical Properties ACUDYNE SCP is a linear anionic terpolymer of acrylamide, acrylamidomethyl propanesulfonic acid (sodium salt), and methacrylic acid. It is supplied pre-neutralized and is water soluble. It is manufactured as a low viscosity solution in water. It is easy to formulate into liquids or gels without any further neutralization.

 Film Properties The ACUDYNE SCP polymer has two glass transition temperatures (Tg), caused by hydration of the polymer film (Figure 1). This duality imparts a self-plasticizing characteristic. The plasticized phase eliminates flaking, and the non-plasticized phase maintains hold under high humidity conditions. Figure 2 shows that the ACUDYNE SCP film has a significantly higher resistance to deform (modulus value) versus a PVP film at 55% relative humidity. This indicates a more humidity resistant film when exposed to humidity.

 Hair Gel Application Data High Humidity and Style Retention Hair treated with ACUDYNE SCP gel shows excellent humidity resistance versus commercial hair fixative resins and commercially available hair gels.

Distinctive Hair Aesthetics Superior Styling and Conditioned Feel Salon tests demonstrate that ACUDYNE SCP delivers superior wet feel and combing versus a PVP-based commercial gel. Hair treated with the ACUDYNE SCP gel is also less sticky than with the PVP-based commercial gel.

 Shine Scanning electron microscope pictures illustrate a simple hair gel with ACUDYNE SCP provides the smoothest coating to the hair shaft when compared to both the PVP-based gels, and equivalent performance vs. a polyquatbased commercial gel. There is no flaking, and no detraction from shine.

 Non-flaking ACUDYNE SCP does not flake on the hair, even without plasticizer in the formulation.

 Salon Evaluation ACUDYNE SCP Gel (Ultra-Stiff Hair Gel) vs. Leading Commercial Styling Gel) Test Conditions Half-head salon studies were conducted on eleven female subjects at CRL Labs, New Jersey, USA. Test Method Pre-test evaluation included assessments of the type, texture and length of the hair, pre-treatment of the hair and the condition of the hair and scalp. The cosmetologist then shampooed the hair with a clarifying shampoo. The hair was then parted in the middle to define the two test sites after which the gels were applied to the hair in accordance with computer generated randomization. During application, the cosmetologist evaluated the parameters for wet evaluation, which included ease of product spreading, product consistency, wet feel, wet combing/force to comb, coating/residue, tackiness and styling ease. After completing the application and wet evaluations for both sides of the head, the cosmetologist dried and styled the hair. Cosmetologist evaluated the dry parameters, which included shine, combability, dust flaking, stiffness of film, degree of tackiness, body/manageability, volume/fullness, and overall appearance. Further, the subjects were given a take home questionnaire to evaluate the hold properties of each test material four to six hours post-treatment. Results Wet Evaluation on Hair

Health and Safety Profile The ACUDYNE SCP polymer was tested in a number of non-clinical and clinical tests to evaluate potential hazards associated with handling and use of the material in personal care applications. Overall Evaluation ACUDYNE SCP was non-toxic by a single oral or dermal dose, produced minimal to slight irritation to the eyes and skin, was non-irritating and non-sensitizing in a human patch report, and was non-mutagenic in the Ames assay This material is safe and appropriate for use in a broad range of personal care applications.
