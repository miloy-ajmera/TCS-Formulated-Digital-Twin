            Natural Waxes
        

When creating a cosmetic, thickness and consistency are key. Most consumers are responsive to the tactile feel of a product, and there are many ingredients you can use to modulate that. Our natural waxes products are one common way to alter the viscosity of a product, as well as enhance the shelf-life. Waxes are blends of fatty acids, alcohols, and esters. Compared to straight fats, waxes are less greasy, more brittle, and harder in texture. Because of their unique properties, waxes are great at creating moisture barriers, as well as resisting oxidation and microbial growth.
Waxes have been used for body applications for thousands of years, and these compounds are great at boosting a product’s staying power. Because waxes create a moisture barrier, they make wonderful additions to moisturizers, ointments, and balms—basically, anything that you want to stick to the skin to prevent it from drying out.
Here at MakingCosmetics, we carry a wide range of cosmetic ingredients online, including a huge selection of natural wax products. These wax ingredients are often used in cosmetic products like face creams, lip balms, mascaras, deodorants, and balms. We offer many options for waxes that can blend well with other ingredients such as oils, butters, flavorings, scents, and more. Our online store contains natural waxes such as beeswax and sunflower wax, as well as more specialized waxes, including vegan and non-GMO options!
If you are looking for an ingredient that has protectant, emollient, thickening, and film-forming properties, look no further than our lineup of cosmetic waxes. These are key components in a great range of formulas, and our team of chemists can assist you in using them to enhance your product line. MakingCosmetics not only stocks a huge selection of cosmetic ingredients, but we also have many wonderful resources on formulations, regulations, how to get started making your products, and much more.
Check out our natural cosmetic and beauty product waxes below, and reach out to us if you need help selecting the right one for you!
