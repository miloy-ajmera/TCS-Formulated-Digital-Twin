Humectant Ingredients or Chemicals 
Description of Humectant: humectants are hygroscopic ingredients that pull in moisture from their surroundings. This can be from the air, but also from underlying layers of the skin. Humectants are a type of moisturizer & emollient with the same effect as occlusive ingredients, however humectants pull in moisture, while occlusives form a barrier to keep the skin moist. Humectants are commonly added to Personal Care products, predominantly in Skin Care products, where they can be used to keep the skin hydrated and looking healthy. In the Pharmaceutical industry, humectants are added to some topical formulations to improve the solubility of specific active ingredients. Examples of humectants include D-Panthenol75, IngrePol Glycereth-26 or IngrePol PEG-1500S.

Item #: 2220



Hemp Seed Oil is a green oil, cold pressed from Cannabis Sativa or hemp seeds. It should not be confused with oils made from the leaves, flowers and stalks from the same hemp plant, but instead the Hemp Seed Oil is made exclusively from the seeds, which do not contain pyscho active elements. Hemp Seed Oil has many benefits when used in skin and body care formulations because the nutritional elements in the hemp seeds are retained by cold pressing. The vitamins and fatty acids provide anti-inflammatory properties. This also makes Hemp Seed Oil a great addition for anti-aging formulations. Hemp Seed Oil can be used in a wide variety of body, hair and skin care formulations.
