        Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Recently, several studies demonstrate the possible role of zinc oxide (ZnO) in the protection of several skin diseases, but less is known about the role of ZnO nanoparticles in the inflammatory skin disease. So, this study was designed to confirm the pivotal role of the nano zinc oxide cream in the alleviation of lead oxide (PbO) induced-allergic dermatitis in rats.
    


          Materials and methods:
        
      
      Two concentrations (1% and 6%) of ZnONPs creams were prepared and characterized prior to being used in the study. A total number of 30 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups. Group 1 (negative control), groups 2&3 (either 1% or 6% ZnONPs control groups), group 4 (PbO), groups 5&6 (co-treatment of each ZnONPs concentration+PbO). All rats in different groups were observed daily to determine the severity of dermal gross lesions. Histopathological studies, mRNA analysis, and oxidative stress evaluations were performed on the affected skin tissue. Immunohistochemical studies were performed to evaluate the expression of cluster of differentiation CD4, CD8 and intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 in different groups.
    


          Results:
        
      
      PbO caused extensive skin oxidative damage manifested by a significant increase in MDA level with a decrease in GSH content and CAT activity. The results of histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed that topical application of PbO for 14 days led to severe allergic dermatitis with remarkable elevations in the number of CD4+ T-helper, CD8+ T-cytotoxic lymphocytes, and ICAM-1 expression. On the other hand, noticeable improvements were recorded in all the previous toxicopathological parameters among the groups treated by either 1% or 6% ZnO-NPs cream. However, the best results were observed in the group treated with 1% ZnO-NPs cream.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our findings suggest that 1% of ZnO-NPs cream is safe when applied topically on the inflamed skin. Moreover, it had anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects so that, it is recommended to use the 1% ZnO-NPs cream to avert the dermal toxicity-induced by PbO.
