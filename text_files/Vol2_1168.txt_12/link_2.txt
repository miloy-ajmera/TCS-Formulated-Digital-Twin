Titanium Dioxide


















Titanium Dioxide









Choosing a sunscreen with gentle, yet effective ingredients for all skin types—including babies' skin and sensitive skin—is a key step in protecting your skin against sun damage. Mineral-based sunscreens commonly contain titanium dioxide (along with zinc oxide) because of this ingredient’s ability to reflect and scatter damaging UVA and UVB rays off the skin’s surface.

 
CeraVe offers an array of mineral sunscreens containing titanium dioxide, including hydrating sunscreen lotions for your face and body, formulas specially designed for babies, and water-resistant sunscreen sticks for touch-ups on the go. Every CeraVe SPF sunscreen product is non-greasy, helps prevent sunburn, and contains three essential ceramides to help restore the skin's protective barrier and lock in moisture.











Important Things to Know about Titanium Dioxide 




Titanium dioxide is used in mineral-based sunscreens to help reflect and scatter UVA and UVB rays. Because titanium dioxide can help prevent sunburn and sun damage, SPF products with this ingredient can generally be used by all skin types looking to protect their skin from the sun.





Unlike chemical sunscreen, which is formulated with ingredients to absorb damaging sun rays, titanium dioxide sunscreen works by forming a protective barrier on your skin. Because of its ability to reflect the sun’s rays, titanium dioxide is often used in mineral sunscreen products as an effective way to help protect the skin from UVA and UVB damage.





 Sunscreen products that are formulated with titanium dioxide can be used for effective sun protection on both the face and body. To get the most out of your mineral sunscreen routine, it’s important to follow the instructions on the label closely and incorporate additional protective measures, such as seeking shade or wearing protective clothing.





Titanium dioxide is an inert mineral that is generally recognized as safe for daily use as part of a well-rounded routine for healthy-looking skin. When in doubt, visit a dermatologist for individualized advice on the right sun protection products for your skin.
