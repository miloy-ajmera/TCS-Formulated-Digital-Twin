This cream is great
When I was about 17, my mother gave me my first jar of Pond's cold cream. She always put it on before bed as long as I could remember. She told me to always put it on to take off makeup & then put more on to wear overnight. I am now in my 70s & still use it every night. I am lucky enough to have good genes (parents had no wrinkles until they were well into their 70s) plus this cold cream & I truly have few wrinkles on my face or neck.

Excellent product!
I have been using the original Ponds cream for 76 years. I am now 96 and every one tells me my skin is beautiful. Thank you for maintaining your excellent product for over 70 years!

Love the fragrance free option!!!
I love the original cold cream, but I am so happy that Ponds developed a fragrance free version. Skin is clean, soft, and calm. Perfect for my sensitive skin. I massage it in to breakdown my makeup then remove with a warm wet washcloth. This removes all traces of makeup and gently exfoliates. Now if only they would make the dry skin moisturizer in a fragrance free option.

Classic Skin Care That Still Works Excellently
This product is a classic that removes any and all kinds of makeup: From mascara to foundation, you can rely on it to leave your face clean, hydrated and smooth.
I apply Pond's Cold Cream, work in a circular motion over my face, wipe off the makeup with tissue and wash with a mild cleanser and wash cloth. My 50 plus sensitive complexion is clean, calm plus looks smooth and radiant. Thank you for a wonderful product!

Best makeup remover ever
I find this product is safe to remove all kinds of makeup (even tough to remove waterproof mascara). It very easily removes all my makeup and I have no irritation or side effects. I’ve tried all kinds of gentle facial makeup removal wipes, but they sting my eyes and leave the skin around my eyes uncomfortable. The Ponds Cold Cream Cleanser takes off all my makeup without any issues and my skin feels great!

Amazing!!
I use this product everyday and I love it so much! I have very sensitive skin and when I’ve used the original scented version I got cystic pimples and a rash. The fragrance free formula doesn’t bother my skin at all! Please don’t ever discontinue!!

Amazing Stuff!
I really adore using this product as a stand-alone facial cleanser, facial cleanser+makeup remover, and as a moisturizer too. It is very multi-purpose, which I really like. It has no noticeable scent to it, it doesn’t break me out, and as someone with eczema, I do find it to be very helpful towards better keeping my eczema under control. I do prefer to remove the cleanser from off of my face with a wet washcloth. After I remove it, my skin is never left feeling stripped or irritated at all, only clean and soft to the touch. I would highly recommend buying this product and adding it into your skincare regimen whether you happen to be a teenager or adult. It’s super affordable, highly accessible to get, and most of all your skin will definitely end up thanking you for it for sure.
