New Gene Expression Study Results
An in-vitro gene expression study was conducted on artificial skin to demonstrate a change to key genes when they were exposed to HEV light. The exposure to HEV light affected genes with the following:

•	Inflammatory response 
•	Barrier disruption 
•	Aging at the cellular level affecting normal cell cycle and death patterns  (apoptosis and senescence) 
•	Melanogenesis leading to uneven pigmentation

These changes were then prevented by the use of  Liposhield® HEV Melanin.
