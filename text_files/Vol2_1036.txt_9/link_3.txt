It combines the substantive conditioning of an amino silicone with the low yellowing and ease of formulation of a silicone glycol. DOWSIL™ 8500 Conditioning Agent has demonstrated superior conditioning effects on hair due to its unique chemical structure. This unique chemical structure allows for the combined benefits of a hydrophobic material with the ease of formulation with no additional solubilizers. It is for use in clear and opaque conditioning shampoos, colorants semi-permanent and permanent, leave-in conditioning treatments (detangler, split end repair, hot oil, hair mask, mousses), anhydrous systems (fixatives, leave on, etc.) and hydrous systems (i.e. rinse-off conditioners). view less

                            DOWSIL™ FZ-2233 is an ABn silicone polyether block copolymer, non-diluted material. Its primary function is to produce water-in-silicone and water-in-silicone and oil emulsions with a creamy and rich appearance but leaving a light, non-greasy after feel on the skin. The addition level can be as low as 1% leaving a lot of flexibility for the oil phase composition. The emulsions have also a small particle size resulting in highly stable emulsions at elevated temperatures but also through several freeze thaw cycles. view less

                            XIAMETER® PMX-1184 Silicone Fluid is a low molecular weight siloxane polymer. The bulk of composition falls between 1 and 2cSt with some higher molecular components, which may enhance solubility and/or sensory benefits. Unlike other volatile carriers, it does not cool the skin when it evaporates. This cost effective, linear silicone fluid is non-staining on fabric and can be used to reduce whiteness and tack in antiperspirants and deodorants formulations. It can also be used as a substantive in hair care applications and to impart a pleasant skin feel in skin care products. view less
