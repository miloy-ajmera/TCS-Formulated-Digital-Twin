It is well known that anionic thickeners such as carbomer and related polymers are generally incompatible with cationic ingredients. Combining carbomers with quaternary compounds or other cationic ingredients often leads to viscosity instability and high turbidity. In addition, the carbomer and quat can strongly interact resulting in the precipitation of a white, gummy mass. This has limited the formulators’ options for novel rheological properties in rinse-out conditioners. It has also restricted the choice of rheology modifiers that can be used when creating gel-based styling products that contain quaternary conditioning agents, resulting in products with less than optimal aesthetic properties. However, when quats are first complexed with anionic functional organosilicones, they can be successfully combined with carbomers and related polymers. Because complexation with an anionic silicone apparently shields the cationic material from the anionic polymer, one might expect interference with the ability of the cationic material to deposit on anionic hair. Such interference would negatively affect conditioning properties such as wet comb-through, which is generally improved by the addition of low molecular weight (MW) quats. Complexing low molecular weight quats with anionic silicone does not, however, reduce the deposition of the quat onto hair. In fact, it can actually serve to increase the deposition of silicone onto hair, thereby improving conditioning properties.Interesting StoriesEvent Coverage15+ Trends in Cosmetics Innovation at in-cosmetics Global 2023SponsoredAURIST™ AGC: A novel biodegradable, cationic hair conditioning biopolymerFormulating BasicsRead the Label: CeraVe Daily Moisturizing LotionResearch2023 Skin Care Ingredient TrendsSafetyMercury-contaminated Cosmetics Make Headlines, Raise Consumer AlertSafetyUnilever, J&J, Olaplex and L'Oreal Still Treading Legal Waters Over Lilial, BenzeneConsumers/Market3 TikTok Meta Trends: Barrier Cream, Lip Oil and Glowing SunscreenSponsoredCircular beauty through upcyclingMore in Rheology/ThickenerSponsoredV/WA™, discover Alteromonas lipotrueaeDiscover V/WA™ a fully vertically integrated active ingredient from a new identified Alteromonas strain: Alteromonas lipotrueae.Apr 12th, 2023Event CoverageCosmetics & Toiletries Allēs Present Innovation MeritsIn addition to the overall Cosmetics & Toiletries Allē Award winners, the following innovation merits were presented to entries receiving the highest score for a specific parameter in their given category.Sep 29th, 2022Event CoverageWhich Base Ingredient Will Win the C&T Allē Award?Which base ingredient will win the Cosmetics & Toiletries Allē Award?
