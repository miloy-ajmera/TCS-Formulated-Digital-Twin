Ivermectin Lotion, 0.5%Lice Treatment Lotion




THE FACTS OF LICE


Please read all information before using Ivermectin Lotion.


If you or a member of your household has head lice, don't panic. Keep calm.

Anyone can get head lice – it has nothing to do with cleanliness or poor hygiene. Head lice are treatable and very rarely cause serious health problems.

What are head lice?


Head lice are small insects that live and feed on the human scalp.
They may get as big as sesame seeds and are brown.
Lice do not fly or jump from one person to another. They can only crawl.


What are nits?


Nits are lice eggs laid on the hair near the scalp. One louse may lay over 100 nits.
Nits are oval shaped, tiny and greyish-white.
They are attached to hair with a waterproof glue-like substance that cannot be washed out or blown away.


How do head lice spread?


Head lice spread easily from close head-to-head or hand-to-head contact with persons who have lice.
They may also be spread by sharing hats, helmets, scarves, headphones, brushes, combs, bedding and clothing.


How do you know if you have lice?


Itching is the most common symptom.
Scratching behind the ears or the back of the neck is a sign that you should check for head lice.
Scabs or blood spots may be seen.


How do you prevent the spread of lice?


Avoid direct head-to-head contact with anyone known to have live, crawling lice.
Do not share combs, brushes, hats, scarves, bandannas, ribbons, barrettes, hair bands, towels, helmets, or other hair-related personal items with anyone else, whether they have lice or not.
Avoid sleepovers and slumber parties during lice outbreaks.
Lice can live in bedding, pillows, and carpets that have recently been used by someone with lice.

Why is DailyMed no longer displaying pill images on the Search Results and Drug Info pages?


                Due to inconsistencies between the drug labels on DailyMed and the pill images provided by RxImage, we no longer display the RxImage pill images associated with drug labels.
            

                We anticipate reposting the images once we are able identify and filter out images that do not match the information provided in the drug labels.
