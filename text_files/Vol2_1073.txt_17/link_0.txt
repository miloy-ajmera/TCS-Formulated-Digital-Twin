1.       Abstract1.1.  Background: Compromised skin
barrier is a major driver of skin diseases such as psoriasis. We hypothesized
that Yolk Lecithin Liposomes (YLLs) being water soluble bi-lipid membrane
vesicles rich in skin barrier lipid and their precursors would be efficient in enhancing skin barrier. We tested
this hypothesis by applying YLLs topically to
Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model of psoriasis for evidence of skin
barrier protection against IMQ and alleviation of the disease phenotype.1.2.  Materials and Methods: 100 nm
YLLs were first tested for effects on human MSC proliferation, collagen
production in human dermal fibroblasts and penetration into human skin. They were then tested for efficacy
in enhancing skin barrier against IMQ infiltration in a psoriasis mouse model. After
6 daily topical applications of IMQ and then a cream with YLLs or cream alone,
barrier efficacy was assessed by the severity of psoriatic symptoms and
cytokine induction in the skin lesion.1.3.  Results: YLLs are
non-toxic, and can enhance cell proliferation and collagen production. They
readily permeated the stratum corneum. They alleviated psoriatic skin pathology
and reduced IL-23 and TNF-a in
the skin lesion of an IMQ-induced psoriasis mouse model.1.4.  Conclusion: YLLs are effective
in enhancing the skin barrier as evidenced by the alleviation of IMQ-induced
psoriasis.

Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis on a Zetaview over a size range of 5 to 1000 nm at 25°C. (B) YLLs as observed under TEM.Figures 2(A-B):
Cellular growth promotion and uptake of YLLs (A) (Left panel) Immortalized
human mesenchymal stem cells (E1-MYC) were cultured in a Chemically Defined Medium (CDM)
with increasing YLL concentration (mM PC) over 5 days. Cell proliferation was
assessed by MTS assay. Data are presented as mean ±
SD, * P<
0.05 as compared to control (0 mM PC) by Student’s t-test. (Right panel) Phase contrast
images of cells treated with 0.025 mM PC and without YLLs (vehicle). Scale bar
= 100 µm. (B)
E1-MYC cells
were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled YLLs for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours. The
control was cells that were not incubated with the labeled YLLs. The cells were
analysed by flow cytometry. Histogram represents a plot of fluorescence
intensity against number of events
(cells).Figures 3(A-C): YLLs
increased collagen production in dermal fibroblasts(A) Phase contrast
images of primary human dermal fibroblasts cultured in the presence of vehicle, 0.25 mM PC YLLs, 0.1% or 1% Matrixyl,
fixed and stained with picro-sirius red solution to visualize collagen.
Scale bar = 100 µm. (B) Collagen content per cell in each culture was normalized to
that in untreated control. Collagen
content per cell was determined by normalizing the amount of stain in each
culture against cell numbers by MTS assay. Data are presented as mean ± SD(C) Cell
numbers relative to untreated control, as estimated by MTS assay. Data are
presented as mean ± SDFigures 4(A-B):
Topical application of YLLs on skin organ culture. Human skin organ
culture was topically treated with PBS (Control) or Alexa Fluor 488-labeled
YLLs, washed, frozen in OCT medium and sectioned. (A) H&E staining with arrowheads indicating position of stratum
corneum. Scale bar = 100 µm. (B) Fluorescence imaging of sections
counterstained with DAPI (blue). White broken lines denote epidermal-dermal
junction. Scale bar = 50 µm.Figures 5 (A-D): Topical
application of YLLs on an IMQ-induced mouse model of psoriasis. IMQ was applied to the shaved backs and
right ears of mice from day 0 to day 5. This was followed by the liposome
cream, base cream (vehicle control), or 3 mg/Kg dexamethasone, i.p.
(positive control). (A) Weight of
mice over six days of study;(B) The
spleen from each mouse was removed, weighed and the ratio of spleen to body
weight for each mouse was calculated; (C)
Erythema, scaling, and thickness in each mouse were determined daily on a scale
from 0 to 4, and combined to generate the cumulative score; (D)The back skin of each mouse was
harvested on day 6, homogenized and the homogenized solution was assayed for
TNF-α, IL-17and IL-23 by ELISA. Data are
presented as mean ± SE, * P< 0.05.
