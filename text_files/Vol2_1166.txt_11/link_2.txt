VEEGUM® HV Magnesium Aluminum Silicate provides excellent emulsion and suspension stability at low use levels.  VEEGUM HV is used in API lotions, creams and suspensions with pH >6, as well as in treatment shampoos.  It can also be used as a tablet binder/disintegrant and tablet release regulator in tablets formed through wet granulation.  VEEGUM HV can be used for taste masking.
VEEGUM HV is a highly purified smectite clay suspension stabilizer, emulsion optimizer and rheology modifier.  VEEGUM HV also reduces the slippery or sticky feel of gums and polymers, while providing a silky, tack-free feel in topical preparations.  This smectite clay is synergistic with common thickeners such as VANZAN® xanthan gum and CMC.  These combinations will provide greater thickening, stabilizing and suspending properties than those developed by the individual components of the mixture.
Typical Use Levels: Between 0.5% and 3%
INCI Name: Magnesium Aluminum Silicate
VEEGUM HV is Magnesium Aluminum Silicate NF Type IC
USP/NF monographed VEEGUM® Magnesium Aluminum Silicate clays, including VEEGUM HV, are intended for oral, topical, and dental use only.  These products are not intended for other uses, such as parenteral, inhalation, or ophthalmic.
