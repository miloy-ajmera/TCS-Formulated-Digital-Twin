Description
AEROSIL® R 812 S: AEROSIL®  fumed silica has many applications in hair care products, particularly Dry Shampoo, providing an easy alternative to time-consuming wet washing and drying. Combined with other powder ingredients, AEROSIL® provides a volumizing effect to styling aids, and since Dry Water contains mostly an aqueous phase by weight, the formulation also moisturizes the hair.
AEROSIL® R 812 S provides effective rheology control in complex liquid systems.
Applications

Cosmetics

Dry Water Concept
Water or dilute aqueous solutions can be converted to a dry powder with the help of superhydrophobic AEROSIL® R 812. The powdery product can contain up to
95 % w/w of an aqueous phase. Under mechanical stress, for example, when the product is rubbed onto the skin, the water is released. In this way, solutions containing vitamins, plant extracts and/or other active ingredients can be converted to powdered products. “Dry Water” is created by producing fine water droplets in the presence of the hydrophobic AEROSIL® during a high shear mixing process. While mixing the fine water droplets are coated by the hydrophobic silica which prevents the water droplets from coalescing.
