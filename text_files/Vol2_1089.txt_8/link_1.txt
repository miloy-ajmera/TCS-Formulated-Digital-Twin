Skin is maximum human organ.Many functions (for example being used for thermoregulation and sensing organ) at skin prevent that the exsiccant barriers function of skin (and then whole organ) from may be most important.Simultaneously, skin penetrates and absorbs the armour of exterior materials as opposing.This barriers function is undertaken by epidermis, and epidermis is in outermost layer, has formed the real protection shell of opposing environment.At about 1/10 gross thickness place, also be the thin layer of skin.Epidermis is stratified tissue, wherein constitutes the pith of barriers function as outer field horny layer.
Except the barriers function of resisting outside chemistry and physical influence, the epidermis lipoid also helps horny layer to be kept together and have the effect that makes skin smooth.Compare with sebaceous gland lipoid (it does not form successive film on skin), the lipoid of epidermis is distributed on the whole horny layer.
The utmost point complex interactions of preserving moisture between the lipoid of the material and the skin the superiors is crucial for regulating humidity of skin.Therefore, cosmetics also contain the material of bound water usually except equilibrated lipid mixture and water.
But except chemical composition, the physical property of these materials also is important.So need exploitation extraordinary emulsifying agent of biocompatibility and surfactant.Product with these material preparations can help the liquid crystal systematism of cuticular iuntercellular lipoid, thereby improves cuticular barrier property.Particularly advantageous is that their branch subconstiuent is included in naturally occurring material in the epidermis.
The cosmetics skin protection is interpreted as that mainly the natural functions of the barrier that expression skin loses as opposing environmental effect (for example dust, chemicals, microorganism) and opposing endogenous substance (for example water, natural fat, electrolyte) is enhanced or recovers.The damage of this function can cause the absorption of toxicity or pungent to increase, or is subjected to the attack of microorganism, and causes toxicity or dermoreaction hypersensitive subsequently.
Another purpose of skin protection the skin oil and fat that to be compensation caused by every day washing and the loss of moisture.When natural regeneration capacity was not enough, this was a particular importance.In addition, skin-protection product should prevent environmental effect, particularly resists sunlight and wind, and postpones skin aging.
The medicine topical formulations comprises the medicine of one or more valid density usually.For the clear difference between cosmetics and medicinal usage and the corresponding product, can be referring to the legal provisions of Federal Republic ofGermany (for example Cosmetic Ordinance, Foods and Drugs Act).
Emulsion
Emulsion is conventional cosmetics type of service.Emulsion is generally understood as the heterogeneous system of two kinds of liquid of expression, and these two kinds of liquid are unmixing or only miscible on limited extent each other, and they are commonly referred to phase.A kind of liquid is the form (decentralized photo) of drop, and another kind of liquid forms (combination) continuously phase.
If two kinds of liquid are water and oil, and oil droplet carefully is distributed in the water, then is called emulsion oil-in-water (O/W emulsion, for example milk).The basic feature of O/W emulsion is determined by water.On the other hand, if water droplet is present in the oil with finely divided form, then be called water-in-oil emulsion (W/O emulsion), its basic feature is determined by oil.
Not too common application form is a multiple emulsion.These are interpreted as the emulsion that expression is such: in the drop of decentralized photo (or discontinuous phase), their part drop constitutes another decentralized photo, for example W/O/W emulsion or O/W/O emulsion.
In order to guarantee the metastability of emulsion, must use interfacial activity material, i.e. emulsifying agent usually.(the being non-multiple emulsion) liquid-drop diameter of conventional " simply " is about 1-50 micron.Do not having under the situation of other color additive, this " macroscopical emulsion " is milky and opaque.Do not having under the situation of other color additive equally, liquid-drop diameter is about 10
          -1-1 micron thinner " macroscopical emulsion " is blue and white and opaque.This " macroscopical emulsion " has high viscosity usually.
        
Particle diameter is less than about 10
          -2The micelle and the molecular solution of micron are as clear as crystal, but no longer are considered to genuine milk liquid.
        
Microemulsion is optical isotropy, thermodynamically stable system, and it contains water-fast oil ingredient, emulsifying agent and water.Limpid or the transparent appearance of microemulsion is because the particle diameter of dispersive emulsion droplets is little.The liquid-drop diameter of microemulsion is about 10
          -2To 10
          -1In the micrometer range.Microemulsion is translucent, and great majority have low viscosity.The viscosity of many O/W type microemulsions is suitable with the viscosity of water.Microemulsion is often described in the literature, but their preparation is difficult, because microemulsion exists scope in most of the cases very little in the three-phase phasor of being made up of oil ingredient, water and emulsifying agent, and the position of these scopes is subjected to the influence of the architectural feature of all other components in all components and the system to a great extent.Consider they compare with macroscopical emulsion have higher stability, an inner phase more segment cloth, higher effectiveness and the active component better percutaneous penetrance therein of great majority, microemulsion is significant for the preparation of cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparation.Another advantage is to consider low viscosity, and microemulsion is sprayable.If microemulsion is as cosmetics, then corresponding product is a feature with high-grade cosmetics.
        
In the cosmetic emulsion field that is used for skin protection and hair care, there are many requirements in consumer.Except cleaning and nursing efficacy (they determines application purpose), important also have different parameters, the outward appearance of for example high as far as possible skin-friendliness, excellence, the organoleptic impression and the storage stability of the best.Some these features (for example skin-friendliness) can most ofly be determined by those skilled in the art.But, irrelevant with these factors, known that the finely divided character of emulsion is both relevant with its outward appearance also relevant with storage stability.So, provide with thin especially disperse properties and gathering tendency or even those emulsions of the tendency that is separated of drop under thermal stress, also can not occur even very pay close attention to.In this respect, can be referring to A.Ansmann[Seifen-Ole-Fette-Wachse, 117,518 (1991)], C.Cabeta[
          Journal, 120,162 (1994)], P.Hameyer[
          Journal, 121,216 (1995)], A.Wadle[Parf.Kosm.77 particularly, 250 (1996)].
        
The verified finely divided emulsion of preparation that is particularly conducive to of so-called PIT (phase transition temperature) method.In the single phase method, emulsion components adds and is heated to about 80 â together in room temperature earlier usually, has passed through layered liquid crystal phase scope during this period.After cool to room temperature, obtained finely divided emulsifying oil phase.In two stage heat/full-boiled process (preferably industrial circle implement), the no water of oil substances and emulsifying agent under uniform temp by some water and milkization.Here, in emulsion concentrates, emulsion is by transparency emulsion, to wherein adding remaining water at about 85 â.Therefore, emulsion transforms and obtains very finely divided O/W emulsion.
The shortcoming of prior art
As the O/W emulsion or contain the O/W emulsion and cosmetic formulations that contain high-load pigment is gone up except making up usually and also shown for example so-called albefaction the disadvantageous behavior, promptly form white point on skin, active component is distributed on the surface of being used insufficient and unsatisfactoryly.
Another shortcoming of the O/W emulsion of prior art is usually a deficient in stability when low or high pH (hydrolysis) and higher electrolyte concentration.For example, Wen Dingxing shortage causes being separated.Although this often can obtain remedying to a certain degree by suitable selection emulsifier system, often cause other defective.Often can not omit electrolyte, because will use their performance.
Usually, the temperature of preparation PIT emulsion is higher, and the PIT that reduces these emulsions is favourable.


Therefore, the purpose of this invention is to provide in cosmetic field polyelectrolyte concentration and/or the stable O/W emulsion of high ionic strength.
Though those skilled in the art have known the measure that can obtain finely divided emulsion in principle, the emulsion of prior art still can not be entirely satisfactory, and considers the selection of used emulsifying agent.Particularly, outward appearance, organoleptic impression and steady heat storage sexual needs improve.
Therefore, another object of the present invention provides compared with prior art, has the O/W emulsion of improved finely divided character and storage stability simultaneously, particularly under higher temperature.
Another object of the present invention provides at the nursing cosmetics, decorates viscosity with minimizing and/or butyrous preparation in cosmetics and the drug world.
In addition, the objective of the invention is to develop the base material that is used for cosmetic formulations, it is characterized in that having the advantages of good skin compatibility.
A further object of the present invention provides has multiduty as far as possible product.Should provide the base material that can be used for following dosage form: for example clean emulsion, facial and body care preparation, and the form that is provided for medical medicine and/or dermatological applications.The example of mentioning is the preparation of anti-acne and other skin symptom.
Light protective agent
Ultraviolet in the illumination is known to the illeffects of skin.Though wavelength is absorbed by the ozone in the earth atmosphere less than the ray in 290nm (UVC zone), the light of 290-320nm (UVB zone) scope cause erythema, simply the sunburn or even more serious or slight burn.
The active maximum of the erythema of sunlight be commonly considered as about 308nm than close limit.
Many radiating chemical compounds of UVB that are used to resist have been known; These great majority are derivants of following material: 3-benzylidene camphor, para-amino benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, salicylic acid, benzophenone, and 2-Phenylbenzimidazole.The also lightscreening agent material in about 320-400nm (UVA zone) scope importantly is because the ray in this scope also can cause infringement.Therefore, proved that the UVA radiation causes damaging the elasticity and the collagen fiber of conjunctive tissue, this makes the skin premature aging, and thinks that they also can cause many phototoxicities and photosensitivity reaction.The radiating illeffects of UVB can be strengthened by the UVA radiation.
The UV radiation also causes photochemical reaction, and the photochemical reaction product disturbs the metabolism of skin.
In order to prevent these reactions, cosmetics or skin pharmaceutical formulations can contain antioxidant and/or free radical scavenger in addition.
Known protection skin is resisted the UV absorbent of UV ray or the most important inorganic pigment of UV reflective agent is the oxide of titanium, zinc, ferrum, zirconium, silicon, manganese, aluminum, cerium with acting in cosmetic field, and their mixture.
The chemical compound that can improve the light protection effect of light protective agent is called LPF (the light protection factor) or SPF (sun protection factor) improver.Another object of the present invention provides photoprotection effect that can improve light protective agent and the chemical compound that therefore is used as LPF or SPF improver.
Eliminating smell agent
Also be suitable as the base material of eliminating smell agent based on the preparation of O/W emulsion.The cosmetics eliminating smell agent is used for removing the body odour that is produced during by microbial decomposition when fresh perspiration (own tasteless).Conventional cosmetics eliminating smell agent is based on different active principles.In so-called anti-perspirant, astringent (mainly be aluminum salt, for example polymeric aluminum chloride (aluminum chlorhydrate)) has reduced the formation of perspiration.By in the cosmetics eliminating smell agent, using antimicrobial material, can reduce the bacterium colony on skin.In this respect, it is desirable to, only should reduce the microorganism that causes taste effectively.Flowing of perspiration itself do not influenced by this, and only temporarily stops the microbial decomposition of perspiration under perfect condition.The combination of astringent and antimicrobial active substance also is common in same compositions.
Eliminating smell agent should meet the following conditions:
1) taste removal reliably;
2) can not damage the natural biological process of skin;
3) be not harmless in incorrect storage or other by instructing under the situation about using;
4) can on skin, not assemble after the repeated use;
5) can introduce well in the conventional cosmetic formulations.
Known and liquid eliminating smell agent commonly, for example aerosol spray, roller agent etc., and solid preparation, for example taste removal bar, powder, powder spray, deep layer cleaning compositions etc.
Therefore, another object of the present invention provides the preparation that is suitable as the base material that is used for cosmetics eliminating smell agent or anti-perspirant, and it does not have the shortcoming of prior art, for example crosses the emulsifying agent of a large amount.
In addition, the objective of the invention is to develop the base material of cosmetics that is used for the cosmetics eliminating smell agent, it is characterized in that having the advantages of good skin compatibility.
In addition, should be provided for the emulsion of humidification skin, or be used for stablizing the emulsion of sensitive active ingredients (for example vitamin C or enzyme).
In addition, the purpose of this invention is to provide the cosmetic hair preparation, especially for the cosmetic formulations of hair conditioning and scalp, it is used in particular for strengthening hair and/or gives hair style generally with stationarity and fullness.
People's hair, particularly as the outer field epidermis of hair, and the keratin zone between epidermis and cortex, be exposed to the specific stress that causes by following effect: because environmental effect, combing and scrub, and because hair treatment, particularly hair-dyeing and hair fixing, the process of for example perming.
If stress is strong especially, for example, wherein be distributed in the oxidized property of the pigment destruction in the cortex with oxidant hydrogen peroxide bleaching for example, then hair inside also is affected.If people's hair is wanted permanent stain, then only actually oxidative coloration of hair process is suitable.In the painted hair of oxidisability, similar to the hair of bleaching, detect the microcosmic hole on the position of melanin granule existing.Oxidant not only with the dyestuff former method should, and with the hair substance reaction, so cause under specific environment, damaging hair.Promptly use aggressiveness surfactant washing hair also can give the hair stress application, make the overall appearance variation of outward appearance or hair style at least.For example, specific water solublity hair composition (for example urea, uric acid, xanthine, keratin, glycogen, citric acid, lactic acid) can be washed out owing to have one's hair wash.
For above-mentioned reasons, cosmetic hair care has been used some times, and some of them are washed off (" washing out ") from hair after tending in action once more, and some of them are tended to be retained on the hair.The latter can prepare in the mode that only is used to nurse independent hair, and has improved the outward appearance of overall hair style, for example by giving bigger fullness, extended immobilization hair style to hair or improving its mouldable.
For example, by quaternary ammonium compound, can improve the compatibility of hair fatefully.These chemical compounds still can detect after the hair of being everlasting has washed for several times attached on the hair.
Always need to nurse in a satisfactory manner the active component and the preparation of damaged hair.The preparation of giving the hair style fullness also often proves insufficient; They are not suitable for use in hair care formulations at least.The hair style of prior art fixedly preparation contains for example sticky ingredient usually, and the risk that this has the sensation that causes being clamminess often must compensate by skilled preparation.
Many cosmetic formulations are forms of Emulsion, gel, cream, and usually as the application form use higher with the water specific viscosity.Form required rheological behaviour, particularly required viscosity, realize by using rheology modifier, for example thickening agent.If the electrolyte concentration in the preparation meets or exceeds particular value, then the acceptable thickening agent of Chang Gui cosmetics no longer can be guaranteed enough effects.
Therefore, another object of the present invention provides the acceptable material of cosmetics, when having polyelectrolyte concentration, this material also can be used as thickening agent in cosmetic formulations, and thickening agent (for example polyacrylic acid) conventional under described polyelectrolyte concentration no longer shows required effect.
The scheme of dealing with problems
The problems referred to above realize that by the cosmetic formulations that contains emulsion oil-in-water is provided wherein emulsion oil-in-water contains:
A) at least a amphipathic nature polyalcohol, it comprises one or more hydrophobic unit A and one or more hydrophilic units B, and wherein hydrophobic unit A is from being formed by the polyisobutylene of terminal polar group modification,
B) at least a component that is suitable as the HLB value of emulsifying agent for 8-20,
C) at least a oil and/or fatty phase and
D) water.
Term " amphipathic " is well known to a person skilled in the art, represents that this material had both had also possess hydrophilic property of lipophile.
Hydrophobic unit A
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, hydrophobic unit (A) can be that the reactive polyisobutylene of 150-50000 carries out functionalization and obtains by number-average molecular weight Mn.
Preferred such amphipathic nature polyalcohol a), its hydrophobic unit A forms from the polyisobutylene block, the polyisobutylene macromole of described polyisobutylene block has two keys that the end of 50mol% is at least arranged.Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, 50mol%, the preferred functionalized reactive polyisobutylene molecule for the treatment of of 60mol% at least have terminal double bond at least, based on the total number meter of polyisobutylene molecule.
Amphipathic nature polyalcohol generally is the cuts with material of wide or narrow molecular weight distribution.
Preferably, each hydrophobic unit (A) is formed by the polyisobutylene block.For the object of the invention, polyisobutylene abbreviates PIB sometimes as.
With the corresponding polyisobutylene of above definition, promptly its macromole of 50mol% at least has terminal two keys of arranging, is called as reactive polyisobutylene.Term " terminal two keys of arranging " is understood that to refer to simultaneously the two keys of Î²-olefinic (vinyl)-[CH=C (CH
          3)
          2] and the two keys of alpha-alefinically (vinylidene base)-[C (CH
          3)=CH
