                        Description
                    








INCI: Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate
Lamecreme is a PEG-free O/W emulsifier based on natural raw materials. It is a combination of glycerol mono/distearates and citric acid esters of mono and diglycerides. Lamecreme is free from synthetic and petrochemical raw materials. Emulsions made with Lamecreme give a pleasantly soft feeling to the skin. Due to its pronounced film formation, it is more suitable for dry skin . It can be used to make light as well as rich emulsions. Even at low dosages, Lamecreme convinces with its high emulsifying capacity. As a co-emulsifier, it stabilises creams with e.g. temulsifier.
