                            General information
                        Xanthan gum exhibits extraordinary and useful properties, for example high viscosity at low concentrations, little change in viscosity at varying temperatures, and excellent stability over a wide pH range. It also provides good freeze-thaw stability and shows remarkable suspension characteristics. It is used as a stabiliser, thickener, suspending agent and bodying agent in food applications such as salad dressings, sauces, instant products, desserts, bakery dairy products, and fruit juices as well as in the formation of various low-calorie foods. Cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications of xanthan gum include the use in tooth pastes, lotions, shampoos and formulations such as tablets. Typical industrial applications of xanthan gum is the use in cleaners, paints, ceramic glazes, inks and oil drilling fluids.

                                In Europe, xanthan gum is listed as generally permitted food additive (E 415) and may be added to all foodstuffs, following the “quantum satis“ principle, as long as no special regulation restricts the use (cf. Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008).In the USA the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has affirmed xanthan gum as food additive permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption in accordance with 21 CFR § 172.695.Being a polymer, xanthan gum is exempted from REACH registration. Also, no monomer registration is required for this substance.
