CoA





Natrosol™ 250 HHR CS by Ashland Specialty Chemical acts as a thickening and stabilizing agent. It is a non-ionic, water-soluble polymer made by reacting ethylene oxide with alkali-cellulose under rigidly controlled conditions. It is pseudoplastic or shear-thinning. As a result, personal care products formulated with Natrosol™ 250 HHR CS dispenses rich and thick from the container, but spread easily on hair and skin. It is easily dissolved in cold or hot water to give crystal-clear solutions of varying viscosities and generally insoluble in organic solvents. Natrosol™ 250 HHR CS is used in toothpastes, hair conditioners, liquid soaps and bubble bath, hand creams and lotions.
