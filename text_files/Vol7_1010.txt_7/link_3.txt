Product Overview


INCI HydroxyethylcelluloseCommonly used in a wide variety of applications in personal care, Natrosol™ 250 hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) is a nonionic, water-soluble polymer derived from cellulose. Natrosol™ HEC is easily dissolved in cold or hot water to give crystal clear solutions of varying viscosities. Solutions of Natrosol™ HEC are pseudoplastic or shear-thinning. As a result, personal care products formulated with Natrosol™ HEC dispense rich and thick from the container, but spread easily on hair and skin.
