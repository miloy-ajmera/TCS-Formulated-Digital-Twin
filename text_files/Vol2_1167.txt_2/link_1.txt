MIGLYOL® PPG 810

Technical Datasheet
|

Supplied by IOI Oleo







Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate. MIGLYOL® PPG 810 by IOI Oleo acts as an emollient, solvent and dispersant. It has a high polar oil component with a fast spreading capability. It leaves a light, dry, non-oily, smooth and velvet skin sensation similar to low molecular weight silicone oils. It shows excellent dispersing and dissolving properties for pigments, for organic UV-filters and sun care formulations. The high polarity makes it particularly suitable for the use in color cosmetics and BB-creams. Its applications include sun care, face care, hand cream and lip care products. MIGLYOL® PPG 810 is RSPO MB certified.
