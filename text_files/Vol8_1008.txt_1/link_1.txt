Alter or enhance the characteristics of oil colours
Choosing complementary oils, solvents, mediums, and varnishes for your oil painting is as unique as choosing a colour palette. Depending on your style and technique, there are a wide range of traditional oils, mediums, and solvents to help you control your colour as well as varnishes to protect your work and provide a final finish. Used to modify the rate of drying, increase gloss, improve flow or add texture, mediums should be used in moderation as an additive to the colour.

Choose & combine different types of oil mediums



 
Primers
Primers protect your surfaces and provide a controlled absorption for oil painting. A thorough foundation contributes to a long-lasting artwork.




 
Oils
Oils will modify the colours viscosity, gloss and drying time. Using oils maintains the ﬂexibility of paint ﬁlms, particularly when working fat over lean.




 
Mediums
Used to alter or enhance the characteristics of oil colour, mediums are used to modify the rate of drying, increase gloss, improve flow or add texture.




 
Solvents
Used to clean brushes and palettes after painting. Our solvents are mad speciﬁcally for artists’ use and are fully volatile, meaning they leave no residual matter once evaporated.




 
Varnishes
Sealing with a varnish as ﬁnal step for thoroughly dried artworks, to protect it from the build up of dirt and grease, and the passage of time. Available as sprays or in bottles, and in different ﬁnishes.
