 WHY YOU WILL LOVE IT





 AWAKENS TIRED SKIN​


 DEPUFFS




Stimulates and illuminates skin around the darkened, tired-looking eye area​


 Improves circulation and strengthens delicate skin prone to puffiness​




Probiotics and natural botanicals in our eye cream slow the production of melanin that gives the delicate skin around your eyes a dark, puffy, and weathered look. Caffeine wakes up tired under-eye skin by stimulating blood flow to reduce puffiness and strengthen your skin. Pomegranate extract tightens the skin for a smooth feel with added hydration. Because you don’t need exhausted dark circles under your eyes to show that you put in a hard day’s work.

This eye cream doesn't feel heavy and cheap like other eye creams. Really refreshing way to start my day
