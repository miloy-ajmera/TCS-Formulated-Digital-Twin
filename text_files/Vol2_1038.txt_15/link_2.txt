RECOMMENDED BY DOCTORS, LOVED BY SKIN


























 


































70% of people around the world say that they have some degree of skin sensitivity. We've partnered with dermatologists to identify 5 signs of sensitivity, and our products are clinically tested to defend against these 5 signs and improve the resilience of your skin.






















1


Dryness



















Dryness





Dry skin is a common indicator of skin sensitivity. A weakened skin barrier creates an ineffective seal on the skin's surface, making it harder to retain moisture and keep the skin hydrated.

















The solution





Nourishing, hydrating ingredients like glycerin and shea butter strengthen the skin barrier to better retain moisture. Our products effectively hydrate your skin without causing irritation.













2


Irritation



















Irritation





If you have sensitive skin, you're more likely to react to things like cold weather and skincare products containing harsh ingredients, resulting in redness, itching, burning or stinging.

















The solution





Our products are formulated with gentle, soothing ingredients, dermatologist recommendedto care for sensitive skin.













3


Roughness



















ROUGHNESS





Our skin regularly sheds its surface layers to keep it smooth and healthy looking. But this process can become disrupted, resulting in patches of rough, dry, uneven and flaky skin.

















The solution





Gentle exfoliation using a gentle cleanser or a moisturizer can smooth rough skin without causing irritation or drying out your skin, strengthening the natural skin barrier and allowing the outer layer to be renewed.













4


Tightness



















Tightness





Dehydrated skin loses elasticity, causing it to feel tight. This uncomfortable feeling is common for those with sensitive skin – nearly 98% of people with sensitive skin report this sensation.

















The solution





Use a hydrating cleanser or moisturizer on tight skin to tackle dryness and improve skin elasticity.Look for skincare products designed for your sensitive skin to gently hydrate and restore the skin's moisture barrier.













5


Weakened skin barrier



















Weakened skin barrier





The role of our skin barrier is to keep moisture in and irritants out. A weakened or damaged skin barrier becomes less effective, leaving you prone to a range of sensitive skin issues.

















The solution





All of Cetaphil's skincare products help to maintain, strengthen and restore the skin barrier, formulated with skin-essential vitamins and other nourishing ingredients.

























 












Healing Ointment for dry, cracked skin














Cetaphil Healing Ointment is specially formulated with a high concentration of the active ingredient, petrolatum, to quickly protect and heal dry, irritated, sensitive skin.
