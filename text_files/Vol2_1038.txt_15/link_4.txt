										Blue Rx CompleteSM
Welcome

													We cover both brand name drugs and generic drugs. Generic drugs have the same active-ingredient formula as a brand name drug. Generic drugs usually cost less than brand name drugs and are rated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be as safe and effective as brand name drugs.

													
													
														Members may be required to pay more for a prescription when a brand-name product is dispensed.
													

													
													
												
What is a Drug List?
A formulary drug list is a list of drugs covered under your pharmacy benefit and developed to serve as a guide for physicians, pharmacists, healthcare professionals
                                                    and members in the selection of cost-effective drug therapy. The formulary does not define benefit coverage and limitations. Many members have specific
                                                    benefit inclusions, exclusions, copayments or a lack of coverage, which are not reflected in the formulary. Members should contact their Plan Sponsor or
                                                    Wellmark Customer Service at the number on the back of their ID card if they have questions regarding their coverage.
