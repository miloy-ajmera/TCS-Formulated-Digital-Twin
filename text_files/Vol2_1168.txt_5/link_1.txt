Components 1-7 are mixed and homogenized (e.g. with an Ultra  Turrax). After items 8-11 are added and the mass is heated to  about 8OC until melting.         Finally 10-15% pearl pigments (item 12) are added to the  melted mixture and stirred until the mass is homogeneous.         When pouring the sticks, the casting machine and the mixture  should have a temperature of about 70C and the mold should be  preheated to 60C.    SOURCE: EM Pigments Division: Formulas

Comments :       Emulgade F Special is a self-emulsifying base used for the    preparation of oil-in-water emulsions. Because it is nonionic,  cationic substances can be easily formulated into creams and    lotions.       This formulation is a light cream and is characterized by a    non greasy rubout, quick penetration and a soft, non-drying    after-feel.
