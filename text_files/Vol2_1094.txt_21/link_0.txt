BOOST LAMINATION SYSTEM - these are 3 booster products for enhanced lamination of eyebrows and eyelashes. This means that these products can be used on very coarse hairs (Asian type) that are difficult to style and curl.And they are also suitable for working with hairs of different ethnic types due to the adjustable selection of the exposure time of the products to obtain the perfect result.Collagen, which is part of all products, deeply moisturizes the hairs, protects them from dryness and damage, preserves the hair structure during each stage of the long-term styling procedure.At the first stage of Step #1 ON, due to the enhanced formula of the products, the scales open very quickly and the active ingredients of the products penetrate into the hair, restructuring existing disulfide bonds.At the second stage Step #2 OFF – neutralization and formation of new connections, consolidation of a new form.At the third stage Step #3 LIKE, thanks to the active patented Hygroplex HHG complex, the composition cares, conditions and fills the hairs, perfectly completing the lamination process. Important: the maximum effect at the time of lamination can be guaranteed by the use of only 1, 2, 3 compositions exclusively by TM EkkoBeauty.* for the correct selection of the exposure time of products on different types of hairs, carefully read the instructions.Hygroplex HHG is a patented hair moisturizing ingredient from the German company CLR.Precautions: STEP #1 contains thioglycolate and ammonia, STEP #2 contains hydrogen peroxide!Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical advice. Use protective gloves. An allergy test should be performed before use. Do not use for skin inflammations and allergic reactions. In cases of an allergic reaction, you should consult your doctor. For compositions 1 and 2, do not use metal objects. For professional use only.Before carrying out the lamination procedure, carefully read the instructions for use. COMPOSITION/INGREDIENTS STEP #1 ON: Aqua, Thioglycolide Oxide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ammonium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Ethanolamine, Paraffinum Liquidum, Ethylexyl Stearate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydroxypropyl Gluconamide (and) Hydroxypropyl Gluconamide (and) and) Methylparaben (and) Propylparaben , Disodium EDTA, Polyquaternium-22, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Citronellol, Geraniol INGREDIENTS STEP #2 OFF: Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrogen Peroxide, Cetrimonium Chloride, Ceteareth-20, Ethylexyl Stearate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Stannate, Phospho INGREDIENTS STEP #3 LIKE: Aqua, Polysorbate 20, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate , phenoxyethanol (and) ethylexylglycerin, hydroxypropyl gluconamide (and) hidoxycopylammonium gluconate, panthenol, hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed keratin, parfum, lactic acid, benzyl benzo
