PRODUCT INFORMATION 26.13.084e/04.00 IMWITOR ® <strong>375</strong> Food Grade O/W Emulsifier for Polar Oils Description IMWITOR ® <strong>375</strong> is a partially neutralized ester of mono- and diglycerides of unsaturated edible fatty acids with citric acid and lactic acid, having a characteristic odor. INCI Name: Glyceryl Citrate/Lactate/Linoleate/Oleate Characteristic Values Tests Value Unit Method Acid value* max. 15 mg KOH/g EP** 2.5.1 Saponification value* 230 - 250 mg KOH/g DGF** C-V 3 pH-value, 10 % in water 6 - 7 EP 2.2.3 Free glycerol* max. 3 % EP 1-monoglyceride* 10 - 30 % EP * Included in Certificate of Analysis Properties • IMWITOR ® <strong>375</strong> is a yellowish liquid of viscous consistency, similar to honey, having a soybean oil-type odor and a neutral taste. • IMWITOR ® <strong>375</strong> is readily soluble in acetone, medium chain triglycerides and fatty oils, and is slightly soluble in ethanol. IMWITOR ® <strong>375</strong> is easily dispersible in water. • In addition to its emulsifying properties, IMWITOR ® <strong>375</strong> improves skin feel significantly. • IMWITOR ® <strong>375</strong> is compatible with skin and mucosa, is non-toxic, and is approved as a food grade emulsifier in Europe (E 472 b/c). Applications • Because of its dispersing properties, formulations with IMWITOR ® <strong>375</strong> can be manufactured in cold water. • If the emulsifier and consistency regulator IMWITOR ® 370 is used simultaneously, the use of a highspeed agitator is recommended. • Depending upon the application, the use of antioxidants may be advisable, because of the presence of unsaturated ingredients.
