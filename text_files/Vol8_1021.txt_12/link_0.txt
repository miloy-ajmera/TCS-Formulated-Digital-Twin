INCI (CTFA) and JCIC** names: MIGLYOL <strong>810</strong>, <strong>812</strong> Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (JCIC: Caprylic/Capric Acid Triglyceride) MIGLYOL <strong>818</strong> Caprylic/Capric/Linoleic Triglyceride MIGLYOL <strong>829</strong> Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride MIGLYOL <strong>840</strong> Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate 3. Properties MIGLYOL neutral oils are clear, virtually colorless liquids of neutral odor and taste. MIGLYOL neutral oils are very pure because of their carefully selected raw materials. As a result of tightly controlled manufacturing process, they contain very few microorganisms and are free of additives such as antioxidants, solvents and catalyst residues (Exception: MIGLYOL <strong>818</strong>, which contains an antioxidant). MIGLYOL neutral oils have the following advantages in comparison to natural oils: High stability against oxidation (Exception: MIGLYOL <strong>818</strong> contains about 4 % linoleic acid). Liquid at 0 °C. Excellent spreadability on the skin and good skin absorption. Do not inhibit skin-respiration. Excellent penetration-promoting, emollient and skin-smoothing properties. Very good solubility characteristics. 4. Solubilities MIGLYOL neutral oils are soluble at 20 °C in the following solvents: Hexane, toluene, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol 96%. <strong>Neutral</strong> oils are miscible in all ratios with paraffin hydrocarbons and natural oils.
