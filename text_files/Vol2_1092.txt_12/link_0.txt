Let’s be honest: if you are a skincare rookie, maybe glycerin is not on your radar as a skincare must-have. Maybe you have always just thought of it as an ingredient in moisturizers and lip balms, but never really understood what all the fuss was about. 
Well, let us tell you a little about the awesomeness that is glycerin and why every skincare aficionado should be using it in their skincare routine. From helping with skin hydration and aiding in the wound healing process, boosting collagen production, skin whitening, and minimizing pores, there are many benefits of glycerin that make it one of the skincare’s world faves.  
Don’t believe us yet? Does the idea of slathering glycerin all over your skin make you break out in a cold sweat? Are you convinced that it can’t be used by people with perfect, porcelain skin because it can clog pores? If so, you're in for a treat! 
In this post, we'll break down the science behind glycerin and show you how to use it to get the best results for your unique skin type. Plus, we've got eleven reasons why you should start using glycerin today! Keep reading to learn more.
Glycerin in a nutshell: Fast facts
Before we jump into all the amazing benefits and how to use it, let’s give you some quick facts about this ingredient:

Glycerin is a deliciously soft humectant. 
It is a clear, odorless, and viscous liquid that has a sweet taste. 
It can be derived from animal fats or vegetable oils, so it can sometimes vegan-friendly.
Glycerin is often used in many cosmetics and skin care products because of its ability to attract and retain moisture, including lotions, creams, shampoos, conditioners, soap, and other products. So the chances are that, if you have ever used any kind of cosmetics, you have already used glycerin.
Using glycerin is generally considered to be safe and clean, however, some people with sensitive skin may present allergic reactions, that’s why you should always do a patch test before using it. 
Most of the time, glycerin is extracted from plants, however, it can also be made synthetically in a lab. Both natural and synthetic glycerin have the same benefits!

Wanna learn more about glycerin for the skin? Visit our glycerin ingredients page to keep deciphering this awesome ingredient!
Glycerin in action: How does it work?
Simply put, glycerin attracts water to the skin. It does this by drawing water from the dermis, or innermost layer of skin to the most external layers. 
In addition to its hydrating properties, glycerin also has occlusive effects. This means that it helps to create a barrier on the surface of the skin that prevents moisture loss. This can help to protect the skin from environmental aggressors, such as wind and pollution.
 11 Fabulous Benefits of Glycerin You Need To Know ASAP! 
Glycerin is jam-packed with many amazing benefits that will work wonders for your skin. It is one of those one-in-all ingredients that not only has hydrating properties but can also decrease sun sensitivity and help with conditions like acne-prone skin or sensitive skin. 
So, what are these fabulous benefits we are so obsessed with? Keep reading to find out: 
1. A moisturization magnet 
Glycerin is a humectant, meaning that it helps to lock moisture in the skin. When used in products like lotions or a facial moisturizer, glycerin can help to prevent the evaporation of water from the skin’s surface, keeping it hydrated for longer. 
Additionally, because glycerin attracts water molecules, it can also help to draw moisture from deeper layers of the skin up to the outer layer This makes glycerin an excellent ingredient for both dry and oily skin types, or for those who have cracked or parched skin.

2. Cools down skin irritation 
One of the main reasons vegetable glycerin *aka v-glycerin* is added to skin care products because it has the ability to calm and soothe dry skin when applied topically. Why? Because it creates an extra skin barrier between your skin and the environment. This barrier helps to protect your skin from irritants while also helping to lock in moisture.
Glycerin is often used as a treatment for eczema, psoriasis, and temporary skin discomfort. It can help to decrease rashes, itching, and inflammation.
3. It’s an environmental shield 
As we said before, glycerin works as a shield for the skin’s protective barrier. This means that it protects skin from environmental damage, including things like pollution, UV rays, and other harmful elements that can cause premature aging and damage to your skin cells.
Glycerin works by creating a barrier on the surface of your skin that attracts moisture and keeps out toxins. This not only helps to increase skin hydration but also prevents dirt from getting you clogged pores.
4. Smooths wrinkles and fine lines
Wrinkles and fine lines often happen because the skin is not hydrated. Taking that into account, the moisturizing properties of glycerin translate into keeping your skin hydrated and plump, which will lead to fewer aging signs.

5. Is non-comedogenic
Glycerin is a natural by-product of soap making. It's what gives the soap its moisturizing properties, and it can do the same for your skin. Both animal and vegetable glycerine are non-comedogenic, meaning it won't clog your pores or cause breakouts. In fact, glycerin can help to treat acne by drawing water into the skin and keeping it with a healthy glow, while giving it an oil-free sensation. 
6. Helps with wound healing
One of the most common uses for glycerin is to help heal wounds. When applied to a wound, it forms a barrier that helps keep moisture in and keeps bacteria out. This can speed up the healing process and help prevent infection.
To use glycerin for wound healing, simply wash your hands, and apply it to the affected area with a clean cotton ball or gauze pad. 
7. Treats chapped lips
Because not only should the skin be moisturized, the lips have to be taken care of too! 
Sometimes we have cracked skin on our lips, which can make them look old and pale. In these cases, glycerin can be a powerful hydrator that will help your lips come back to life.
8. Helps with acne 
Since it draws water from the environment, glycerin can help keep acne-prone and oily skin from drying out. Moreover, it has antimicrobial properties which aid to kill bacteria that can cause breakouts. 
On the other hand, glycerin is ideal to heal acne scars and fade their appearance. It does this by increasing the water content in the scar tissue, which helps to plump up the skin and smooth out skin tone. Read related article: How To Get Rid Of Acne
9. It is a gentle exfoliator too! 
When used as an exfoliator, glycerin can help to improve the appearance of your skin by making it look softer and smoother. This happens because glycerin can remove dead skin cells without stripping your face from its natural oils. Read more on what is exfoliation here. 
10. Firms the skin 
One of the main reasons why glycerin is so popular in skin care products is because it has been shown to improve overall skin health. As an active ingredient, glycerin can help to tighten and firm the skin, giving it a more youthful, yummy-looking, dumpling-like  appearance
11. Responsible for making your skin bright 
Glycerin is used as a skin brightening agent for oily to dry skin. It can help to even out skin tone, making you have healthy skin in no time.
 Glycerin in skin care: Who can use it? 
As a powerful moisture magnet, glycerin is an ideal ingredient for people with dry skin, as it can help to increase moisture levels. It can also be helpful for people with sensitive skin, as it can help to soothe and protect against irritation.
All in all, this amazing ingredient can be used by all skin types. In fact, even people with oily or acne-prone skin can benefit from using glycerin on their skin. This is because glycerin helps to regulate sebum production, which can help to control breakouts and reduce shine. Awesome right?
Now let’s talk about more how glycerin benefits each skin type: 
 Glycerin uses for dry skin 
If you have dry skin and chapped lips, glycerin can be a real godsend. It's a natural humectant, meaning it helps to keep your skin hydrated by attracting moisture from the air and trapping it in your skin cells. This can help to prevent flakiness and restore your skin's natural barrier function. 
 Glycerin uses for acne-prone 
Use glycerin if you have acne-prone skin, yeeees! 
If you are acne-prone, glycerin can help to keep your skin hydrated and reduce the appearance of blemishes. When used as part of a skincare routine, this ingredient can help to remove dead skin cells, which often cause breakouts.
To use glycerin for acne-prone skin, add a few drops to a clean cotton ball and apply it to the affected area. You can also add a few drops of glycerin to your moisturizer or foundation before applying it to your face.
However, bear in mind that it is always better to use formulated glycerin in skincare products than to apply it all by yourself!
 Glycerin uses for oily skin 
Glycerin is often used as a natural remedy for oily skin since it can keep skin soft. This amazing ingredient can also help to regulate the production of sebum, retaining the skin from becoming too greasy.
You can apply glycerin soaps to help to control oil production and are specially formulated for your skin type. Look for soaps that contain at least 50% glycerin.
 Glycerin uses for sensitive skin 
Since it is non-irritating and non-comedogenic, glycerin won't clog your pores or aggravate existing sensitivities. 
However, you should keep in mind that the use of glycerin can lead to an allergic reaction in some people with oversensitivity, so you should always do a patch test before including it and dilute glycerin with an essential oil when using it. 
How to include glycerin in your skincare routine
Glycerin is a hydration booster for all skin types, which makes it a great addition to most skincare products. You can find glycerin alone or mixed with other ingredients like rose water or hyaluronic acid. 
Here is how you can use glycerin in your regime: 


In a cleanser


The cleansing process can often dry out your skin *especially when you use harsh cleansers* That's why glycerin is such a good ally! 
People use glycerin as an ingredient in cleansers because it helps to keep the skin hydrated and prevents the stripping of natural oils. 


In a hydrating toner


Many skin care brands have been mixing glycerin with hyaluronic acid to create a toner, and for a good reason! 
Glycerin can be used as a toner, but how effective it is will depend on your skin. If your skin is oily, a glycerin toner can help to control shine and remove excess oil. If you have dry skin, glycerin can help to hydrate and protect the skin from further moisture loss. Glycerin can also be helpful for people with sensitive skin, as it can help to soothe and calm the skin.
For this, you can add glycerin to a spray bottle containing toner, or buy already-formulated toners depending on your skin condition and type. 


In a moisturizer *obviously*


Mix glycerin with other hydrating ingredients and you’ll get an awesome moisturizer! 
We have said this a lot today, but glycerin is a moisture magnet that can hydrate your skin from the outer to the deeper layers without risking free radical damage. 
That’s why you can find glycerin in body lotions and facial creams! Moreover, you can add an essential oil to glycerin and create a homemade moisturizer


In a lip balm


This syrupy liquid is one of the most common ingredients in lip balms thanks to its hydrating properties. It is often used to deeply hydrate cracked, old-looking lips. 
For this, you can use glycerin directly on your lips or get a lip balm with SPF! 


In a makeup remover


Glycerin can be mixed with rose water to create a mild makeup remover for all types of skin. Even though it is not common, some skin care companies choose to add this ingredient to counter the effects of other drying active ingredients. 


In a mild sunscreen


Since it can protect the skin from environmental damage, the skin care companies use glycerin as one of the sunscreen’s main ingredients. This can help to shield the skin from the sun's rays and prevent sunburn.


In a face mask


Glycerin and hyaluronic acid are often used in face masks, especially clay masks, to keep the skin hydrated. 
There are some types of clays, like white kaolin clay and bentonite clay, that can be super-drying, that’s why many clay masks include a form of glycerin in their listed ingredients. 
It can also be used in masks containing lemon juice to avoid irritation. 
 Glycerin in skin care: Is it vegan or not? 
There’s no definitive answer to this question!
There are two main types of glycerin: vegetable glycerin and animal glycerin. Vegetable glycerine is made from plants and oils, while animal glycerin comes from animal fats. Both types of glycerin are safe for most people to use on their skin.
Medically reviewed vegetable glycerin is the type most often used in skin care products. It's a clear, odorless liquid that's derived from coconut oil, palm oil, or soybean oil. However, the fact that it is derived from commonly-known comedogenic ingredients, doesn’t mean that glycerin is comedogenic. 
Animal glycerin is made from animal oils. It's a thick, sticky liquid that has a sweet taste. Animal glycerin is less commonly used in skin care products because it can be comedogenic, meaning it can clog pores. However, some people find that animal glycerin helps to soothe and heal dry, cracked skin.
So, in conclusion, glycerin can be vegan or not. You just need to check the products’ label to see if it is vegan-friendly or if they are using animal glycerin!
Can glycerin generate any side effects on the skin?
Glycerin is amazing for the skin, however, there are a few downsides you should prepare yourself for when using this ingredient on your skin: 

It can dry out your skin when used in dry weather

Yes, if you have dry skin and live in a dry climate, glycerin may actually worsen your condition, since the moisture that glycerin attracts to the skin can evaporate quickly, leaving skin feeling even drier than before. 
If you want to use glycerin on dry skin, it's best to do so during humid weather or after bathing when skin is still damp. This will help lock in moisture. You can also try using a glycerin-based product alongside cream or ointment to create a barrier against evaporation.

You can be allergic to it

It's possible to be allergic to glycerin, but it's rare. Symptoms of a glycerin allergy may include redness, itching, and swelling. If you think you may be allergic to glycerin, stop using it and see your dermatologist
