DL Linefade™ 











DL Linefade™ is a breakthrough cosmetic ingredient that activates collagen IV, the pliable consistency anchor between skin layers that deteriorates with age, causing wrinkles, sagging, and other signs of aging. Derived from olive leaf, DL Linefade™ has been shown to increase collagen IV output by +219%, with a significant reduction in wrinkles and facial sagging. This lipid-soluble ingredient is easy to formulate and amplifies the performance of retinol and niacinamide, making it an ideal choice for result-driven skin care products targeting age-related changes in the skin. DL Linefade™ can be incorporated into skin care and makeup products, supporting claims of firming, lifting, and smoothing the skin.
