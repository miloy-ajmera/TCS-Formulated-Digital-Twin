MPC™-Milk Peptide Complex


MPC™ reduces the visible signs of aging by reactivating skin cells and inducing the production of extracellular matrix molecules in the dermis, such as collagen Type I, hyaluronic acid and fibronectin. In vivo studies have shown that formulations with MPC™ make the skin firmer and improve its elasticity. MPC™ quickly and effectively reduces wrinkle depth and improves the structure of the skin.
MPC™– Milk Peptide Complex contains a complex of activated natural signaling molecules derived from milk, such as TGF-β.
