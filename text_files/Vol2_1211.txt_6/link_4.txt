A go-to for beauty devotees born before the 1980s, cold cream is an OG in the world of skincare. Traditionally, it was a mixture of mineral oil, petrolatum (aka petroleum jelly), and beeswax. However, today's iterations can be made with a range of other skin-friendly ingredients, like plant oils and antioxidants.


"Cold cream formulations vary, but they usually contain larger oil-to-water ratios, which gives it the smooth and creamy texture," says dermatologist Hysem Eldik, MD. 


The purpose of cold cream depends on who you talk to, but according to Eldik, most people use it "as a moisturizing makeup remover that doesn't harshly strip the skin."


Ahead, find the best cold creams for when you need ultra-moisture.

An Honest Review of the Iconic Pond's Cold Cream



What We Like

Affordable
Effective makeup remover
Dermatologist-recommended



What We Don't Like

Contains synthetic fragrance




Often imitated, never duplicated, Pond's Cold Cream is a true classic. "This is my absolute favorite," says dermatologist Rachel Nazarian, MD, noting that the gentle yet effective formula is a great option for sensitive complexions. "It leaves the skin soft, doesn't strip its natural hydrators, and does a phenomenal job removing makeup."


This iconic product earned a 4.8 out of 5 overall score from our home tester, who liked the affordable price point and how effortlessly it removed every last smidgen of makeup. "The primary makeup-grabbing ingredient is mineral oil," Nazarian explains, "and it wipes away easily with a damp cloth."


Price at time of publish: $6 for 6.1 oz


Key Ingredients: Mineral oil, beeswax | Size: 3.5–9.5 ounces | Cruelty-Free: No



What Our Testers Say

“One of the best things about this cream—other than its miraculous youth-enhancing effects—is its smell. The scent is so fresh and so clean.” —Jen Hubley Luckwaldt, Product Tester









Best Budget


Nivea Crème














Amazon

View On Ulta
View On Walmart





What We Like

Affordable
Generous amount
Rich moisturization



What We Don't Like

Contains synthetic fragrance




Nivea Crème is another tried-and-true product with a budget-friendly price tag. Though it's not recommended for makeup removal, the super-rich concoction can be used from head to toe when your skin craves moisture. You didn't hear it from us, but some people say it's a dupe of Crème de la Mer on account of the mineral oil-petrolatum base.


Price at time of publish: $12


Key Ingredients: Mineral oil, petrolatum | Size: 13.5 ounces | Cruelty-Free: No









Best Drugstore


Neutrogena Makeup Remover Melting Balm



4.3








































 















Amazon

What We Like

Affordable
Gentle formula
Leaves skin soft



What We Don’t Like

Contains paraffin
Contains PEGs




Neutrogena makes a great cold cream-esque cleansing balm. Instead of mineral oil and petroleum jelly, it calls on coconut oil and carnauba wax to gently melt away makeup without drying out the skin, while vitamin E soothes and softens.


Price at time of publish: $11


Key Ingredients: Coconut oil, carnauba wax, vitamin E | Size: 2 ounces | Cruelty-Free: No









Best Splurge


Perricone MD Cold Plasma Plus+ Neck Chest SPF 25














Amazon





View On Amazon
View On Ulta
View On Dermstore





What We Like

Treats and prevents
Noticeable results
Contains SPF



What We Don’t Like

Expensive




This splurge-worthy cream is an anti-aging workhorse. The kicker is plasma in the form of DMAE (dimethylaminoethanol), which targets everything from fine lines and wrinkles to dark spots and loss of elasticity. It also offers SPF 25 protection from the sun's rays, plus an antioxidant shield from free radical damage. So, even though this cold cream has a higher price point, we think it’s worth it. 


Price at time of publish: $65


Key Ingredients: Dimethylaminoethanol, titanium dioxide, niacinamide, vitamin C | Size: 1 ounce | Cruelty-Free: Yes









Best Makeup Remover


Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser and Makeup Remover














Amazon

What We Like

Affordable
Effective
Minimal ingredients



What We Don’t Like

This no-nonsense cream cleanser is ideal for removing foundation, mascara, and eyeliner. "Consider it a moisturizing makeup remover, rather than an irritating, drying makeup remover that contains alcohol or other inflammatory ingredients," Nazarian says.


Price at time of publish: $13


Key Ingredients: Mineral oil, petrolatum | Size: 12 ounces | Cruelty-Free: Yes

This product looks and feels like a creamy lotion, but it's designed specifically to remove eye makeup.

We appreciate that it's safe for contact lenses and doesn't leave you with an oily feeling.

Award-winning product
Muslin cloth included

What We Don’t Like

Expensive

Many dermatologists love this rich cleansing balm from Eve Lom, and Nazarian is also a fan. "It uses lanolin rather than mineral oil, so make sure to avoid it if you have a lanolin allergy," she says. "It also has essential oils, which give it a great fragrance and a fresh appeal."


Price at time of publish: $17


Key Ingredients: Mineral oil, beeswax | Size: 0.7–6.8 ounces | Cruelty-Free: No

What We Like

Organic
No petroleum byproducts
Eco-conscious company



What We Don’t Like

Pricey




It might look like a jar of puréed-pea baby food, but Date Nut Brûlée is a modern, eco-conscious take on cold cream. Instead of petroleum byproducts and beeswax, the vegan-friendly formula leans on a blend of organic plant oils and sunflower seed wax. You can use it as a cleansing balm, a waterproof eye makeup remover, a head-to-toe moisturizer, a restorative mask, or even a chapped lip remedy.


Price at time of publish: $48


Key Ingredients: Date kernel oil, olive oil, sunflower seed wax | Size: 3.4 ounces | Cruelty-Free: Yes





   Final Verdict  

Our best overall pick is the dermatologist-approved Pond's Cold Cream Makeup Remover, which not only effectively removes makeup, but also hydrates even the most sensitive skin. For a more splurge-worthy pick, consider Perricone MD Cold Plasma Plus+ Neck Chest SPF 25, a youth-boosting cold cream that not only plumps skin but also targets everything from fine lines and wrinkles to dark spots and contains a protective SPF.



Meet the Expert


Hysem Eldik, MD, is a dermatologist at Marmur Medical in New York. Specializing in both general and cosmetic dermatology, he offers everything from eczema and acne treatments to chemical peels and fillers.
Rachel Nazarian, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist practicing at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City.


   What to Look for in a Cold Cream  
  Sensitive Skin-Friendly  

Cold creams are, by nature, pretty gentle in terms of how they cleanse the skin and remove makeup. Still, Nazarian suggests seeking out formulas that work well with sensitive skin, as you wouldn’t want to use anything that could potentially cause irritation or inflammation. It’s also important to consider what works well for your skin—if you’re allergic to lanolin, don’t choose a formula that uses it rather than traditional mineral oil.

  Non-Comedogenic Formulas  

Nazarian also recommends looking for cold creams that specifically state they won’t clog your pores. Since they're typically on the thicker and heavier side, a cold cream that isn’t non-comedogenic can potentially lead to breakouts—even if your skin isn’t oily or acne-prone.

  No Filler Ingredients  

As you would with any skincare product, Nazarian suggests looking for formulas that don’t include sulfates or parabens, as well as synthetic fragrances and other filler ingredients. “Nearly all cold creams are meant to be a combination of oil and water as its main ingredients,” she says, so there’s no need for anything extra other than added moisturizers or ingredients with actual skin benefits.




FAQ



How do you apply cold cream?




Nazarian suggests applying cold cream as follows: “Apply to the entire face evenly with a massaging motion, then use a damp washcloth to remove." She also recommends rinsing with lukewarm water afterward to remove any residue that may have been left behind.






When is the best time to apply cold cream?




In terms of when to apply cold cream, Nazarian says it's best used at night. “It’s so good at removing all the dirt, grime, oil, and makeup from the day, and your skin can benefit from a gentle clean before bed each night,” she says.






How does cold cream remove makeup?




Nazarian explains that cold cream is primarily an oil-in-water product with added moisturizers. “The oil clings to the makeup, dirt, and grime on your skin, and the water and moisturizers allow it to be wiped off easily with a trail of hydration left behind,” she says.







   How We Researched & Tested  

To compile this list, our team of editors and contributors spent hours researching the best products on the market in this category, evaluating their key features—like ingredients, shade range, or design—in addition to reviews from customers and other trusted sources. Our team also incorporated their own personal experiences testing products in their own lives. We then used these insights from our research and testing to assign a star rating from one to five (five being the best; one being the worst) to certain products on the list.

   Why Trust Byrdie  

Theresa Holland is a freelance commerce writer and bonafide skincare nerd. For this story, she compiled the expertise of two dermatologists, who provided product recommendations and insight into formulations and the different uses for cold cream. Before making the final selections, she combed through reviews, pored over ingredient lists, and referenced several peer-reviewed articles. From the above, she has personally used Pond's, Avène, Nivea, Mario Badescu, and Clinique.
