Kolliphor EL is a non-ionic solubilizer and emulsifier made by reacting castor oil with ethylene oxide in a molar ratio of 1:35. It is a pale yellow oily liquid that is clear at temperatures above 26 °C. It has a faint but characteristic odor. It forms clear solutions in water. It is also soluble in many organic solvents, e.g. ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, toluene and xylene.


Benefits
Widely used and fully approved solubilizer
Good compatibility with other ingredients
