Weve utilized this miraculous skincare hero in our gentle cream, packed with antioxidants and combined with a botanical hyaluronic acid complex for everyday radiance. With no oily residue, it wont clog pores or cause blackheads or breakouts, either. It also perfectly follows our Retinol Face Wash and Retinol Serum  wink wink, nudge nudge. (Lots of really good bits found in nature.) Formulated with natural, naturally-derived, and organic ingredients like coconut oil, our Eye Cream is safe for all skin types. At LilyAna Naturals, we believe its our responsibility to make the world a better place  for people and our planet we inhabit. We create products with natural ingredients that help your skin and wont harm your body, all neatly packaged inside containers that wont hurt the environment. We care deeply about the Earth. Our products are made with responsible, environmentally-friendly packaging that supports recycling programs, consumer demand, and reduces impact on landfills. We are proud to be part of the movement to reduce plastic waste by incorporating materials capable of reuse, such as PCR (post-consumer resin), reusable glass, and FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified paper made of responsibly sourced wood fiber. The FSC standard ensures responsible forestry practices, which have positive implications for water quality. Clean water is an integral part of the LilyAna Naturals promise. With every LilyAna Naturals purchase, you help support the Water is Life charity, which brings safe drinking water to under-resourced communities all over the world. It is our dream at LilyAna Naturals that our brand will bring sustainability and joy to our beloved customers on our journey to zero waste. Small Town Origins.
