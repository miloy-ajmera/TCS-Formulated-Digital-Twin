Fiji the Prize As Fisherman King Again 


li I— '' . 


The 1969 edition of The Daily 
Colonist King Fisherman Con* 
test la about to start, and the 
big prize is a trip to the South 
Pacific. 

The contest starts Saturday 
and will continue for six 
mmthi, ending Oct. 36. and the 
main hidden weight prize this 
year will be a Canadian Pacific 
Airlines trip for two to Fiji, 
There will be a grand array 


of other prizes, trophies and 
Prince Buttons for both monthly 
and contest-long competition. 

★ A ★ 

Entry forms now are being 
distributed to the more than 200 
King Fisherman weigh-in sta¬ 
tions on Vancouver Island so 
that, anywhere an angler fishes, 
he will be able to weigh in his 
catch, whether or not he 
subscribes to the Colonist. 


But you have to be a 
subscriber to get In on the 
major prizes like the vacation 
in Fiji and the aluminum cart<^ 
boat. 

Bill and EUeen Stephenson. 
307 Cadillac, know the value of 
being Colonist subscribers dur¬ 
ing the fishing season. 

Last year Bill entered a 6.12- 
pound spring (Chinook) salmon 
he caught at Pedder Bay and 


that fish was drawn as the big 
hidden winner of a Canadian 
Pacific Airlines trip for two to 
Hawaii. 

They take off in a luxury 
Canadian Pacific jet airliner 
May 8 and will tour the 
Hawaiian Islands until May 16. 

They will be guests of Shera- 
ton-Hawaii and the Inter-Islands 
Resorts during their holiday 
trip. 


They will stay at the Royal 
Hawaiian in Honolulu May 9 
through May 13. the Naniloa in 
Hilo May 14, Kona Inn May 15 
and Princess Kailulani May 16. 


They will be taken on tours in 
Hawaii and Oahu by Gray Lines 
and the Inter Island Trade Wind 
Tours. 

So, hy next Saturday, it will 


be time for all Vancouver 
Island anglers to make sure 
they are Colonist subscribers. 
Then all they have to do is 
catch a five pound salnton or a 
one pound trout or bass to win*a 
chance on the Fiji trip. 

The more fish entered, the 
mm-e chances in the big barrel 
— and each eptry will also get a 
chance o n monthly hidden 
weight draws.

tion of Machinists and Aeru- 
tpace Workers Saturday rejected

ond natlmwide walkout since

years ago. 

A total of 3.333 workers voted 
ap'ainst the Air Canada offer 
while 1,116 favored it. 

The union is seeking a 20 per 
cent wage increase in nne year 
and the airline is offering a 23 
per cent wage increase over a 
three-year period. The union 
executive recommended rejec¬ 
tion of the offer. 

‘COMPANY REGRETS' 

An Air Canada spokesman 
said Saturday night the com¬ 
pany "regrets the inconvenience 
that this action will impose upon 
the public." 

He added that some ticket

Village Stymied 

Farmer Picks Golf 
As Sex Substitute 


STOCKHOLM (Reuters) — Swedish farmer Bengt 
Granbcrg, 23. has abandoned a plan to run a group sex 
village on his 400-acre estate because Aaland Island 
authorities, disapproved and only seven persons — ail men — 
answered his first advertisement. 

Granberg Invested 3200,000 in the project and said last 
month visitors would be paired off during a ferry trip from 
Stockholm In the isliinri. 88 miles niirtheast of Iwre. They 
then could do "anything they like after 10 p.m." in 30 six-bed 
chalets. 

Granberg said hr now plans to construct n golf course in¬ 
stead. and use the village as "a normal holiday camp.”

PORT ALBERNI (Spe- 
cial)—A two-year-old girl 
and her parents died in a 
car-truck crash near Barn- 
field Saturday, bringing the 
number of traffic deaths in 
the Port Albeml area to 10 
in 14 days. 

The victims were MichaM 
Williams, 54, his wife Usa Mae, 
50, and their daughter Elsie. 
Their other childrefi, Frank, 15, 
and Lavem, 5, were taken to 
West Coast General Hospital, 
where they were reported to be 
in fairly good condition. 

GOING HOME 

ITte Williams family, members 
of the (Mtiaht Indian band, were 
on their way home to Sarita 
River, a small Ipgging and 
fishing community about 10 
miles from Bamfield. 

The accident involved Mr. 
Williams' car and a MacMillan 
Bloedel truck on a Franklin 
River logging road. It occurred 
at about 3;50 p.m. The two 
injured were flofwn out by 
Ocean Air ambulance. 

The family had been In Port 
Alberni earlier in the day on a 
shopping trip. 

BLIND BENDA 
Chief Art Peters of the Ohiaht 
band, who lives in Port Alberni, 
described the road where the 
accident happened as good, but 
narrow and full of blind bends. 
It was easier to drive at night 
when one could see lights 
coming around the bend. 

Chi^ Peters said Mr. Wil¬ 
liams’ death would be a great 
loss to the Indian community. 

"He was a fine man with a lot 
of foresight. He had done a lot 
of volunteer work and planning 
on toe new subdivision on the 
Indian reserve at Santa." 

Staff-Sgt. Roy Woodfin of the 
RCMP describ^ the 10 fatali¬ 
ties in the vicinity of Port 
.\lberni as "a queer run of 
events and likely only coin¬ 
cidence." 

SAFETY MEETING 
He said more than half the 
deaths occurred in the Parks- 
ville area. 

Aid. George McKrdght, who 
expressed concern Friday about 
the accidents, said Saturday he 
had arranged for a meeting of 
organizations who might be 
interested in highway safety. 

He commented: "The driving 
habits of people in this parti¬ 
cular locality are deplorable. 
For example you don't get 
courtesy at Intersections^’ 

He said he was preparing a 
brief whidi would propose a 
safety program involving 12 
local organizations. 

"One month out of each year, 
one group of the 12 will be 
responsible for conducting a 
safely program." 


Coach Line Drivers Vote Action 


Not Even Crestfallen 


Things don’t always go exactly ?ight 
In highest circles. At (government 
House Saturday, Lieutenant-Cjover- 
nor John R. Nicholson was invested as 
Knight of Grace of Most Venerable 
Order of Hospital of St. John of Jeru¬ 


salem, then shook hands of other 
guests, including Henry Field, left, oC

noticed his St. John badge had slipped

Tough Reaction Certain 
To Any Spy Ship Attack 


Strike Could Ground Tourists 


By DON COliJNA 
More than 100 drivers for 
Vancouver Island Coach Lines 
could be on strike when the 
tourist season movea into full 
swing. 

In a Victoria vote .Saturday, 
90 favored strike action, five 
opposed it and three ballots 
were spotted, according to 
union figures. 


The men are members of 
Local 234 of the Canadian 
Brotherhood of Railway, 
Transport and General 
Workers and drive out of 
Victoria on toe bus line's 
many routes, 

Joseph Simfwnn, president 
of the local, said he expected 
the company wotild be given 
72 hours strika notice Monday, 


The drivers would be free to 
strike within 90 days of the 
conclusion of the 73-huur 
period. 

Tlte vote followed a breal^ 
down in negotiations ana 
failure of a government 
mediator to effect an agree- 
menUon a new contract, Mr. 
Simpson said. 

The last agreement expired 


March 1. Negotiations began 
in December. 

Mr. Simpsim said the sides 
were far apart on several 
points, lihe main i^ue is 
wages. Details have not been 
disclosed. 

A strike would cut off the 
.company’s service to Camp- 
beil River. Port Alberni. (joUI

union. 

Also hard hit would bo the 
Gray Line Sightseeing Tours, 
Mr, Simpson said.

retaliation, without warning, for 
any future attack on U.S. intel¬ 
ligence ships or planes, respon¬ 
sible members of Congres-s said 
Saturday (Picture, Page 3h 

These sources said Nixon 
made this statement in review¬ 
ing with congressional leaders 
the reasons he feels it necessary 
to continue flights of electron¬ 
ics planes such as the one shot 
down in the Sea of Japan by 
North Korea. 

At his Friday news conference 
Nixon said "when planes of the 
United States and ships of the 
United Slates are in Interna-

GRIM NOTE 

The president, grimly noting 
the apparent loss of 31 Amer¬ 
ican lives in the latest incident, 
was reported by one of those 
present to have told fhe leaders 
that he means to go beyond the 
mere accompaniment nf the 
intelligence craft by fighters or 
warships.

TWO DESTROYERS 

On Wednesday, Capt. Thomas

came across two Soviet des¬ 
troyers in file search area and 
tried to establish contact to ask 
about possible survivors. 

"It never occurred to me that 
these people would be anything 
but friendly,” he said. "They 
were obviously trying to help Us 
in^is catastrophe.” 


replied the Americans would 
like to take a look. 

"Please don't fear." he told 
the Russians as the HC-130 
began descending. 

'The Russians said "come 
ahead,” Petit said, and the 
Amerioans saw a wheel, a 
ladder and some other aircraft

Then HlUyer headed tor the

the bait. He asked if she 
would like to shoot the next 
ball. She said yes, and he 
offered his cue. 

Before playing the first ball 
the young woman asked if she 
could finish the game if she 
sank the bail. The boys said 
yes and she sighted up. The 
Intruder cleared the table. 
Handing back the cue she 
said, "This is a bit light. I 
like an 18-ounce myself.”

Declaration of Intent 


Chinese

'Heavy ’ 


have begun a series o( harass¬ 
ing raids against the Jewish 
state, commando sources said 
In Beirut. 

The guerrillas, bolstered by> 
about 300 fresh aprivals. i 
launched four operatitms last' 
week in the border area, 
normally the quietest of all 
ceasefire lines with Israel. 

The Informants said the raids 
are likely to continue on tb(* 


From Wire Reports 

Diplomatic sources said in the 
UN Saturday the .Big Four UN 
ambassadors had tried and 
failed to agree on a declaration 
of intent for the Arabs and 
Israelis to sign in a move to 
settle their conflict. 

The informants said that 
because of disagreements, the 
chief delegates erf Britdin, 
France, the Soviet Uniwi and 
the United States had shelved 
the declaratkm idea Thursday 
at their fourfli session in search 
of a settlement. . 

The declaration, they ex- 
I plained, would have set forth 
what Israel, Egypt and Jordan 
Intended to do in line with i 
1967 Security Council resolution 
that calls for Israeli withdrawal 
from occupied Arab territory. 
Arab acknowledgment of Israeli 
sovereignty and other settle¬ 
ments. 

WHOI.E GONOEPT 

But the United States disliked 
the whole concept from the 
beginning, the Informants said, 
and the four fell into these' 
disagreements over the word- 
ing-

same scale, with no widespread 
spring offensive expected. 

They emphasized that the 
guerrillas consider the main 
front is in Jordan and flieretoi-c 
operations from Lebanon are 
only diversionary— ‘'just to; 
keep the Israelis worried a 
little." 

• Iran Saturday placed its 
armed forces on alert and 
Iranian troop concentrations 
were reported altmg the dis¬ 


puted Shatt A1 Arab River 
border with Iraq. 

Khosrow A f s b a r , Iranian 
deputy foreign minister, told thej 
Senate that Iraq is claiming the' 
40-mile waterway, where the 
Tigris and Euphrates run Into 
the Persian Gulf, as Iraqi 
territory. He declared null and 
void a pact signed with Iraq in 
1937 on navigation rights in the 
river. 

• On the war front, artil¬

Army commander said Satur¬ 
day the Chinese lost ''several 
hundred" men in battle with his 
men along the Sino-Soviet Ikh*-

Lt.-Col. Alexander l^n-

about 3,000 men into the battle 
on the disputed border island in 
Far East Asia. 

The March 15 battle was one 
of three major skirmishes for 
the island since March 2. 
Konstantinov was credited with

"It is hard to judge, since the

Political Party Report Soon 


Peking Session Stretches On 


Last Monday's communique 
said both the political report 
and the revised ccxistitution 
would be pubUshed. Observers 
here briieve these documents— 
Or at least the political report- 
may be pubU;d>ed before the 
congress ends. 

The political report will re¬ 
view the domestic and interna¬ 
tional situation, sum up the ex¬ 
perience gained during the Cul¬ 
tural Revolutiai, and outline the 
tasks ahead of the party. 

n'TlTlE PO§TCBE 

The report will therefore give j 
vital indications about Chlna’S| 
future international posture at a 
time when tensions have been 
raised in the Far East such as 
the Sino-Soviet border clashes 
and the downing of an Ameri¬ 
can spy plane by North Korea. 

This week, the cwigress has 
been discussing the third point 
of its agenda-the elect1<wi of, 
the new central committee, | 

HUGE GAPS 

The composition the new 
committee will reflect the huge 
gups in the party ranks caused 
by the Cultural Revolution and 
by the purges and natural deaths 
which have occurred in the 13 
years since the eighth congre» 
of 1956. 

The earlier communique con¬ 
firmed the revised constitution 
sets up Chairman Mao Tse- 
tung's thought as the party’s id¬ 
eological basis and named Un 
Piao as Mao’s successor. 


Observers said that the clos-i 
ing of the congress could be en-j 
nounced at any time. But it now! 
appears the session could last 
until some time next week. 

The congress now is in its 
19th day. « , 


China news agency have re¬ 
mained silent on the congress 
since last Monday when they 
announced the adc^tion of the 
political report delivered by De¬ 
fence Minister Lin Piao and of! 
the revised party constitutiem. | 


HONG KONG (AFP) — The

BONN — The three western 
allies responsible for security in 
West Berlin have rejected a 
request by the city government 
that they ban the rightwing 
National Democratic Party, 
Informed sources said Saturday. 

The retjuest. made by West 
Berlin Mayor Klaus Schuetz lust 
March 21. still is officially 
under con.^ideration. The city 
government's action wa<r 
designed to fend off u com-i 
munist propaganda eampaignj 
describing the western half ofi 
the divided city as a hotbed for{ 
Nazis. ■ 

Under Ihe occuiwtion slatutes.^l 
which still a|>ply to the city, thej 
western allies have the {xiwcr to 
outlaw nondomocratic parties 
there. 

1'NAM.MITY PRINCIPLE 
The U.S. and Britain werei 
against action and the French^ 
were reported in favor, In such| 
cases, the commandants oper¬ 
ate on the principle of \inanim-: 
Ity. ! 

Washington and L/indon werei 
said to lie against a move so 
long as the government in Bonn 
has n<H decided whether to seek 
a court ban on the party in 
West Germany. The French' 
were reported more concerned j 
over the threat to public ordc:

Northwest Passage 


T he 1968 DISCOVERY of oil at Prudhoe Bay on 
the northern slope of Alaska has been ranked of 
such significance as to make It a major consideration 
in the international oil industry. 

The find has been rated as the largest*ever in 
North America, possibly rivalling in richn^ the oils 
that lie under the desert san^ of the Middle East. 

( Ci^nnda's position in the discovery is at on(% a 
t^nus and a headache. The companies making the find 
Ivkve been American, and one of the largest possible 
beneficiaries may be the British Petroleum Ck>mpany 
io which the British Crown has a controlling interest. 

As the finds so far are on U.S. territory, Canada's 
Interest Is mainly an indirect one, although it affects 
to a possibly large degree the hiture of its own oil 
industry. 

If however, as most of the oil exploration 
companies working in the north are hoping, the finds 
spill over into the Northwest Territories and into the 
Canadian Arctic Islands new problems will arise, 
particularly so far as marketing and transportation 
are concerned. 

There does not at the moment appear to be any 
^at fear that Canada’s sovereignty over the Arctic 
Islands ceded by Britain in 1880 \rill be challenged. 
The U.S. has already accepted the fact in its past 
DEW line dealings with Canada; and Russia is not 
likely to interfere in case its own Arctic Islands are 
drawn into the dispute as well. 

However, the question as to who rules the Arctic 
waves, or more appropriately the Arctic icii is not 
quite so clear. 

Most of the straits and passes which In the past 
have proved navigable — under extreme difficulty, of 
course — are narrow and under the Geneva 
agreement most of them are to be regarded as 
Canadian territorial water. (This is based on the 12 
miles territorial water limit measured from headland 
tq headland.) 

Thus any attempts to move Alaska oil, or oil from 
t^e Canadian north, by the short-cut Arctic sea route 
t« Europe and other large oil markets, would probably 
hkve to use Canadian waters, and could only be moved 
\ilth Canadian consent. 

This summer the U.S. plans to send a mammoth 
oQ'tanker ice breaker, the Manhattan, to try to 
c^sh its way through the Northwest Passage and 
establish a p^ible route to Prudhoe Bay. 

j; Already there is evidence that the United States 
n|ay claim that such movement of its ships through 
narrow waters bounded by Canadian Islancte is a right, 
I'ither than an obligement by the Canadian 
government. 

It is perhaps true that some experts who have 
dantributed to the sovereignty of the north question 
ve making mountains out of mol^iOla. *or even 
efeating difficulties where none exist, but this Is not a 
l^e to allow of any weakening. The north must 
ramain neutral and if left in the hands of Canada It no 
dAubt will. But any concession by Canada of sovereign 
lights — on land or sea — could bring other nations 
speh as the United States and Russia into a 
competition that would put Canada and the world in 
an embarrassing position.

P REMIER W. A. C. BENNE7IT has now been ex¬ 
plicit about the kind of free ambulance service he 
^pects the municipalities to provide with the aid of 
rarovincial per-capita grants. He doesn't mean the 
wergency service which numbers of them are 
pl^viding now — and for which the $1 per capita 
(tesignated as ambulance aid would in some cases pay. 

means free transportation to and from hospital for 
anyone who requires it, “irrespective of means, but 
fiiecording to physical needs." 

^ The municipalities may spend for this purpose the 
v^ole $3 per capita increase in provincial grants this 
year, Mr. Bennett says, but if they have something 
Irft over, it must go to purposes of the other $2 of 
the increase, encouragement of industrial ^eiopment 
qpd tourist promotion. 

< But $1 a >«ar a resident is an absurdly low figure 
flBr the provision of a full ambulance service. The 
^imate cited by Mayor Ray Bryant of Esquimalt for 
the Greater Victoria municipalities, more than 
IBOO,000, is in line with a provincial estimate some 
^e ago that a sendee for all of B.C. would cost 
9.500,000. And $500,000 is more than the total of the 
Greater Victoria municipalities’ $3-a-head grant 
increases. 

As it must be seen now, therefore, Mr. Bennett U 
calling upon the municipalities to increase their tax 
rates one way or another. They can institute the free 
ambulance service and pay something over and above 
what the province will contribute, with the Social 
Credit government taking the cheers and the local 
councils the gi'oans. Or they can decide not to give 
free ambulance service and do without the S3 a 
person, when in their budget computations they have 
been counting on it. 

No cheers. Mote groans. 

The pattern is familiar. The trouble for Mr. 
Bennett, especially if he is contemplating an election 
this year, may be that it is too familiar and the wound 
for local taxpayers still too sore.

Current Controversy Recalls Century-Old Debate 


B.C. Ban on School Bible Readings in Force Until 1944 



The current cMitroversy over Bible reading in 
the public schools may see British Cohunbia repeat 
a debate fought out <me century ago, ending with 
banning of Bible reading In the classrooms. 

And If the Bible goes for a second time, then paradoxi¬ 
cally the eventual result could well be a new renaissance of 
living to the Golden Rule. 

Last week the Vancouver # 

School Board voted six to two

The B.C. Teachers’ Federa¬

p^cy “(hat religious exer¬ 
cises shoidd be discontinued in 
B.C. public schools.” 

And of course there was the 
epochal derision in June. 1963, 
by the U.S. Supreme Court, 
that recitation of the Lord's 
Prayer and Bible readings 
could hot be required in pid>lic 
schools by either the state or 
local authority. 

Today’s requirement that 
toe schools be non • sectarian 
as long as they are Christian 
is an affrcxit to many chOdren 
from non-Christian homes. In 
a couple of Victoria ele¬ 
mentary schools East Indians 
and Chinese youngsters make 
up about one-quaiter of the 
enrolment.

The Christian devout 
claimed Robson wanted "god¬ 
less schools,” but public 
opinion favored Robson’s 
stand. 

In Manto, 1669, B.C.'s first 
public schools act made the 
schools non-sectarian. The 
sdwol regulations said: 

“. . . No peraon shall re¬ 
quire any pupil to read or 
stu(j^ In or from any religious 
book, or to Join in any 
exercise of devott<m or re- 
]igi<xi objected to by his

“When we reach a suffici¬ 
ently high level of spiritual 
and emotional maturity we 
will come to realize that true 
religious insight is not at¬ 
tained by formal instruction 
in s subject called 'rebglon' at 
all, but through a deepening 
ot feeling and underst^lng 
inter-penetrating aU sidijects. 

‘Tt is not a matter of words 
at all, but of attitudes and 
actions.” 

Ihis is what some school 
districts in B.C. already are 
trying to do as toey realize 
toat so-called “sex education” 
is based on respect for human 
life. Ihe Greater Victoria

so who admitted they didn't,

That’s not exactly non- 
aeotarian education. 


Here’s what the Public 
Schools Act says at present; 

“AB public schools shall be 
opened by the reading, with¬ 
out explanation or comment, 
of a passage of Scripture to 
be selected from readings 
prescribed or approved by the 
Council ot Public BKtruction. 
The reading of the passage of

It’s no good today to 
pretend that Christian princi¬ 
ples are being preserved by a 
section of the Putdic Schorii 
Act. School Bible readings as

He knew deep down, I think, 
that Mr. Berger was toe best 
man to lead to lead toe party 
at this time. But he fears toe 
power of labor unions in poli¬ 
tics and was also looking 
ahead. TTmt's why he picked 
Mr. Wiltiams, whose growth 
since he was first elected in 
1966 holds promise of consid¬ 
erable politioal stature by 1978 
or thereabouts. 

There is still a large seg¬

Mr. Strachan probably among 
toMn — who feel that toe

FULL PRICE 


The really sad aspect of the 
whole affair, from the view¬ 
point ot those who would like 
to see toe NDP knock Social 
Credit out of the government, 
is that the unl<m leaders 
•imply cannot deliver a block 
vote. The majority of uqion 
members, like any one else, 
will continue to vote as they 
see fit. 

So. as I see it. the NDP has 
all the disadvantages of such 
a close association, with few 
of the compensating advant- 
ages.

Tuesday Gordon Dowding, 
MLA for Burnaby-Edmonds

supporters of rival Dave

On neither occasion, how¬ 
ever. was former leader 
Robert Strachan present, and 
there Is no way toat ttds can 
be glossed over. 

Even on the night of Mr, 
Berger’s victory, when the 
defeated candidates clustered 
around in the glare of tele¬ 
vision lights showing good 
grace in defeat, Mr. Strachan 
was upstairs In his room. He 
had laryngitis, it's true, but 
there was no need for him to 
make a speech — just to raise 
Mr. Berger’s hand.

Concern over the closer 
reiationship with labor unions, 
which Mr. Berger favora, is, 
not only felt among rank and 
file members of the party and 
individuals like Mr. Strachan 
in the higher echelons. It 
concerns probably as many as 
12 of the 17-member caucus. 

The effect of Mr. Straehan’s 
e\’c-of-baIloting disclosure that 
he would not suppMt Mr. 
Barrett, as most felt he 
would, was like s bombshell. 
Afterwards the committtee 
rooma of the man upon whom 
anti-Berger forces had pinned 
Iheir hopes was filled with 
bitterriess and recriminations 
of the kind voiced by that 
ammymous MI-A. 


The More for 
Your Mo»^ Oor 


THE PICK OF hnch 


Feelings are running high, 
particularly within the party's 
inner council, over Mr. 
Strachan's behavior at the 
convention. Oie MLA who 
supported Mr. Barrett, was 
overheard after the final 
result, saying bitterly: 
“Strachan's lost his mind. 
This is the culmination of 13 
years of political ineptitude.” 

Mr. Strachan, it seems to 
me. has Always regarded the 
formation of toe NDP as a 
kind of shotgun marriage 
between the old OCF party 
and organized labor.

However, Mr. Strachan re¬ 
mained a loner to the end. 
doing what he thought was 
right. He wasn't interested in 
simply defeating Mr. ^rger. 
much as he would have liked 
to see toil happen, but in 
doing what was best for the 

party- 

Perhaps Mr. Berger's forces 
already had the convention 
at'Wn up, I don’t know. But 
the endorsement pf Mr. Wil¬ 
liams certainly hurt Mr. Bar¬ 
rett's chances, and Mr. Wil¬ 
liams' withdrawal in his favor 
after the' first ballot was 
doomed to failure from the 
beginning. 

Perhaps Mr. Strachan could 
have caused an upset by using 
the emotion generated by his 
farewell address to the con¬ 
vention to make an impas- 


Ever since 1961, and prob¬ 
ably before that, he has 
fought with a ccaisiderabie 
degree of success to keep 
labor from exercising as 
much control as some union 
leaders would like to exercise 
witltin the party. 

Right up to his final speech.

successor b egan, Mr. 
Strachan pleaded for recogni-

Pulp-Paper Stocks Back in Favor I Push-Button Phone Next 


By HARRY YOUNG 
Bualneai Editor 

After being in the wilderness . 
Inr the past two or three years, 
Canada's pulp-and-paper stocks 
fire back again, commanding 
investors' attention. 

Recent annual reports by 
Canada’s leading firms in the 
Industry have indicated Quite 
clearly the demand tor news¬ 
print is again clintoing and the 
S5-a-ton increase imposed, at the 
beginning of the year is going to 
offset much of the higher costs 
of production. , 

Further, the depressed pulp 
market has twice already this , 
year shown signs of stiffening . 
by reducing the discounts from 
the posted prices. Wiile dis¬ 
counts are etill available, they 
may not be for very long. 
DIFFICULT TASK 
"It is very difficult to pick up 
various kinds of pulp on the 

open market at the present 

time,” sard a spokesman for one 
West Coast pulp producer. 

TTie period of overcapacity, 
which has plagued the industry 
In the West lor the past few 
years, is no longer such a 
handicap as it was a few 

months ago. Some mills are 

already boosting their rates of 
production to catch up to the 
improved market. 

SCANDINAVIA 

One of the features about the 
renewed buying interest in pulp 
is that Scandinavia, the main 
Kuropean rival to North Ameri¬ 
can pulps, has reached the peak 
nf its productive capacity, and 
the rising demand of European 
pulp users is being forced into 
North American channels. 

With the pulp-and-paper 
market improving, investors 
have recently been adding to 
their hokUngs of the depressed 
stodffi of the major Canadian 
pulp-and-paper companies. 

SOME STOCKS 
Some of these stocks are. of 
rourse, well above their 1967-68 
Inws. T\vo notable examples are 
B-C. Forest Products, up from 
about SIS to S37. and MacMillan- 
Binede). up from 919 to $38. 

However, both these West 
Coast companies, while big in 
the pul[vand-paper .business are 
even bigger in the lumber and 
plywood fields. The stock mar¬ 
ket value growth of these 
companies is Msed more on the 
huge Increases in lumber prices 
rather than on their pulp-and- 
paper prospects. 

EASTERN FIRMS 
The eastern pulp-and-papcr 
companies, such as Domtar, 
Abitibi, Consi^dated Bathurst 
and Price Co., are in a rather 
different position. They are 
more dependent upon pulp and 
paper than on lumber prices. As 
a result, their shares have not 
appreciated to the same degree 
as MacMillan and B.C. Forest. 

One of the sidelights to the 
improvement in the pulp-and- 
paper market is that this is one 
of Canada’s main sources of 
export income, and any im¬ 
provement in demand or in 
price structure is of .inrportance 
to the national economy. 

O 

GOLD’S LATEST BOOSTER 
A man who provided the local 
press with news about the oil 
Industry in Canada shortly after 
Imperial Oil brought in its 
Leduc well back in 1947, is 
convinced precious metals and 
particularly gold, are the only 
lafe investments. 

The new disciple of gold is C. 
V. Myers, who some time ago 
sold his Oilweek magazine to a 
national printing house, and now 


is publisher of a financial 
newsletter ~ Financial Review. 

Myers thinks investors should 
sell their securities and with the 
resultant cash buy gold, or 
other precious metals. 

A PESSIMIST 

He believed the fight against 
inflation is a losing cause and 
that sooner or later the potiti- 
cians with their “worthleBS 
lOUs and free-spending habits” 
will' plunge the world Into a 
worse crash than 1929. 

Just about a year ago, Myers 
got himself into trouble with the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission when export copies 
of his newsletter were found to 


be urging American citizens to 
buy gold—a purchase which is 
contrary to the U.S. law. j 

An angry SEC filed a com-, 
plaint in a Maryland court, buti 
when Myers was asked to! 
appear in defence, the Calgary 
ecOTomist wired back telling 
them to "go to hell.” 

POOR PROPHET 

But that so far is about all the 
satisfaction Myers has had. His 
predictions that the two-tier 
gold price system adopted last 
year would fail, have not proved 
correct, and the world’s leading 
currencies are still Intact, if 
slightly battered. 

Myers is not greatly Im- 


Only Few Ribs Left 

Only Skelton remains of former Canadian Pacific 
Railway’s freight sheds on BellevUle. Workmen con¬ 
tinued to pick away at buildings ribs last week as 
structure is being removed for future waterfrmit 
development trf Victoria’s Inner Harbor.—(William 
E. Jolm) 


pressed, either, with the claim 
of the investment industry that 
the only way to beat Inflatlonls 
to buy equlUes. 

He has a lot of facts and 
figures to show the average 
investor doce not make money 
on the stock exchange, and that 
few break even, let alone 
making any headway against 
inflation. But lots of people who 
have selected their Canadian 
portfolios carefully will find it 
difficult to agree. 

CAPITAI, GAIN 

Is a lump of gold as good as a 
lOO-per-cent capital gain, such 
as has been made in the past 12 
months by many Canadian 
securities? 

Like his counterpart in the 
U.S., M. J. Baxter of New York. 
Myera is not going to find it 
easy to hold hli eonverts. 

BUDGET IN THE RED? 

One of my sharp-eyed invest¬ 
ment business friends In Vic¬ 
toria has pointed out that the 
latest edition of Loans of the 
Government of Canada” pub¬ 
lished half-yearly by the Bank 
of Canada has just come out in 
a bright red binding. 

“For years this b(»k has been 
covered witit the traditional 
green paper beloved of the 
(Dttawa civil service,” said my 
friend. 

“I hope the change to red Is 
not related to the state of the 
national economy?” 


LARGEST SHARE 

Most people on being asked 
who is the largest ^areholder 
of MacMillan-Bloedel might be 
inclined to answer quickly 
"Canadian Pacific Investments, 
of course.” 

Yet tiiey would be wrong. The 
2,155.900 ^ares of htB held by 
CPI represents 10,3 per cent ol 
the total common stock capital, 
but It atill has to take second 
place. 

The biggest holding, according 
to the Information circula 
which MB aent out with its 
request for proxies to the 
annual general meeting, is that 
of The Wiscon^n Oorp. 

BIGGER PART 

It holds 2.836,500 MB shares, 
or 13.5 per cent of the total. 

A note In the circular aayi 
Prentice Bioedel, the retired 
vice-chairman of the company, 
Is the owner of a ben^cial 
interest in the Wisconsin Corp 

When the old H.R. MadMlUan 
Export Co. was merged with 
Bfoedel Stewart and Welsh, the 
shareholders of tiie latter com 
pany acquired a large amount 
of stock in the new company, 
and most of It went to the 
Bioedel family. 

’The Bioedel hiding was, of 
course, diluted in 1959 when in 
another amalgamation Powell 


River G>. became part ol the 
MacMillan complex. 

The biggest individual holder 
listed among the iwesent direc¬ 
tors is the GOM of the, 
company, Harold R. MacMdlan. 
Despite lavish charitable gifts 
and donations, tiie founder ct 
the company still owns benefi¬ 
cially 560,187 shares. 

J. V. Clyne, the present 
chairman and chief executive 
officer, is listed as holder of 
40,000 rtiares, while RobMl 
Bonner with 50 Aares has UtUe 
more than a nominal holding .

London Signals End of U.S. Money Pinch 


Ry JOHN*^LAHRENCE 

liONDCW (LAT) — Could the 
first hint of an easing in the 
U S. money pinch come from as 
far away as here? 

Tlie answer is maybe. For 
just when it appeared money 
conditions would be tighter than 
ever and American banks would 
be increasing efforts to draw 
funds from.^ Europe, bankers 
here believe') they see things 
cooling down just a bit. 

Since April 1, several Euro¬ 
pean nations have attempted to 


reduce toe outflow of dunds 
h-om their countries into U.S. 
banks. This came at the aame 
time toe U.S. federal reserve 
system clamped tighter reserve 
requirements on banks, thus 
reduce toe outflow funds 
for loans. 

Yet In toe face of all this new 
[H-essure on the money supply,: 
interest rates paid to attract 
Eurodollar deposits have edged 
downward, ending at least two 
months of sharp climb. Euro¬ 
dollars, siihply slated, are U.S.

JUNEAU. Alaska (AP) — 
Rep. Richard Borer, (R—Cor¬ 
dova), said r~*t>l)] he has 
proposed would help rid Alaskan 
waters of commercial fishermen 
from "outside,” meaning such 
places as Washington state and 
British Columbia. 


Kennedy Institute at Tilburg's Roman 
Catholic University. 

The official report on the meeting 
was written by Paul Bareau, econo¬ 
mic adviser to the British publishing 
group IPC, who said in an Interview 
that he was struck by the optimism 
among the participants on the future 
of special drawing rights, the "paper 
gold” designed by international agree¬ 
ment to take a place in the reserves 
of the nations of the world. 


TILBURG (AP) — The official 
price of gold should remain unchang¬ 
ed at $35 an ounce, a group of mone¬ 
tary experts meeting in this Nether¬ 
lands city agreed Saturday. 


"I dcm’t believe that just 
because a man's a commercial 
fisherman in Puget Sound or on 
the Columbia River he should 
be able to come up here," Borer 
told the Alaska House resources 
committee. 

His bill would lestablish a 
state commercial fisherman's 
Ucennng board, and six regional 
I boards would have the power 
ito decide who received licences 
I in dieir respective areas. 


"A minority opinion favored" a 
substantial increase in the price,” 
their final report said, "but this was 
jud,ged by the majority to be a regres¬ 
sive method of increasing world re¬ 
serves and one which could distribute 
its immediate favors unfairly.”

He predicted thq first issue would 
be made in 1970. 

The report said it would be highly 
desirable to link the Communist coun¬ 
tries into a worldwide monetary sys¬ 
tem, but that this does not seem 
“realizable in the near future.” 


Borer said he wanted to get 
rid ot “people who go back to 
Seattle and live in the winter. I 
just want to cut tiiem out; I’m 
tired of them." 


The experts' opinions emerged in 
three days of dlsoisslon on The Fu¬

Although reluctant to give 
up tbe 27-year-old Harrelson, 
who hit two home runs

deal. 

Harrelson hit 35 home runs 
in his first full season with 
Boston in 1968. 

He signed with Boston as a 
free agent In August, 1967. 
after being released by Kan¬ 
sas City owner Charles Finley 
for uncomplimentary remarks 
over the firing <rf Alvin Dark 
as manager of the A's. 

Oaric is now manager of Uir

Siebert. who had a 61-47 
record and a 2.75 earned run 
average in five years al 
Cleveland, enjoyed his best 
years in 1965 and ' 66 . when he 
ixwted Identical 1&9 marks.

structure and constitution of a 
single church amalgamating the 
Canadian Anglican and United 
Churches was sent back to 
committee for further study 
Friday by the General Commls- 
siem OR Union. 

Commissioners withheld 
approval in principle of the 
ecsisUtutiona] committee's re¬ 
port and asked for more study 
on the functlotu of the bishop 
and the dloeele In relatl«m to 
local churches. 

The constitutional committee 
had suggested that a unified 
church be organized as a 
general assembly broken down 
into regional conferences, 
dioceses and pastoral zones. 
PASTORAL ZONE 

It was the pastoral zone 
concept In particular that led 
the 5(^member geaeral commis¬ 
sion to defer approval ol the 
report. 

Anglican Bishop H. R. Hunt of 
Tonnito, committee chairman 
wdio presented the constitution 
report, said the pastoral zone 
meant a nlimber of congrega- 
ti<mB grouped together to'share 
various ministers m 'h team 
basis. 

He said the ministry might 
tiien be more specialized—with 
ail clergymen sharing in sacra- 
mmtal woiic, but each engaging 
in specific aspects of ministerial 
endeavor. 

Prof. John L. J. Edwards of 
TOTonto, an Anglican repre¬ 
sentative, said he had an

For years we’ve been telling you to buy a Volvo, 
keep It long enough to get out from under car pay¬ 
ments, and save your money for aomething tag. 

Now we've come up with something big for you 
to spend it on. 

The new Volvo' 164 

This ia Volvo’a largest, fastest, and plushest sedan. 

It Was designed for people who believe that some¬ 
how It’s poasible to build high performance and ex¬ 
ceptional comfort into a tmod looking car that will 
stand up to years — yet still cost less than a year's 
salary. 

Idealists they may be. 

But for them the 164 may be the ideal car. 

0 to 60 in 10.5 seconds isn’t uncommon 
60 to 0 in 3i» seconds is 

Even with its powerful three-litre, six cylinder en¬ 
gine the Volvo 164 can’t keep up with a Ferrari. 

On the other hand, pick-up Is, faster than the 
Mercedes 250, giving you all the speed you require 
to move into expressway traffic courageously. 

But when discretion is the better part of valor 
and you want to stop quickly, the 164 is unique. 

Ihe huge elevcn-lnch disc brakes bring the car 
from 60 miles per hour to a straight stop in Just 3.5 
seconds. A feat usually achieved only by racing cars. 


MOT^O^S L.TDV 


Test-Alve cme Just for the thrill of stopping It. 

You don't pay extra 
to get a complete car 

0)sUy options are not required to make a 164 
habitable. 

Power steering, four-wheel power disc brakes, bucket 
seats upholstered in leather, full carpeting, windshield 
washer, tinted glass, white sidewall tires, two out¬ 
side rearview mirrors, trip mileage counter, and elec¬ 
tric rear window defroster are included in the base 
price. 

For the man with money 
to spend, not burn 

Taken as a whole, the 164 is a reallitio car. 

When you buy one, you ore not made to feel as 
though you should have brought references. Nor are 
you expected to pay extra to the privilege of driving 
Volvo's best car when you have It serviced. The 164 
has been designed in the same straightforward man¬ 
ner as any other Volvo. 

It's also built to be as Indestructible as any other 
Volvo. <9 out erf every 10 Volvos registered here in 
the last eleven years are still on the roed.) 

Of course, we can’t prmiise you the 164 will last 
eleven years. But in three years you 
should be pocketing the money you'd J 

normally spend for a new car. > \ 

Showing everybody that it’s true rVOEiVO^ 
what they say about the rich getting i p ^ 
richer. J

TERRIFIC 


BEFOBS 


AFTER 


A\hen th# B.C. Wlldlif* 
Federation holds its annual 
conventiwi in New Westmin- 
Bter May 7 to 10, delegates 
representing every area In 
B.C. will be hammering out 
the most comprehensive fish* 
ing policies ever discussed by 
the 20,000-member group irf 
fishermen, hunters and con¬ 
servationists. 

Twenty^r resedutions con¬ 
cerning the problems of sports 
fishermen will be debated and 
36 of these resulted from the 
recent st^elhead workshop 
held in Nanaimo. 

The federatim is to be 
congratulated on the tlneere 
thought and research that has 
gone into the resolutions. 

Cover Strip 

One asks that logging oper¬ 
ators leave a atrip of cov^r 
bordering streams and lakes, 
adequate for protection ot the 
area in relati<m to water 
temperatures, silting and 
shade for fish. 

Another asks the practice of 
destroying primary growth 
cov?r such as alder and 
maple by the use of poisonous 
sprays be discwiUnuiKl. 

Resolution after resolution 
hits at tiM very core of the 
problems tiiat have been 
resulting in declining fish 
populations . , . and answers 
•re proposed. 

Stricter measures are called 
for to ensure logging debris is 
removed properly during log¬ 
ging operations, so log Jams 
and obstnetions do not hinder 
runs of spawning fish. 

More Rigid 

Another resohitiMi calls for 
more rigid regulations regard¬ 
ing gravel removal from 
known spawning areas of 
streams. 

More rigid regulations are 
also asked regarding the 
diversion of water for irriga¬ 
tion purposes. 

Heavier fines are asked for 
the dumping of car bodies and 
general refuse into streams. , 
One resolution calls for 
strengthening of fish protec¬ 
tion in the Water Act by 
realizing fish in the act. No 
consideration to fish is given 
in the existing act. 

Another asks the Federal 
Fisheries Act be amended to 
recognize silt as harmful to 
fish. 

Below Dams 

Revaluation of flows below 
dams is called for in another 
resolution. 

Wildlife members are will¬ 
ing to work to impro^’C their 
fishing. 

Members will discuss A 
proposal the wildlife federa¬ 
tion cooperate with the pro 
vineial fish and wildlife 
branch to undertake atream 
improvement projects, includ¬ 
ing foe depositing of sizeaUe 
rock base to create additional 
holding water for steelhead. 

A program of artifteiai 
stocking of steelhead is asked 
for. and It Is suggested such a 
program would include both 
winter and summer-run steel¬ 
head. in both rivers that have 
dwindling steelhead runs and 
in rivers where there are no 
steelhead runs. The resolution 
suggests steelhead stocking be 
a co-operative effort between 
provincial and federal fish 
departments. 

Own Fishing 

Members are prepared to 
cut back on their own fishing 
pleasures to increase fish 
stocks. Hiey propose a 12-inch 
fish limit be placed on 
Btreams with heavy steelhead 
runs and heavy fishing pres¬ 
sure. Kxisting size limit in 
rivers is eight inches, and 
many steelhead smolts are 
taken as trout. 

It is suggested the nmi- 
resident angler total catch 
limit be reduced to 10 steel¬ 
head A year. Now non-resi¬ 
dents can take 40 steelhead a 
year, the same as resident 
anglers. 

Tiie mandatory retuni of 
Steelhead punchcards is called 
for in another resolution and 


another suggests a 12 charge 
for a steelhead punehcard to 
replace the exlating 2^eent 
charge. Additional money 
would be earmarked fta- steel¬ 
head management. 

Fly Streams 

^There is a divergence of 
opinion on fly-fishing-only 
streams. 

A resolution presented by 
the f?dsrati(si’s freshwater 
fisheriei ewnmlttee Asks cer¬ 
tain areas of certain rivers 
and streams be set aside for 


fly fishing only on an experi¬ 
mental basis. 

But a resolutitm from the 
Port Coquitlam and District 
Hunting and Fishing Club 
voices fears that “restrictions 
m^e to satisfy “group prefer- 
eoMS could have adverse 
effects on goodwill, sports¬ 
manship and public opinion," 
and suggests "all natural 
water systems remain open 
for any and aU legal types ot 
spMt flshirc, unless a specific 
type of sport fishing proves 
detrimental to fish life."

Haunts 

Venetians 


VENICE, Italy (AP) ~ 
They are putting in an 
elevator at the famous Doges' 
Palace, but the custodians 
won’t use it to go to the top 
floor at night. 

They say they would walk 
strai^t into the ghost of 
Giacomo Casanova, the great 
Italian adventurer and lover 
who spent several years 
mouldering in (he attic, along 
with hundreds of other per¬ 
sons. 

Despite the ghost, Venice 
authorities have decided to 
open the palace for tourists 
every evening.

The high dungeons of the 
Pionbi — named for the 
leaden roof covering them —

sance when prisoners were 
herded from the Doges' Pal¬ 
ace across the celebrated 
Bridge ot Sighs for their last 
trial.

Sef of Rules 

Anofoer resolution suggests 
resort owners and guides be 
asked to dtacourage fishing 
regulation violators by posting 
signs on their pronises draw¬ 
ing attention to the regula¬ 
tions and the pmalties for 
violations. 

Fears are expressed in one 
resolution that as human 
population increases, more 
and more water frontage is 
being taken up for home and 
commercial use, and that 
resulting human exploitaticm 
and destruction have ruined 
the spawning and rearing 
potential of many of these 
streams. 

It asks that a aet of rules 
and regulations be instituted 
by foe govemm^t to maks 
•ure purchasers of any prt^ 

I erty that includes a spawnings 
I stream would have to safe¬ 
guard foe unimpeded passage 
of migratory fish. It also 
suggests provincial and fed¬ 
eral authorities co-operate in 
a program to rehabilitate 
streams already damaged. 

ChumView 

A pn^am is suggested 
whereby fish and wildlife club 
members and otiter interested i 
persons could be anninted 
voluntary fish wardens to 
improve, p(4ice and advla* on 
spawning grounds in specified 
creeks. 

The new Cowiehan Bay 
chum salmcn fishery comes 
up for discussion In a regula¬ 
tion that asks tor restrictions 
on the sale of roe for bait. 

In jnesenting foe resolution, 
foe Cowiehan Fish and Game 
Association luggests "a flag¬ 
rant disregard for regulations 
has been accelerated by foe 
taking of chum salmon for the 
purpose of processing bait in 
the form of pickled eggs end | 
paste." 

Early Coho 

A res<riuti<m from the Vic¬ 
toria Pish and Game Club 
calls for the development of 
early coho production by 
l»ovlding protecti<m from 
herring netting and salmon 
netting pressures by estab- 
listonent of salmon reserves 
where netting would be ex- 
. eluded.

Chaplin occasionally leaves

Vevey. Friends sometimes 
spot him walking around his

Mississippi highway patrol units 
were on du^ in ttie small town 
to enforce a dusk to dawn 
curfew in the outbreak of 
vicdence following Jackscn'a 
death. 

Authorities had said Jackson 
was shot and killed during a 
struggle with Wolf and Henry 
MoKewon, a Negro officer. The 
shooting allegedly to(^ place 
when the two officers went to 
Jackson's house to arrest him 
tor Interfering with an officer. 

McKewcn was slightly 
wounded by the same bullet 
that killed Jackson. 

ANGRY MARCH 

After the shooting, vigry 
Negroes marched to ^ court¬ 
house and later began throwing 
bricks and rocln at passing 
ears. A highway patrolman was 
wounded when aufitorlties 
moved in to disperse the crowd. 

QvU rights leader Charles 
Evers angrily denounced the 
shooting Saturday and led a 
protest march of 300 Negroes to 
the courthouse. He called the 
shooting "cold blood" murder 
and called for dismissal of the 
two officers. 

The warrant said Wdf “did 
wltoout the authorization of law 
and with premeditation and 
deliberate design, to effect the 
death of Roosevelt Jackson, a 
human being; kill and murder 
the said Roosevelt Jackson 
while shooting him with a gun." 
A preliminary hearing was 
scheduled tor Monday. 

Evers said the widow. Mrs. 
Jessie Jackson, asked for an 
autopsy and charged in her 
affidavit that Wolf and Mo¬ 
Kewon were holding her hus¬ 
band, one at each arm, when 
Wolf "shot him deliberately." 

Evers, a candidate for mayor 
in the nearby town of Fayette, 
charged Jackson was “shot in 
cold blood, for no reason at all.'* 

Re urged an ‘'intensified'* 
economic boycott of local mer¬ 
chant! in support of fite demand 
for tte dismissal of the two 
oMcers. 

There were no incidents dur¬ 
ing the march, which began at a 
local church and moved to the 
courthouse under turveilanee of 
local officers and highway pat¬ 
rolmen. 


■peedtng, a man was killed in a 
crash at a speed estimated by

“What If your nose is too

nose can increase in size until 
middle age. If your face Is 
plump, your nose may look 
small. Take off some weight 
and it will look larger. 

“How do you care for your 
nose in active sports?" 


By KITTB TUBMC!1L 

- Does your nose annoy you? 
Bob says his is too big. 
Kathy’s is too small. Sue’s 
nose is stuffed up all summer. 
“They call me Susie Sniffles." 
And Dick has had his brdeen 
twice in footbsll. "They call

To help teenagers like 
these, I inquired of the men 
who know noses best, doctors 
who specialize in otolaryngol- 
ogy and teach at the Medical 
School at foe University of 
Soufoero California. 

My relayed questions often 
asked by teenaeers follow:

There’s very little surgical 
risk, the doctors assured me. 
You may have to stay 24 to 48 
hours in the hospital and take 
a week off from school or 
work. Ask your famUy doctor 
about a specialist for tiu, a

When you sndm, enter a

Is removed and this may 
cause dryness and bleeding.

nothing to worry about. Ask 
your family doctor about the

may be due to an awkward

As you know, it is our custom to distribute free garden 
seeds every spring to followers of tbis column •- we have 
been doU^ this ever since 1953 — and today I am happy to 
announce our third free seed cdXer of 1B69, this time seeds of 
an outstandingly lovely flower commonly called the African 
Daisy. 

In most cases, my search for new and unique seeds for our 
Colonist readers is a tedious and somewhat painful procesa. 
It Involves consdderable oofrespondence with horticultural 
experimental statlcms in various parts of the world, followed 
by a ruthless discarding c4 ail but the most protnislng kinds. 

Once in a while, though, this kmg and involved routine la 
miraculously by-passed, and the seeds I am seeking dn^ into 
my lap almost as If magic. And so it is with these seeds of 
the A^ican Daisy. 


able to down an oTficial name for them, as the botanists 
can’t agree just what blood lines have gone into the make-up 
of thla hybrid flower, 

' In fact, tiiere is a strong suspicion that one of the parents 
is an entirely different flower — not a Dlm«TJhotheca at all 
- which would make our flower a bi-generic hybrid, which is 
a very rare critter Indeed in the hortfctdtural world. So. until 
the botanical experts get things sorted out, we'll call- our 
flowo- simply African Daisies. ;

TTtese plants stand a little better than a foot tall, making 
a rounded mound of dainty foMage about 14 Inches across, 
arid the plants cover themselves wllli daisy-Mke flowers with 
delicately pointed petals, up to Sti inches across. G^dors 
range through lemon, cream, apricot, salmon, white, pink and ^ 
deep orange, some with a wide band of dark blue at the base .V 
of the pet^s and with a silvery sheen, almost like a bul!t-IniC 
radiance. 4 

The disc in the centre of the flower seems to diange^ 
color with the angle of the light — at one time a golden a 
brown, while a minute later a deep navy blue. The stems amf 
straight and wiry and the flowers very good for cutting, t 
although they DO close up at night. The plants wifl trderate ■ 
heat, drought, neglect — ahnost anything except lack of a 


Some months ago I wrote a piece for this column listing 
and describing some of the sunny and daisy-like folwers that 
have come to us from South Africa, and when I came to one 
■tailed Dimorphotheca, I really let myself go, (or this 
exquisite Jewel has long been a favorite in our garden. 

A few weeks after the article appeared in the paper, a 
tetter arrived from a perfect stranger, poatmaiked 
Johannesburg, South iUnca, compUmenting me on the arti<^ 
and thanking me for the "plu"” for African flowers. 

My new-found African friend agreed with my descriptionB 
in the main, but when It came to the Dimorphotheea, his 
words were; "You ain’t seen nothin’ yet!’’ 

Apparently there has been a big change in this flower 
since I started growing them. There are several different 
varieties of Dimorphotheea, and in certain sectiona of tiie 
Transvaal the busy little bees have been flitting from flower 
to flower, giving liae to a new race of natural hybrids which 
are so much finer and in such a wide range of lovely colors 
that the little orange daisy in my garden Is as outdated as a 
Model T Ford.

My Johanne^rg correspondent offered to send me some 
seeds of these new hybrids to try out — I imagine be had in 
mind perhaps a couple of packets — so it was with some 
trepidation 1 wrote and asked if he could put me in touch 
w ith a grower who could supply roe with enough seeds for

And did you see Mrs. Rc^rs 
react when her husband said 
he didn't believe the Soviets 
would use it? I Just had to sit 
there like a dummy." 

“I think you’ve got the idea 
of these cabinet meetings all 
wrong. The president invited 
the wives so they will get 
more interested in their hus¬ 
bands’ jolM. I should have 
thought you would be intrigued 
with that."

ize you took everything to 
heart. The Whole point of the 
exercise wsisn't to show each 
other how bright we were. We 
were conducting toe nation's 
business." 


"It would at least have Jet 
Mrs. Agnew know who you 
were." 

"I blankly thought the meet¬ 
ing went pretty well." 

"Well, you can say what 
you want to, but I'm not going 
to attend another one of thtxa 
‘ brtng-your-wlfe4o4he-cabinet 
meeting* sessions until I'oi 
assured you will ask for the 
floor.” 

“To do what?” 

"To ask the pr^ident for g 
fresh jdteher of water, K 
nothing else.” 


WASHINGTON — The idea 
of having cabinet wives attend 
President N i x o n 'a cabinet 
meetings may have several 
virtues, but It also has its 
drawbacks. Even if nothing 
happened at the meetings, I 
would still bate to be a 
cabinet officer when I got 
hesne toat night. 

"Well," the cabinet officer's 
wife says, "you hardly op^ed 
your trap during toe entire 
meeting.” 

"But, dear, the president 
didn't call on me.” 


"You could have said some¬ 
thing about inflation." 

"I conld have said aome- 
thing about toe ABM or the 
Middle Etut or the poverty 
program. But what good 
would it have done?"

"I would have, if I had 
found out what you did. As far 
as I could tell, the only 
contribution you made to toe 
cabinet meeting was to spill a 
pitcher of water when the 
secretary of the treasury gave 
his report.” 

"Dearest, it was an ac¬ 
cident. Bob Finch spilled his 
water and you didn't see Mrs. 
Finch get mad.” 

“I o^y got mad when I 
realized tiiat no cme had even 
notices you did it That's how 
much attention they were 
paying to you.” 


"And Why. may I ask. didn't 
the president <^i on you? 
Your department is as im¬ 
portant as anybody eise’s. I 
Was to embarrasaed with you

"It so happens that some 
days I do all the talking. 
Unfortunately, you were there 
on the wrong day.” 

"A likely story. I’m not sure 
the presidntt even knows 
what you do. Tlie least he 
could have done is let you 
read a report or something. If 
you don’t have any pride, I

understand In this grim drama of sex and sadism behind "the

especially in the finale, where the three rebel schorjlboys gun 
down the m:»stcrR and the parents flc* for their lives. Of 
course, there is the usual quota of nudity In fact, for the 
first time in a film thal I have seen, there were dozens of 
young men wandering anxind (in the shower mom) front 
view and completely naked. After the first stare of disbelief, 
I accepted it a-s part of the action. I wasn't horrified, 
tittilated or shocked—i was entertained.

ny DOM GAIN 

The Tower of London has 
its ravens and Gityrattar has 
its apes. The <dd Union Club 
of Victoria had its rats. 

The rat stories aren't trWd 
often these days but. back 
M'hen -the club was on Douglas 
Street at Courtney, the rats 
were a problem aa weii as 
game for sport. 

The stories may be recalled 
Monday night when the dub 
holds its 90th anniversary 
dinner. 

Ral Hunts HelH 

B.C. hish>rian Bruce McKel* 
vie recalled one 2S years ago 
in « newspaper article. He told 
of the r|^t hunts at the old club, 
later to be operated by the 
Navy League during the 
Sec(md Worid War as Wnce 
Robert House, a servicemm's 
centre. 

There was a livery stable 
near the chib and It woa 
Mamed for the nightly inva* 
Sion of rats. Ihey had chewed 
two holes in the kitchen wall 
near the sink. 

The young members of the 
cipb would arrange for hie 
houseboy to plug up one of the 
holes early in the evening. 

Later at night they would go 
to the kitchen, after their 
poker game, and one man 


would enter and ^am a biscuit 
tin into the other hole before 
the lights were turned on. 

The ratebatohers, armed 
with walking etlcka, would 
then nish Into the kitchen, 
nooding it with light and 
putting the quietus on the 
rodents. 

Mrs Bet 

According to Mr. McKelvie, 
the hunt continued, on one 
occasion at least after the 
olub had moved to its present 
quarters In 1913, He told ot 
Conservative MP Harry 
Pooley betting a ten-spot tiiat 
he could go over to the old 
clubhouse, catch one or two 
rats, and be back in 15 
minutes. He was beck in 13 
minutes with three. 

■niere have been many 
anecdotes connected with the 
chib since it wu fonned “on 
a day in the month of April, 
1819,’’ as a former lieutenant- 
governor, Sir Frank Barnard, 
reported in a short history ot 
the club in 1929. 

/Vo Weaklings 

In January. 1908, some 
members petitioned to have 
the heat turned on in the 
radiators. Apparently this had 
never been done before. 

The present secretary, P. L. 


Bisiley, wrote In a history of 
the club in 1956 that the 
committee didn't take long to 
decide not to show mercy, for 
the members should realize 
the club was no place for 
weaklings. 

The club began on that 
April day, apparently of un¬ 
certain date, 90 years ago in a 
room over Van Volkenburg's 
butcher shop in the building at 
Yates and Government, later 
occupied by the Poodle Dog 
restaurant. The premises had 
just been vacated by the B.C. 
Mining Stock Exchange and 
became the first home ot the 
club's members. 

The quarters weren't large, 
but neither was Victoria. At 
that time there were about 
1,000 people and some 60 
saloons. The city’s representa¬ 
tives in Ottawa were Pilme 
Minister Sir John A. Mac¬ 
donald and Amor De Cptmos. 

First President 

First president of the club 
was Sir Matthew BailUe Bcg- 
bie. 

By 1884 the club was too 
small for its membership and 
land was bought on Douglas 
at Courtney tor a new club- 
hfxise. A three-storey Vic- 
torian-ityle brick building was 


erected which survived until 
after the Second World War. 

But by 1913 the club had 
built and moved into its 
present quarters on Gordon at 
Humboldt. It was designed by 
Loring Rexford of San Fran¬ 
cisco and built by .Sound 
Engineering and Construction 
Co. of Seattle, both awards 
having „ been made on a 
competitive basis. 

Many Changes 

There haven’t been any 
reports of rats in the present 
luxurious quarters of the club, 
which have been renovated 
and enlarged over the years. 

But therft have been 
changes, such as the admis¬ 
sion of women into certain 
rooms of the club. They may 
belong, with their husbands, 
and may continue their mem¬ 
bership after their husbands 
die. But tiiey can't join as 
individuals. 

/Voted Visitors 

The club that started out, 
even before it was organized, 
with a few friends meeting lor 
a billard game in a hall over 
Morrison's Drug Store on the 
northeast corner of Fort and 
Government, eventually oame 
to c mertain distinguished 


visitors from all o\’er the 
world. 

There aren't too many 
members left who can 
remember the old days. One 
of them is John Hugill, former 
attorney-general of Alberta, a 
member since 1911. who was 
bom just two years after the 
club was fonned. Now. in his 
retirement, he is a resident 
member of the club. 


Still Poor 

A Brentwood man Involved io 
a motorcycle accident April 10 
was still unconscious and in poor 
condition enriy this morning in 
Royal Jubilee Hospital. 

Alan Chadwick, 35. of 1049 
Clark, suffered a fractured skull 
when the cycle he was driving 
left the West Saanich Rood at 
Vender and collided with a util- 
, ity pole.

By BILL STAVDAL 

Fine arts students at the 
University of Victoria Satur¬ 
day asked Professor Peter 
Kahn to reconsider his resig¬ 
nation. 

They also urged the univer¬ 
sity administration to remove 
Dr. Alan Gowans from "any 
d e e 1 s i(H]-making position’’ 
affecting the studio visual arts 
department. 

A mass meeting of the 
students followed disclosure 
Friday of a split In the 
faculty. It is based mainly on 
differences between Dean 
Peter Garvle and Dr. Alan 
Gowans on one side, and some 
faculty and students an the 
other. 

★ ★ ★ 

Prof. Kahn, a graphic arts 
specialist who came here 
from Cornell University last 
fall, submitted his resignation 
Thursday. 

Dr. Gerald Hendrie, head of 
music since he came here in 
1961, resigned earlier this 
year but has said he would 
leave two months earlier than 
scheduled because of “intoler¬ 
able” pressure. 

At the centre of the Issue Is 
the faculty’s search for a 
head of the studio visual arts 
department. 

* * « 

Dissident students have 
charged Prof. Garvie and Dr. 
Gowans have ignored faculty 
recommendations, and the 
department is being turned 
into “industrial arts school.” 

Dr. Gowans has been head 
of the art history department 
since the fine arts school was 
established in 1966. 

Saturday's meeting of art 
students drew about GO of the 
80 students in the studio 
visual arts program, said 
student spokesman Lawrence 
Pope, 22. 


The meeting approved a 
lengthy resolution which said 
in part: 

“The entire university is 
based on respect for profes¬ 
sionalism, which In this ease 


has been negated by the 
acceptance by the head of the 
school ot fine arts. Prof. 
Garvie. of Dr. Gowans’ (act¬ 
ing) chairmanship of the 
division of studio visual arts, 
thoug^i the latter Is not a 


p r a e Using, accredited or 
d e m o n s t rably competent 
member of the active or 
professional a r 11 a ti e com¬ 
munity of either Victoria or 
the University of Victoria.” 

The students unanimbusly 


requested Prof. Kahn to with¬ 
draw his resignatiim and act 
as chairman of the division of 
studio visual arts “until a 
satlsf&etory future for the 
division, and the acboed. Is 
assured.”

figures <» the amount collected so far were available, said 
Mrs- Nickels. 

"Offldaily, we are still somewhere in the S6,000 range, 
but once the girls report in, this figure will go up drastically. 1 
■>hope to be able to give a pretty close result on Monday.” 


ncgpoirfe to the canvass, she said, had been great. Moot 
people Nvere expecting the canvassers end few had turned 
them away. 

Planned bs a cne-night blitz, the drive had to be spread 
nver more than a week because of the lack ot volunteers, she 
said. 

“That meaite we just have to work a little harder, and we 
won't quit until the whole city has been covered.” 

# This year’s objective was $35,000 to cover part of the 
Solarium's maintenance cost which amounted to more than 
$300,000 a year, she said.

(UPI) — Mrs. Harry Rey¬

feeling "Just fine" Saturday, 
Just two days after she 
delivered her fifth child at

'T Just got tired of seeing 
hospital rates go up every 
time you turn around," she 
said. 

Mrs. Reynolds, whose fourth 
child came at a hospital-

had read books on baby care. 

'"There were Instructions on 
what do do in case you had 
your baby at home." she said. 
"It's really not that hard. I 
had no trouble at all." 

Her husband, a logger, was 
at work when the event 
occurred. Her four other 
children were watching tele-

NEW DELHI (UPD— 
Drought conditions in South 
India have made water so 
scarce that railway com¬

keeping their team ruming. 
All trains run on steam and 
large quantities of water are 
needed for their operation. 


"My husband was happy 
with the result when he came 
home, but he thinks I’m a nut 
for not going to the hospital,” 
Mrs. FteyiMlds said. "But I'm 
one of t^se harddieaded kind 
and when I decide to 
something, I do It." 

The "result" was a boy

1/.S. Anti’Semitism 


Menace to Nation 




WASHINGTON (AP)-Active 
anti-Semitism is limited in the 
U.S. but widespread Indlffereoce 
makes it a potential majw 
menace to the nation, a team| 
of researcheni reported Satur¬ 
day. 

It_taid widely-held prejudice 
against Jews, as oiq;>osed to 
overt hostility, is "firmly an¬ 
chored in a whole system ^ 
generally unenlightened beliefs, 
and weak cmnmitment to de¬ 
mocracy."

The ctudy was c<xviucted by 
the University of California 
under a grant from the Anti- ' 
Defamation League of B'nai 
B'rith, a Jewish service or¬ 
ganization. 

Generally, preju<kce was found 
1 o be less among the better- 
educated in the population al¬ 
though heavy support of social 
club discrimination was foiand 
among college graduates with 
high income and occupatiimal 
status. In contrast with some 
views, over-aii anti-Semitism 
among Negroes was found to be 
less than that among whitei.

Cape lASB power squadron 
members have warned that 
unless improvement of dock¬ 
ing facilities (or small boats 
at fomox is undertaken soon, 
boat owners will take their 
bu!tineas to other areas. . 

Lack of a proper break¬ 
water and shifting sand in the 
bay make Comox a poor spot 
for visiting boaters, the Cape 
Laza Power Squadron said at 
its annual me^ng last week. 

Following a meeting in 
Ottawa, Mayor R. O. Ellis 
recently reported plana are 
underway for reconstruction 
of the present wharf to provide 
protection for small boats 
moored at King Salmon Club

Fiji the Prize As Fisherman King Agi 


But you have to be a 
subkeriber to get in on the 
major prizes like the vacation 
in Fiji and the aluminum ‘Cartop 
boat. 

Bill and Elteen Stephenson, 
307 Cadillac, know the value of 
being Colonist sutMcribers dur* 
ing the fishing season. 

Last year Bill entered a 6.12- 
pound spring (chinoc^) salmon 
he caught at Pedder Bay and 


that (ish was drawn as the big 
hidden winner of a Canadian 
Pacific Airlines trip for two to 
Hcfwali. '' 

They take off in a luxury 
Canadian Pacific jet airliner 
May 8 and will tour the 
Hawaiian Islands until May 16. 

They will be guests of Shera- 
ton4Iawaii and the Inter-Islands 
Resorts during their holiday 
trip. 


of other prizes, trophies and 
Prince Buttons for both monthly 
and contest-long competition. 


They will stay at the Royal 
Hawaiian in Honolulu May 9 
through May 13. the Naniloa in 
Hilo May 14, Kona Inn May 15 
and Princess Kailulani May 16. 


The 1969 edition of The Daily 
Colonist King Fisherman Con¬ 
test is about to start, and the 
big prize is a trip to the South 
Pacific. 

TTw contest starts Saturday 
and will eemtinue for six 
months, ending Oct. 36, and the 
main hidden weight prize this 
year will be a Canadian Pacific 
Airilnei trip fta two to Fiji. 

There wll] be a grand array 


be time for all Vancouver 
Island anglers to make sure 
they are Colonist subscribers. 
Then all they have to do is 
catch a five pound salmon or a 
one pound trout or bass to win a 
chance cm the Fiji trip. 

The more fish entered, the 
more chances in the big turret

VICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA, SUNDAY, APRIL 20, 1969 


Youth Probe 


Mafia Talk Sparking Jay> 


“We are being infiltrated by 
persixis from Vancouver and 
Victoria. But this word 'Mafia' 
is a rather large and frightening 
word t» use. 

“I don't think there is any 
ostablisibed, organized group 
working in the area, but there 
are these persons who contri¬ 
bute nothing to society, who 
move into areas and bring their 
drug habits with them. They 
form the nucleus ot a drug 
using group and they in turn 
start distributing drugs to other 
people." 


lions of dollars a year out of 
the drug market on this con¬ 
tinent. Within the past month, 
there has been a quantity of 
Mafia-sold LSD, cut udth 
strychi^ne, available in this 
area." 

He said he was against having 
Mafia-supplied drugs rea<Kly 
available to CAY members and 
that he would be one of those 
who would try to keep the 
pushers from joperating within 
the committee. 

Mr. La Lain's charges of 
Mafia operatidns In Nanaimo 
were dismissed by RCMP and 
Mayor Frank Ney In interviews 
Saturday. 

RCMP Staff Sgt. Gib Perry 
said he did not believe there 
H’as an organized crime operat¬ 
ing in the Nanaimo area. 


“Ehnjgs or marijuana have 
been getting here through unor¬ 
ganized routes but in a month 
or two this problem will be 
completely taken care of. The 
problem is one right across the 
country. We’ve all had to adjust 
ourselves to fight It. 

Mr. Moi^gan said that Mr. La 
Lain did not really represent 
the youth committee. 


leased to the committee by 
Nanaimo city council. 

Mr. La Lain was taken to the 
Jaycee meeting by Jim Morgan 
chairman of tiie youth commit¬ 
tee. He was introduced as an 
advisor to the committee. 

Jaycee vice-pre.sident Bill 
House said Saturday that Mr. 
La Lain’s comments threw a 
different light on previous sup¬ 
port given to the committee by 
the Jaycecs. 

“The Jaycee executive will 
strike a committee to seriously 
investigate the mechanics of the 
CAY. We still feel their intent is 
good, but the young people 
could be swayed violently by 
someone such as Mr. La Lain. 
Look what happened Thursday 
night. 

“He came to us supposedly to 


talk about CAY, and he swung 
to drugs. He took alt 2ft of us 
witn him,” Mr. House said’ 

He said the fact that Mr. 
Morgan introduced Mr. Li^Lain 
as an advisor was, in fact, an 
appointment from the chair, if 
not by the group. The only way 
Mr. La Lain's comments could 
be dissociated from the ..com¬ 
mittee, would be for a public 
statement of dissociation from 
the group. 

After the Jaycee meeting, 
Charles Kruse, corresponding 
secretary for the youth com¬ 
mittee. resigned his position. He 
said the reason was partly 
because he fcld the group was 
being'iilfiltratod by people who 
did not have concern for the 
young people the committee 
originally hoped to help. 


He said the committee's 
statements and actions “do not 
reflect what I believe and can 
stand up for in good con¬ 
science." 

During his talk Mr. La Lain 
said he had been taking drugs 
for 10 years and felt the 
problem was not in taking the 
drugs but the reason for taking 
them. 


By ARNOLD OLAON 

NANAIMO — Nanaimo Junior 
Oiamber of Commerce is to 
investigate the city's recently 
formed Committee for the 
Advancement of Youth after 
hearing a talk by a former 
Simon Fraser, student who 
claimed the Mafia was operat¬ 
ing in Nanaimo and described 
drug-taking by young people. 

The ex-stident, Michel La 
Lain, said the recently closed 
Third Kye coffee shop in 
Nanaimo had been a place for a 
group older than the 15 to 21 
range, catered to 1^ the com¬ 
mittee. 

Mr. La Lain said the result 
would be that those people 
would gravitate tix^ard the 
committee centre in the old 
Nanaimo lire hall, recently 


“His views are going to be 
discussed by the CAY board and 
we will make a public state¬ 
ment about the matter," he 
continued. 

"As for myself, the whole 
thing is my fault. The impres¬ 
sion was given that his state¬ 
ments were CAY’s and this isn’t 
true. 


He maintained that if drugs 
were used in helping to gain 
insight, instead of for the thrills, 
taking them could be beneficial. 

He said that society was 
forcing people to buy drugs such 
as LSD from the Mafia. 

"Contrary to what the police 
say. the Mafia docs exist in 
Nanaimo. They're 


Mayor Ney said he had been 
working with police and com¬ 
munity leaders to fight drug use 
In Nanaimo. 

“The Mafia has not been 
operating in this area," he said.

R.C Tel crewi have started 
t>lacing almost two miles of 
undorgniund and aerial cable 
towards the northeast of Port 
Alberni. L. A. Huxtable. di-s- 
' trict manager, said the 
project, costing over $58,000 
will provide facilities north of 
Rfigers Creek for a new 
subdivision in the area for the 
next five years. 

In Nanaimo, crews last 
week started pulling in Iti 
miles of cable in underground 
conduit from the main office 
on FitzWilliam to Townside

modation. 

No applications have been 
received for the boarding 
accommodation yet largely be¬ 
cause no schedule of fees has 
been set up, the society's letter 
said. 

Council members agreed 
some docisiun should be made 
on the matter at a.s early a date 
as posfflble, but that the sub¬ 
stantial sum-involved requires 
adequate consideration. Council 
is awaiting replies from oper¬

Unless the regional board

"an awful loMPnissappolnled

"We’ve got the staff, we’ve

Housinii Proiect Launched at Last 


Everybody Delighted 


Victoria Mayor Hugh 
Stephen said Friday that he 
was delighted that Transport 
Minister Paul Hellyer had 
cleared the way for low-rental 
housing in the Rose-BIanshard 
urban development site. 

He added that he under¬ 
stood that work would begin 
at once on the $2,400,000 
project and that Victoria 
contractor George Wheaton 
would s^brt the job in a 
matter o(,d^s. 

His statement followed an 
announcement Friday morn¬ 


ing in Vancouver that Mr. 
HeUyer had signed the neces¬ 
sary documents to make 
possible the building of 184 
housing units in the city's 
urban renewai area. 

♦ A ★ 

It was anticipated Friday at 
City Hall that the official 
contract fonns would be re¬ 
ceived here early next week. 

The mayor said he was 
grateful to Mr. Wheaton for 
tolerating the delay in ratifi¬ 
cation of the contract and that 
he hoped there would be no 
more hitches. 


He was also grateful, he 
said, to Victoria MP Itavld 
Groos, for the work he had 
done in expediting the whole 
matter, 

"! had all along assumed 
that this could only be a 
temporary bitch. It was in¬ 
conceivable that once the 
facts were known the minister 
would not sign the documents 
and allow the work to pro¬ 
ceed.” the mayor said. 

City Manager Dennis Young 
added that he was happy that 
the whole matter had been 
straightened out satisfactorily. 


He also believed all along, he 
said, that once the facts were 
krtown, the necMeary ratifica¬ 
tion would be given. 

Mr. Hellyer's final approval 
followed two days of confusion 
which had city officials 
worried that the development 
might be held up indefinitely. 

* A ★ 

The problem arose because 
Victoria authorities didn't ac¬ 
cept the lowest tender for the 
project last year, and Mr. 
HeUyer said (hat under CMHC 
regulations, the lowest bidder 
was to get the contract.

it takes to go the long way round when the tide

This would have allowed the Oak Bay Little

iDoing in India 


Picture yourself m your local 
supermarket^ please. 

You pick up half a dosen toma¬ 
toes and take them to thejgirl at the 
cash re gister. She looks at yout 
looks at the tomatoes and says» 
**Forty cents a pound.’* % 

**Ouirageousr* you shoui. 
'^Thief! BandUt FB give you 25 
cents a pound and not a penny 
mare.^^ ^ 

**You can have them for 35 a 
pound,** she says. 

**Thirty,** you say. 

**Done,** she replies and puts 
them into a hag. 

It probably didn't go like dtat the last time you 
went shotting, but that’s the way it aeaNy 
always is in India. Buying things—anything fnnn 
potatoes to peazte— is a game, and it is a lot 
cheaper If you play weB. Unforhmatdy, I don’t. 

I am the Joe BtsOt ol hagglers; even «4>en I 
frin 1 lose. 

Let me give you an example. 

There is a tailor 1 patronize, a TSahuus, 
brilliant, grey-bearded old bandit ’■tiD ought to be 
either oa Carnal^ Street or DevB's Island. 

"You like me thb piecet" be aifes every hme 
be cesnes into the house, and bolds out the ^eee 
of pink-and-green tartan teryiene he has been 
tryir^ to sell me for tbe last If months. 

"No, I don't I think ifs shastiy." I amy. 

"Yes, yes," be agrees, for be Is an agreeable 
man exc^t when it comes to prices, "very nice. 
You like me?" 

On the occasku of my wont defeat we were 
negotiating about a suit. I had determined not to 
pay more than 125 rupees for tailoring. 

"Ifow much is this going to cost?" I asked 
iMlIigerently, showing the doth as he earoe 
dirough the door. 

"Oh yes. very nice," be said, fbelbig tbe doth 
adnuringiy. "Very nice." 

Then he took out his tape measure and drew 
It across my sboidders. 

"How much?" I said again, reidizing he was 
aeizing the initiative. 

"Hmmrn," be mumbled and wrote in Ms book 
in Urdu. 

"How much?" X tried .again. "1 wiH give only 
125 rupees. Only." I knew I <was in trouble. 

He was measuring the inside seam now and 
murmuring reassuringly, "Yes, yes, ^oh, very 
nice." finally he finished and made tfie last entry 


In his book; he had filled neariy a page wlfii 
measurements. 

"Yes, ISO ngwes," be said, straightening up. 

"What! Hohbery!" I cried. TUdiculoua! I wiS 
go to anodKr taikir. I can get it for 100 rupees in 
the bazaar!'’ 

good. I wtHking only 


sntD ttie fool of some unsuspecting foreigner, and 
if he is slow in withdranring his foot, his slKelaces 
are whipped out and broken before his eyes. "No 
good. Meakbig," gw shoe-shine boy explains as 

he throws gKm awuy./ 

With no shoelaceB, the tourist is almost f<Meed 
to stand slBI wfeSe his shoes are shined 
(extremely wrii), and new laces put in. Then 
semes tbe nto, 

"Ten rupees." gte Okoe shiner says, miara 
dbout 11.40.) 

What happens tiMn depends on the tourist, buf 
(be shoe riunnr has lots of time, and it’s rarely, I 
think, that be comes away with less than a rupee, 
iridch is Mwut four times the going rate. And. df

plaiie. be may hand over a 10-rupee note—three 
dagn’ wages tor a laborer. 

However, if you Ifre haggling, trips to the 
baaaar can be fun and r e w a rding. India is one of 
toe last places in the world, I suspect, where 
jeweBers stH make jewriry (when was the last 
tone you saw a jeweller on Douglas Street 
hasnsnering out a sflver earring?), tailors stffl 
tailor, and shoem^ers still make shoes. Indeed, 
when was the last time your milkman brought the 
earn to yow frent door wd milked It? Many 
todian imlkmen do it that way; it saves bottling 
and delivery—if you’re a amall boy, you ride tbe 
cew between bouses. ^ 

Not aD foreigners, of course, like to squeeze 
between cews and csamels down crowded, GmeQy 
bazaar streets, so to help them part with their 
Iveign currency, many Indian handicraft mer¬ 
chants go door to door. 

The best-known of these eastern Fuller 
Brashnrwn come from toe mountain state of 
Kastanur. In the winter they migrate south like 
geese or locusts; they always find the foreignois 
to toe towns they visit 

Once to your Vving room a Kashmlrf 
salesman is more poweiful Hian a locomotive and 
tatos faster than a speeding bullet. I'\’e never met 
auiyhody who let a Kashmiri salesman in the 
bouse and got him out again without buying 
amnething. Indeed, some foreigners' houses would 
warn tbe heart of an aid Kashmiri mother, for 
they are Mt by Kasfasniri lamps, carpeted with 
Kashmiri carpets and furnished with Kashmiri 
tables and (hairs. These houses are more 
Katotniri than Kashmir. 

(For myself, knowing my weakness, Tve 
never let a Kashndri salesman in the door, but 
Fve watched him to other people's houses. Aa a 
nsult. I own no Indian handicrafts, not even that 


"Bazaar tailcw

to it: "Ota yes, yes, very toee." 

Then he kulred at me again, "doth not 
enough. One-quarter metre short. Give me IS

My early training in front of casta regbters in 
Victoria supermarkets was my undoing. Beftee 1 
could think, I had responded to this reasonable 
request 1^ handing over another IS rupees. 
Mumniring, "Yes. oh yes, very nice," he 
retreated Into the night. * 

After he had gone, raucoos lau^ter came 
from the next room where my friends had been

need anotoer quarter-metre of cloth at all and 
that he had, in fact, succeeded in raising bis 
original price by five rupees. There was nothing 
left to do but cry myself to sleep. 

But toere Is no point in crying over spilt

battles.

In Connaught CSrele, the (wntre of New Delhi,

No. 2 PREDATOR 

BEHIND EVERY BAD DOG IS A WORSE OWNER 


By CONSERVATION OFFICER JAMES OSMAN 


Conservation - minded 
people will remember the 
winter of 1968-69 as one 
of the hardest we have 
had for a long time on all 
wild animals, especially 
deer. These losses were 
caused mostly by starva^ 
tion and to a lesser degree 
by predators. Of the first 
there is little we can do, as 
tve have no control over 
nature. Snow and cold 
killed hundreds of deer 
and those that were weak’- 
ened became easy prey of 
any other animal that 
wanted to kill them. 

This brings u[> the question of 
who these animals are. Man himself 
is the worst predator, and by man 1 
mean the white man. 

We cannot include the Indian as 
be, in nearly all cases, Idlia only for 
what he wants to eat. True, he may 
step over the line of the white man's 
laws, but not very often. 

Unlike his white brother, he does 
sot shoot such things as bhie bills, 
mergansers, grebes, and other 
harmless and unedible ducks just to 
see them fall out of the air. 

He may not have much of ' an 
education but he can tell a swan 
from a goose. 

Neither do we find him at 3 
In the morning on some lonely 
logging road with a spotlight and a 
rifle, conveniently unloaded and in 
the back seat when the conservatioo 
officer finally gets him stopped, 
kM^ing, be says, for a place to 
camp. 

He does not kiU kelt steelbead. 
Mack as a gumboot and just tdxKit 
as good to eat, for the glory M 
taking a prize in a fishing derby- 

You see 1 am a conservation 
officer and having been on the job 
for 30 years 1 have a s<KnewhaC 
jaundiced view of some of our so- 
called "sportsmen.” 

So much for ttie human race. 
How abcMjt wolf, cougar, bears and 
others that share the woods with the 
deer? 

Ihe Vancouver Island wolf is 
MxMit gone, and as usual, too late, 
protected. 

Next we have the cougar or 
mouiitain lion, called a bloodthirsty 
IdBer by a good many armchair 
hunters who call for his extermina* 
tion. Surprising some sp(H'tsman'i 
clubs who should know better, agree 
with him. Actually he does more 
good than harm by thinning out the 
deer on over^pulated ranges, and 
removing the weaker animals. He 
i^ly what be wants for food, 
and will consume a whMe deer 
unless it goes bad in the warm 
weather before moving on to some¬ 
thing else that might be a grouse, 
ooon or anything he can catch. I 
have caused the demise of' a few 


few other wild animals we have to 
contend with. The black bear will 
eat anything he can catch, but he 
has poor eyesight and cannot run 
down a deer, and unless he falls 
over a fawn he will not locate it as 
they have no scent. 

So we come to the mirst killer of 
them all, the number two predator, 
the domestic dog. Dogs, most of 
them non-feral, kill hundreds of deer 
every year. With the aid of a little 
snow an Alsation or police dog can 
run down any deer he takes after 
and a good many when the deer are 
weak in the spring. 

To date, this winter in the 
Courtenay-Comox area, dogs nearly 
ail police dogs, have killed IS deer 
and one trumpeter swan. There are 
a good many more that I do not 
know about. 

Very seldom are the dogs seen by 
the conservation officer or an RCMP 
officer who arrives on the scene and 
finds nothing but dead or dying deer. 

Deer will run for the water us 
soon as they hear a dog and will try 
to escape by swimming away. I 
have seen deer strike out for the 
open sea and never come back. 


cougars, hundreds that Is. and as I 
loMc back I do not think I did 
anything to help good game 
management. We can deduct the 
very few who destroyed domestic 
stock. 

ITie fish and wildlife branch long 
ago stopped paying bounties for the 
sport of a few men with cougar 
dogs. No longer do we pay some 
so-called "bonus hunter" $200 for 
shooting a mother cougar, digging 
her four cubs out htm under a 
cedar root, and hitting them over the 
head. Cougar are very easy to 
control with hounds and a fresh 
track is usually a dead cat. 

The cougar is nearing the end of 
his rope. As the big trees go he has 
to come nearer to human habitation 
during the winter and his hunting 
grounds are more easily reached. He 
could hold his own with the man 
afoot or on snowshoes but he cannot 
cope with the four-wheeled-drive 
vehicle or the motor toboggan. 
Where once the baying of die trail 
hounds struck terror into his heart it 
is now probably the whine of the 
skidoo. 

On Vancouver Island there are 


Jl.M OS.tiAJS 
beblod the eight ball. 


Even if they come out of the water 
diey get pneumonia and arc dead 
within twu hours. I have rubbed 
down dozens of them and put them 
behind my furnace, but base never 
seen one li%'e. 

Ircaiically, the most friendly dog 
can transform into a deadly killer a* 
soon as he gets the scent o( a deer. 

Last winter 1 followed a policn 
dog. fresh from the deer he had 
killed, into his owner's back yard. 
The owner firmly denied his dog 
would kill a deer until I sliowed him 
the blood on the dog. He had\inly 
been away from home for a little 
over an hour. But a dog can go a 
long way in that time. 

Another time 1 surprised a police 
deg on a deer he had just killed and 
as I looked througi) the telesci^io 
sight I could see he had a collar and 
a licence. As 90 per cent of dogs in 
rural - areas are n.>t licensed, I 
decided the owner must think well of 
his dog and did not shout it. There 
was a tittle snow on the ground and 
much to my advantage the dog had 
a small cut on his foot that showed 
up well in the snow. 

The dog ran and I took after him. 
He knew I was after him and knew 
he had done wrong. He circled and 
tried every trick of the trade, but 
three hours after 1 followed his 
tracks for five miles right into the 
city of Courtenay and info the 
owner's yard. The old boy was 
behind the stove drying off and he 
sure was glad to see me. Climbed 
all over me like a long-lost friend. It 
was hard to believe it was the same 
dog but his cut foot gave him away. 
Even the owner refused to believe 
old Rex would do such a tiling, so 1 
took his teen-age son and back* 
tracked to the dead deer. 

A dog is m.-tn*.s -best friend, he 
will stay with you tlirough thick and 
thin and all he asks is a square 
shake. Look after your dog and don't 
collect a menagerie of gcx>d-for» 
nothing mongrels. If you don't want 
him try to find a good home for him 
and failif^ th.it have him humanely 
disposed of. Din't take him 20 miles 
out in the bush and kick him out the 
car door. He has to live and if no 
6ne feeds hirA he will try to catch 
deer to eat and don’t forget one bad 
dog can make deer runners out of a 
half a dozen good d-^s. 

* Ibe conservatirxi officer is behind 
the eight bail. He can only warn the 
owners of dogs that they can he shot 
if they are found running deer, but it 
is not the answer. Behind every bad 
dog is a worse owner. 

So If you are of those earthy 
peoMe w'ho get up early in the 
morning and hear the excited 
barking of d<igs in the woods. look at 
your neighbor’s doorstep. It may be 
his dog running doer, or whisper it •. 
aoftly, it may be your own.

Victorians. 

AJas historians have overlooked the ilhis- 
trious roles played by these unusual pioneers: br 
••rogues and vagabonds," as the courts termed 
•me of them so long ago. 

The first name to appear in our ghllery <*f 
cibaracters is that of John Costello, hnsh 
boatman. Ah Victoria knew this delightfui 
oiariner. affectionately calling him "Biny dte 
Bug." A love of Iktuid refreshment and a good 
twawl were the sins which earned the former 
blat^smith and diver several ap^tearances before 
■a magistrate. BiDy's side-line of running eloping 
^tuples and Royal Navy deserters to the 
American side also inspired hot words on more 
than one occasion. 

It was an argument over the misappropria¬ 
tion of a fnend's pump which led to his first 
conviction of assault. Billy's temper had passed 
■a suddenly as it descended, for he had

When both anieared before the magistrate 
two days later, poor Billy was in the role of

This must be one of the rare instances on 
record when Sir James lost the last word! 

The “occasionally oblivious” colonel then 
announced to a somewhat less than joyous city he 
would favor it with his company fM* several 
months to “prove his disregard for His 
Excellency's mandate.” 

Next on our list is one of the more tragic 
figures, “Scotty.” 

“Yesterday morning.” reported !%« Coloaist, 
Dec. 29. 1860. "poor 'Scotty,' the lunato^ confined 
in jaB on a charge of vagrancy, became tired of 
snuffing the free air of Britain through the bars 
ot a cell; and determined to enjoy the same 
among the bars at Esqutmalt. S>. yesterday 
maming. when the jailor's'back was h*med. be 
passed through one of the gates and made off. He 
was folhtwed. and late in the sftem-vtn was 
aaitght in Esquimalt. 

“When found, he was aAerina to enli<it in Her 
l&jesty's service on board Ibe Topa7.. as an able 
bodied seaman. He was marched ba''k to his oAd 
quarters, and will be more closely watched in the 
future.” 

Months before, be bad made n«ws by 
perambulating Victoria streets, “reciting ha 
tesane gibberish to al wbo wilt lend an eftr”; 
citizens had bemoaned the colBay's laHr of proper 
faculties for »ich u Scotty. 

After his abated attempt to Join the navy. 
Scotty ompleted his senlewee. Released on the 
morning of Jan. 35, 1861. be wss “dcfaik as a 
bed” by nightfaB. 

Ten days later, he was in cufit'vtv ag;*in for 
**taking possession” of a store, eamivg a month 
In company of the Qlustriaus Jotwi Thif»» on 9ie 
chain gang. 

At liberty all of three days, on Mu' G Scotty 
became annoyed at an Indiaa at tho corner ot 
Yates and G<H-ernmeot. Loaing his temper, the 
rascal threw several stones at his antagnoist't 
head. Sediy bis aim was none too true — one 
missile found. Its way tlwough the windnsr of 
Zdner’s drug stMe some bottles, 

damages totalled SSO and Scotty rehimed to hia 
'acB. 

Two weeks later, having again tired of Ms 
ipartan quarters, Sbotty propped a b'l.'ird oeatost 
the jaflyard fence. He was haMway up when a 
goard seized his coattails, and hairi'^l him bach. 
Be was reMeved of sawing wood in the vsrd. 

But. less than a month later he had 
redeemed himself to the e xt ent guards made him 
m “tnisty”; and act which they came to regret 
March 18. vhei Scotty was “sent tor a Iwcket of 
water while the remainder of the R?ne was 
oecupted in breaking stone near the church 
reserve. 

“Not reluming, after the lapse of Sf»me little 
thne, an was soot to look for him. 'Hien it 

was found that the had taken 8(toan^'*ge of the 
confidence reposed in hkn and d.'tt'wr«wed. Ete 
sms seen in the course cf the af'i^rnoio at 
Esquimalt. where he offered himself as an able 
bodied seaman on hoard one of Her Majesty’s 
Later in the evenkig. he mide his 
■IgKarance near special officer McGee's house 
at the head of Pandexa Street, and was chased 
toto the bushes 1^ that officer, where he was lost 
algbt of.” 

Recaptured a week later. Scatty w.^s reported 
•knuch refreshed by the brief smift of the free air 

Britain, and is to good conditioa for hard 
WDCfc.” 


Finally Scot^ roamed mekuria alr ee U m 
more, loading hkn aboard a ahipi Victoria 
officials washed Aelr hands cd the baplea 
wretch; he was last reported to San FraneiacOi 
■enteskced to the dwin gang for vagrancy. 

There were offirrs in aeed of treatment wha 
received only laughter and acorn. Such aa 
MarcheQe, the “crazy Fren ch man.” who perched 
atop a hi^ rock overlooking the hartiar with only 
acme blankets and apples. Arresting officers 
found $47 and a- knife in his possession. 

Then there was James "Pat” Wright, brish 
impostor. One day in 1963, slightly the anrse for 
wear, Pat stumbled into a ravine. Rushed to 
hospital, the ailing character was offered every 
attention until Dr. J. S. Helmcken could find no 
sign of injuries, “Inside or out.” Sgt. Hill 
promptly arrested him as “an idle, drunken, 
worthless character, who would not work, and has 
been several times before the magistrate.” 

Came Pat’s next appearance, the ailing sobld 
sobbed he could not walk, he would have to be 
carried into court. “At last, however, he entered 
from the jailyard completely doubled up and 
crippled from the effects of his injurie.s, and 
leaning his entire weight upon tbe arm of a 
paliceman.” 

Tenderly seated in the dock, the charge was 
read, and Pat asked if he had anything to say. 
Suddenly oblivious to his injuries, Pat stood bolt 
iqvight and “commenced to harangue the court, 
gradually waroDitog to the eloquence of a Curran 
(famous Irish statesman and orator). 

"He depicted in fluent language the variotia 
occupations in which he had been lately engaged 
and thnv said he had received severe spinal 
injuries by falling a height of thir-rty seven feet 
faito the ravine, but had been sadly neglected at 
the hospital; in foet the traiement was sich that 
he woiM rather die in the prison than have to 
submit to H again. 

” ‘The maoag;er has a spite against me. your 
bODor; I was there once before and he 
r^nembered me the moment be saw me.’ 
(Laughter). 


Shopping in India

greatest of artistie achievements—ttie plastic Taj 
Mahal that lights up in the dark.) 

It would be wrong, of course, to suggest that 
the Kashmiri salesman, or any Indian craftsman, 
doesn’t give value. By western standards, 
anything made by hand—whether you are gypped 
a little or not—to iDCiredibly cheap. 

For exangiie. k pair of hand-made shoes (and 
It - is a strange aensation to have sumeune 
measure both feet to half a dozen places) is Rs 
SS—about S. A two-trouser suit with waistcoat, 
including materito and tailoring-about $50, 
Carved tables, lacquer work, brass and jewelry 
fail in the same category. One friend bought a 
magnificent-looktng string of garnets tor Rs 
40-about S&.1S. 

Indeed, the things tha(. are expensive are 
factory products. Status lias in owning ready¬ 
made. eot)on4ery4ene shirts. A motor scooter is 
between Rs 3,000-4,000. mom than $400. And. of 
course, for the readymade products there is a 
fbced price and no haggling. 

I suppose, then, India is oo its way towards 
aupermackets and department stores. A few 
efforts in that direction are being made in the 
cities, but to me, brought up on Eaton's and The 
Bay, their carhexMopied bills and quaintly time- 
consuming cash and parcel windows seem strange 
and Charles Dfekens-y. 

No, for toe Mme being I guess Ill take my 
chances with the craftsmen—even if that old 
bandit of a tailor seUs me a green-and-ptok lartmi 
terylene shirt the next time be comes. 


** TF ye wll axe toe <ffieer who picked me ufi 
to come forward, he will tell ye that it aras cely 
by tbe mer cy of Pionderwe that 1 fd between 
tero of toe poata and aras not kilt outr^to I wan 
toatoaible far several boors unto I came to my 
ainaes.* (Laughter)-*’ 

When Sopt. Smith noted Pat had b e e n to eourf 
as often as toree tones a week, the outraged 
defradant be l low ed ; *nal: ra often as that, tha 
books will spake for themselves! 'There aras a 
dhninfcen man leO cf a bridge the otoer day at 
Nanainw and waa k3R: and because 1 came hern 
and am not dead, therefore 1 am not burr-t,” ha 
told the delighted galleries. 

The magistrate remanded him a day for 
medical examination, at which his infirmities 
“returned as quickly as they had vanished, and 
the p(4iceman’s support was necessary before thd 
prisoner would stir. Upon passing out someone 
gave him a slight impetus from behind, when the 
prisoner turr^ round and cast a look of 
indignation upon the aggressor, which ccmvulsed 
the whole court in laughter.” 

’They were still laughing the next day when 
Pat again faced the court, to say he had a job 
awaiting him at Port Ludlow. Asked if he would 
catch the next steamer to that port, he whined; 
“How can I. your honor? I may be a cripple for 
life, from the state of me back?" To which the 
magistrate replied .^'itb a sentence of two days. 
Delighted at his ligm punishment. Pat “made as 
. prtjfound a bow ... as bis infirmities would 
I admit of, and w-as removed with an evident leer 
I of salisfoctioa beaming in his haggard count- _ 
enance." 

“John Livermore for suppisong Ikju-ir to 
Indians,” was a common entry in the tetoce 
calendar a century ago. Know-n .as “Liverpool 
Jack,” this rapie created mosre than a little 
excitement during his residence. One reference, 
surprisingty. is In ginwing terns, the hwtiegger 
having braved the flames of a burning building to 
save Hs occupant's goM mteh. TTien be. loo. was 
gone to tbe Americaa side. He died in P-Tt 
Townsend of consumption, ending the black career 
of yet another of Victoria’s early-day sinners. 

Thomas Barnacle u.sually confined his 
bursts to verbal tirades but in November. 1864, 
deerasng a large broad axe mightier than words, 
threatened to "eut officer Parr^ open- ** 
Overpowered, be found htoLself in court and 
ordered into boftds to be of good behavior for 
three months. 

In August of MC6 he was fined five shillings 
for disturfoing (he peace. “Bqinacie—like the shell 
fish species of that name—is in the bahh <4 
clltnbiiig rocks, but uniil^ that marine 

speciment mounts the rostrum ftvr the Mia 
purpose of deliveiing an address to the starry 
hemisphere. He Is frequently found wh«i 
perched on some eminence gestkndating and 
articulating with great eenphasis. and is much 
pleased tf he can only succeed in attractine a 
Siwash auditory.” cbucMed the ne ws paper to 
shameless abandon. 

More than once, this desire to give a 
speech—in the early hours of the morning-led to 
court appearances. 

Jim White was an Indian wbi>se one love was 
to be a policeman, and he travt^led the streets 
complete with handcuffi and badge. Time and 
again, after a fe^v reinforciog draughts. Jim would 
appear at the police station, struggling prisoner in 
tow! And time and again angry officers would 
release the victim and throw poor Jim into the 

he had planned for his prisoner. 

Ftoaiiy exasperated city police gave bis 
handcuffs and badge to provincial police. Perhaps 
this at last quashed poor Jim's desire to be a 
constable for there seem to be no further 
references to his apprehending victims. 

These are but some of the hilariuis. tragto 
but likeable characters who have roamed Victoria 
streets over tbe years. Perhaps during our next 
centennial celebrations, in 1971. historians wiQ at 
last commemorate their valuable contribution to 
our heritage!

I Pack My Bag for Adventure 


^ By AGNES DUKE 

f doubt that I could have left such an enthusiast 
behind. There she teas, standing by expectantly, with 
a camera clutched in one hand and o sleeping bag in 
the other. So it teas that, as I busied myself teith the 
planning and packing for the first of a succession of 
short camping trips, it teas agreed that a young-at^heart 
and noUso-old-in^ears mother accompany me. This 
decision teas never regretted as she brought (dong, not 
only her camera and love of travel, but a keen sense of 
humor tehich made her on ideal companion. 


A childhood game begins; "I

This game, though often started by 
some rather unimaginative child, 
would in ail piTjbability be fesreed to 
accommodate the more precocious 
child who might well insist on 
stuffing this ficiicious bag vnth all 
sorts of impossible objecta before 
the game was finished. With this 
ditty from childhood running through 
my mind I began the very real task 
of “packing my bag for adventure.’* 
Thus it was that the Urst in the 
"bag" was Ann Wilson, mother, 
photographer ar»d adventurer! This 
proved standard procedure witt 
each successive trip we took in tfle 
years between 1953 and 1960.

ately dubbed the “gailoping grass¬ 
hopper", stood by Anxiously waiting 
to play his part in new venture. 
With a strong hearit and youthful 
eagerness he begged to be on the 
move. Though somewhat lacking in 
size to the station wagon or camper 
trucks more commtmly seen <»> the 
roads today, this mechanical frimd 
compensated with his keen sense of 
dependability and devotiMi. 

Preparing for our first trip, we 
bad the noble assistarwe of a very 
adlling (six • foot - tall) father and 
husband, to iwave the tent, poles, 
artd other sun^^ camixng gear, up 
to the higher reaches of the car-top 
carrier, and the same willing help in 
lashing these belongings in a secure 
fashion.

However, there suddenly arose a 
thought ef shuddering proportion. 
Neither I, a mere five foot two inches, 
nor my mother (five foot four Inches), 
could possibly reach up to uni^k or 
repack this little box in the sky! 

So after a brief consultation and 
a p e rhaps^we-had-better-take-him- 
along feeling, tiiis ingenious gentle¬ 
man appear^ with a solutlcm. A 
chopped down to size ladder. 

Thus it was that this child of 
traWh again cl^ts: 'T pack my 
bag” and adds to the already 
mountain of supplies, my tatter's 
ladder. 

Eventually with the trunk of ti3e 
“galloping grasshopper" stuffed full 
and an assortment of not-to-be* 
forgotten items tossed onto the back 
seat, we would be ready to leave our 
home in Victoria f<w a brief thou^ 
interesting trip with our cameras. 

Like my mother, I too, am an 
avid photographer^ and It Is this 
constant sear^ for new pictures 
that started us on our camping 
expeditions. Little did we realize 
that tiiese casual photo seeing trips 
would lead us into a world ct 
adventure. 

(government camp grounds pro¬ 
vide an ofoerwise impossible chuce 
for the city dwellers to capture a 
brief look at the greet outdoors. 
Neverttieless, I can hear the purists 
muttering that this Is all very well 
for the "dude" but this is a poor 
substitute for real adventure. 

True, this ntay well apply at the 
height of a busy season when camp 
grounds are full of summer tourists. 
Conversely, travelling fai the off 


season, as we were prone to do, has 
brought us a fair share of un^danned 
excitement. 

At Miracle Beach we experienced 
me such unexpected episode. Here 
is one of the lar^st campsites on 
Vancouver Island and the beautifully 
secluded' tent spaces offer a max¬ 
imum of luivacy, a matter which 
did not concern us, on this early 
September evening. 

We entered an almost deserted 
campsite as the sun was alippuig 
btHn sight and the few late campers 
were preparing to depart. We made 
camp, had a meal, and as there was 
no moon this ni^t, the enveloping 
darkness brought thoughts of sleep. 

We were soon comfortably settl^ 
for the night and fast asleep. I was 
suddenly aroused by the sound of 
coughing coming from a clcee 
proximity beyond the tent. I needed 
little encouragement to waken Ann 
and tugged at her feet to accomplish 
this, and conveyed to ter that 
something was amiss. 

Meanwhile, to corroborate my 
whispered alarm, a succession erf 
coughs was heard over the pmnding 
of my own heart. Now I could tear 
heavy teeathlng. By this time we 
had found the flasMight which I 
poked out erf the tent flap and shone 
through the impenetrable blackness 
to no avail. 

The coughing ceased momen¬ 
tarily. We envisioned all sorts of 
possible evil lurking outside the 
ineuiequate shelter of our tent. Was 
H man or beast that uttered this 
alarming sound, for truly we were 
more than a little alarmed, having 
lust read of an unsolved axe murder 
not many miles distant 

Speaking erf axes, where was 
ours? Not in the tent — that was 
established after a frantic search 
over the floor of the tent. It tor^ npt 
many mnnents after this realization 
to become rigid with fright. 

However this scene soon ritanged 
to one <rf action after a hastily 
iriiispered conference had us scur¬ 
rying for the safety pt me Austin 
with the sleeping bags clutched in 
our arms. Moments seemed boors 
before we were safely settled inside 
with the doras securely locked. 

We could breath easier now and 
tried to get comfortable in our 
confined quarters. I had taken my 
five-foot two-inches into the front seat 
where I managed somehow to fall 
asleep. 

However, Ann's slightly kHiger 


form was having less luck in Qie 
accommodation of the rear seat. 

Some few hours later I was 
awakened with the suggestion that 
we return to the tent. Ann reasoned 
that whatever had been prowling 
around must surely have departed 
by now. So we bundled ourselves 
and our sleeping bags back to the 
tent where we revelled in the fact 
that we could stretch out to full 
length again. 

Ihe tension of , a few hours 
previous left us and we slept until 
daylight had us up and ready for 
another day of adventure. 

As we emerged from the tent we 
became quite convulsed with laugh¬ 
ter as our eyes took in the scene 
around us. Not an inch of ground 
was left undisturbed by foot (rinta. 
Not from some imaginary axe 
yielding human intruder but the 
smaller imprints left by the deer 
family. 

Those beautiful creatures of the 
wild, so gentle and suspicious of 
man, were little aware of the 
moments of anxiety they had caused 
us. We felt a little^ foolish and a 
great deal wiser for this our first 
such experience camping in tiie 
"wilds’* of a Vanc)uver Island 
campsite. ' 

Undaunted by our previous 
night’s experience, we set about 
busily preparing to be on the move 
again. 

On leaving tite camping area we 
realized we had truly been alcme 
(but for our animal friends) as there 
was not another car or camper to be 
seen occupying the large maze of 
campsites. The exception being a 
lonely locrfcing tent down in the 
beach area where we found an 
equally lonely little woman. Sie, 
poor soul, had been brought out the 
previous day by her husband witii 
the idea of giving her a few days 
rest cure for her nerves! “To get 
away foam it all." 

She too, had spent one frighterung 
night in this tiie start of her h<rfklay, 
but unlike ourselves was ready to go 
home. However, she had one large 
problem. Her husband, a logger, had 
taken the car to his job in the woods 
where it was impossible to readi 
him by irfione. 

We stayed briefly trying to 
reassure her of the beauty around 
ter and telling her nil the while that 
there w»j,truly nothing of which to 
be frightened. We felt rattier 
hypocritical as we left this Icmdiy

back on our recent night of discom¬ 
fort and wonderedi how well we 
would have faced our ordead had we 
not bad the reassuring company of 
each other. 

From here we drove south again 
aa far as one of our favourite 
camping spots, Little Qualicum. 
Ibere is but a short drive from this 
central location to numerous likely 
photo spots. A few of the possibil¬ 
ities available to the photographer 
are Little Qualicum Falls. English¬ 
man River Falls, beaches at Qual-

the direction of the Albwni Valley is

capturing their grandeur on film. 

Devils Club grows high in this 
shaded area and even this, with all 
its psrickly forboding, may be 
captured in beauty with the sim 
catching its broad flat ^aves. Mobs 
and fern also grow abundantly and 
the more obs.ervant might chance 
upon the delicate and tiny stenu at 
the Irtdlan Pipe plant. 

With the day still young and 
forever hirnlng our eyes on new 
horizons, we might continue on the 
20 or so miles further west to Port 
Albemi Sproet Lake or Stamp 
Falls, returning to our campsite 
again by dark. 

At Port Albesni a few years ago 
we wwe able to leave the ear for a 


The journey up this long water¬ 
way was made interesting by its 
frequent stops at the numerous 
small settlements of to il ing and 
fishing industries. Canneries and 
mining concerns can also be found 
hi this area, and of course it is a 
great place f<v the sport tiMierman. 
The Mv. Uchuck carried supplies 
and passengers to these isiNated 
conununities. 

Sproat Lalm. a few nulea north of 
Albemi, was abo a favorite stopping 
place (although the campsites which 
now rim the lake's sandy beaches 
were yet to be constructed). Here on

use my camera to advantage. On 
the suggestion of the zoo keeper 
(who had noticed our frustrations in 
trying to photograph the liofia 
through the wire enclosure) Ann 
tmpulsiveiy accepted his offer to 
enter the cage! 

Once inside, and facing these 
fk fncujt beadts. she realized with 
alarm the extent of her imputsive- 
nesa. However, while I Med to 
maintain a sendilance of calm 
behind, the safety of wire, Ann 
braved* her experience for the sake 
of photography. An outward calm 
prevailed that belied her inward fear 
and trenfbUng and I began to know 
why she had the name of being a 
"good actress.’*

Off season travel, as we had 
chosen, was no guarantee tor good 
weather, 'nierefore. In poking oin- 
beads outside the tent each morning, 
we would quickly assess the photo 
possilMlities for that day. CM the 
duler days we naturally headed for 
epcD areas where we could saake 
use of interesting cloud efleete. On 
days when the blue patches in toe 
sky i«edo(ninatcd we would be filled 
with bopc and drive to the locations 
etoere we might capture toe picture 
that bad previously evaded us. 

On one such encouraging nioming 
we were up and dieted by 6:3# 
ajB. and with the gas stove and food 
box hurriedly bundled into toe ear 
we headed for Cathedral Grove. 

Sitting at the edge of the forest, 
CTi toe batik of the Cameron River, 
we listened to the gentle ripfrfe of 
water owr the smooth round stones, 
heard toe birds calling their morn¬ 
ing song, and heard, and enjoyed the 
aroma, of sizzling bacon and hot 
percolated coffee as we awaited our 
Iweakfast. 

‘Whether we found a toousand and

eoosequence at toe moment. To 
become saturated with the beauties

(where of course more excellent 
campsites may now be found) we 
chanced upon a zoo. This zoo, toough

such large animals as cougars and

species. It is of the liooa tbaf my 
memory retains a picture. I say 


Altoough the lions’ behavior was 
a eredit to their keeper, our nerves 
nevertoeiess needed fortification af¬ 
ter this episode. 

It was beside the fast flowing 
falls ot the Stamp River that we 
regained our composure. We mean¬ 
dered aroimd the wooded trails that 
follow toe course of the river and 
enjoyed the somebnies fipfding and 
sometiiaes thimdering of the fast 
waters. We finally left this peaceful 
though vigorous scene and after a 
short drive were settled in our 
campsite for our last night under

Of bQ the spring vegetables, asparagus is

namely the iweparation and eating of food. This 
master cook says of asparagus "the best way to 
prepare this d^eacy is by steaming.** 

"By steaming,** he explains, "o>dy the stalks 
are subject to the vigoroia boiling and the tender 
tips gently cook in the steam.** lids combination

DEAR HELOISE: 

Since children nowadays 
don’t like to wear house 
slippers after they put on 
their jtajamas, we use 
daddy’s odd socks to put 
over each little tootsie while 
they run around tbe house 
after thMr bath. 

This is aqieeially good-K 
they wear steepers with feet 
in them ss it saves mother

There was much activity in the Victoria of April, 1894 - three-quarters of a century ago. 
Tliere were music^ entertainments, parades, dances, fashionable weddings, naval band 
concerts; tfae.l^islators were hammering away at each other, in just about the same 
manner as goes on in our legislature of today- There were also bold robberies, runaway 
horses paralysing the citiaienry in fright, and bad boys throwing stones and pulling the 
pigtails of Chinese laondrymen- 

Seventy-Five Years Ago . . . 


By JAMES K. NESBITT 

Victoria had its seamy side as 
stell as Us high society. The setiing 
fleet teas based here, and the young 
and bearded crews were not given 


Vignettes of Victoria’s seamy side, 
legislative proceedings, weddings 
and religious bigotry 


to retiring at 10, so that they could 
arise early and attend church. Who 
cmi really blame them? Their Pa¬ 
cific Oceem voyages were not easy, 
and lives were constantly m danger 
and frequently lost* And so they 
let of^steam in Victoria and in 
fokohama — both of svhich lively 
seaports had certain hot spots 
where the sailors could forget the 
perils of the sea. 

r think the foUovfiV Hem in The 6oloiJ.t 
giwi us a.perfect gtinapM o< Kaling ship dars: 

-R. Marwick oC tfaa Vtctoria sealing acboaoer 
Vent, and Robert Irvine ol flv’ May BeOe, have 
retined from rokwitagna by the Eteyrgaa of 
Japan on sick leave. 

“They left the Japaneae ports deserted by our 
sealing craft, only one of ttw fleet bene now in 
port in the Land ol the Risiiig Sun — the aohooner 
Aurora. 

“She had put to sea a day or two previous to 
the Empress' -a ilin g, but just outside Tcritoheima 
{ b re a k wa ter she woa rw down by an unknewn 
steamer, her bowsprit being cut clean away, and 
she being. thereby forced back to make good 
dami^es Luckly, no one wae lost or injured in 
the collision. 

"Not so fortunate was , a boat^ crew 
bekmging to the Agnes MacEktnald, which left 
that schooner on a perfecHy calm day a fear 
weeks ago and have never been seen since. 

"There were, as tmial, three men in the boat, 
the hunter, Charles Will^ns. having with him ■ 
Samuel Lewis, son at Indian officer Lewis and 
himself well known as an am.-iteur atlilete, with 
another Victorian. 

"Night coming on. signal lights were iiiow& 
and guns fired tran the achooner, but without 
avail. The night proved the reverse of die day, a 
barrieane raging, in wliicb no boat could live, and 
thou^ the schooner devoted a week to searching 
the neighborhood lor the bwt boat, neither it nor 
its crew were heard of again. 

"There were no other schooner* in the 
vicinity which could have idcked dmn up, wtii<^ 
makes their deaths by the storm almost a 
certainty. 

"The residents of Japan are taking a lively 
Interest in the British Oolumbi') Indians who form 
part at the crews at the sealing schooners Fawn 
and Rosie Olaen, and they, in dieir turn, are 
enthusiastic about die Japanese whisky and sake. 
In the obtaining of which they experience no 
ddficutty."

One fine day in April of 11194 Vietoria's top- 
drawer society went to a baraar. In InsUtue Hall, 

In aid at Jubilee Hospital:

"Busy young ladies are fai charge <rf the

" 'Sweet Chartty* alone is the motive that 
moves these ladies to bring about all this, for it is 
the bazaar for the Jidnlee, and who ooukl grudge 
a helping hand to that institution, whose aims are 
to care for the sick and suffering?

Seventy-five years ago this time of year a 
legislative session was prorogued, as abso happens 
so often in more modem Aprils. In those day%, 
however, there was as much pomp and 
cimimstance at prwog a tion as on c^nii^ day. 

Somewhere through the yean, the fuss-anit 
featfiers of prorogati<xi was pitched out the 
window. Today tlie lieutenant-govemm' goes to 
the House without any beating of drums, firing at 
guns, playing of bands, inspecting of honor guards. 
Today His Honor arrives quietly, says hk piece, 
leaves quietly. 

Here’s the prorogatiwi day; 

‘Tlbe fourth and final session at the sixth 
Legislature of . British Columbia was f<HTnally 
brought to a dose — there was a large 
attendance at the ceremony — Uie reserved 
chairs placed upon the floor of the House were all 
occud^. there being a large number of ladies 
present, and the galleries also were crowded. 

"Outside the legislative buildings — w the 
'bird-cages' as they are known in the vernacular 
—was likewise a large crowd of spectators ii> 
terested in tbe attendant military ceremonies. 

"The Union Jack, flying from the main 
departmental building, jiroclaimed the hdiday 
event to all passers-by, and several persons had 
g a thered about the grounds and In the Drill Hall, 
where the Guaid at Honor paraded for inspection. 

"Ibe guard was in command of Capt. W. B. 
Smallfield, while Sgt.-Maj. Mulcahy was as usual 
much in evidence, keeping a watchful eye to see 
that no detail of the preparadoos should be 
omitted. 

"His Honor (Edgar Dewdney) arrived 
promptly, at course in his official uniform and 
cocked bat, accompanied in his carnage by-Mai. 
P-. Ae. Irving as AJ).C. 

"His Honor entered the chamber flanked by 
James Peters, Maj. G. A. L. Rewstome 
and Capt. A. W. Jones, all in the glory of nrilHary 
fuO dress. ' 

"Tbe Premier — Hon. Theodore Davie — and 
his ccdleagues of the Executive Cfouneil — wMh 
the exceptiixi of Hon. C. E. Pooley. who is in 
England, were in ttieir places, well satisfied with 
their work at the session, and so were nearly afi 
file members of the Legislature. 

"The Legislature opened on the 18th of 
January and thus lasted only one week less than 
three months, being in length about the average 
of recent years." 

This is surprising; it appears file MLAs of 75 
yean ago were more long-winded than MLAs of 
today. There were only 33 then; now there are 5S. 
and yet the 1969 session was two vweks ihnrt^ 
than the 1894 session. R's almost impossible to 
believe, but it’s a fact, so you’d better believe M. 

Victoria teachers were paid $60 a month in 
1894, and the principals $74 —and many people 
said it was flar much, considering that 
teaching was not a difficult job. Teachers should 
be more dedicated, said certain people, and their 
rewards should be in satisfaction, not In dollars. 

In those day* there was no powerful teachers*

Mtwr nrdon, as there Is today. Just the same, fte 
Seacbert were banded together in their own 
association, which met once a month for a 
discussion of the various problems of tbs 
classroom. X can find no evidence that the 
teachers in 1894 asked for a raise in pay. 

Ihis is Ibe Colaoist account of a teachers’ 
meeting in 1894 

“A paper by Mr. S. B. Netherby on ‘the 
teaching of EngUsh literature to junior pupils’ 
was read and discussed by Miss Lawstm and 
Messrs. Tait, McNeill, Saliaway and Ross. 

’’After a song by Mr. Saliaway, another paper 
on 'Primary Reading' was read by Miss Spiers. It 
was bright, practical and very ityterestii^; H 
advocated a system of teaching which embraces 
the good features of the phonics and ‘look-and-see’ 
methods, and elicited a likely discussion, pro and 
oon. 

“Mr. Paul was unavoidaUy absent.'’ 

* * it 


When I read erfd newspapora 1 am always 
fascinated to see the accounts of the weddings in 
high life, as marriages in the circles of the elite 
were dubbed. 

In that era a list of dte presents was always 
^ven, and the name of who sent them. What a 
wonderful idea! A talking point for days! I would 
think scMne ‘catty’ comments flew about, like 
this: “With aU their money, and they send a 
cup and saucer—guess that's why they're rich.” 

Ihe 1894 marriage of the year, as far as 
Victoria was concerned, took place in Malta, 
between Ueut. Aylmer H. Garnons-Wiliiams of 
H.M.S. Camperdown, and Miss Edith Laetitia, 
third daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. C. Ward of 
Highwood. Victoria. 

The presents were listed as follows: “Mr. and 
Mrs. Ward, cheque; Lieut. F. A. Gibbon, fruit 
dishes: Lady Al^ander, pearl and diamond pin; 
the Misses Pemberton, gold tie pin. 

“Miss Ward, silver mounted looking glass; 

Mr. Justice and Mrs. M. W. Tyrwhitt-Drake. 
-Uver mounted glass; Mrs. J. D. Pemberton, 
cheque; the Miss Powell, lace handkerchief; Mr. 

W. Murray silver buttmhook and shoe-hom; Miss 
Eileen Ward, silver mounted glove stretchers; 

Mr. Justice and Mrs. Henry Pering Pcllew 
Crease, silver sugar spoons and tongs. 

“Mr. and Mrs. B. W. Pearse, cheque; the 
Lieutenant-Governor and Mrs. Edgn* Dewdney, 
pear] star brooch; Mr. and Mrs. Evan Thomas, 
long silver buttonhor^ and two cut glass scent 
bottles, silver mounted; Mr. and Mrs. E. Crow 
Baker, silver frames. Dr. and Mrs. Hanington,

’"nie Misses James, blotters; Miss Wigan,

It surprises me—the number of cheats in 
those days. I would have thought such a 
practice would have been considered vulga^. Yet 
It was done in the best families, as we see. j, wish 
I knew the amounts of the cheques. I will liever 
koow. *• \ 

Reeding a list like this I wonder w-hat the 
newlyweds did with all the buttonhooks, shhe- 
hesms, glove stretchers and blotters.

Seventy-five years ago the Odd Fellows of 
Victoria marked the 75th birthday of their 
orders — so now in this year, they are 150 years 
old, and still going sirtxtg. 

The rain poured down in Victoria that day, 
but put no dapipencr on the proceedings, though 
everyone in the big parade, and the hardy 
spectators, got a good soaking. 

Hm Colonist gave some details—the Van- 
eofver visitors were the first to arrive, 175 
stncMig, by the steamer Premier—the New 
Weetminster party came in the Princess 
Louise—the Wellington and Nanaimo brethem 
came down by special, brightly decorated train, 
the fine Wellington brass brind with them-^the 
steams WiUapa brought a big delegation from 
Port Angeles. 

“Despite the inclement weather there was a 
large crowd on Douglas Street to witness the 
splendid parade. Banners were flying, and the 
Odd Fellows wore their full regalia. 

'“nie Grand Ball in Assembly Hall in the 
evening was a fitting and altogether appropriate 
close to the celebration. Nearly 500 ladies and 
gentlemen were in attendance, and with delightiid

“The ladies of the Rebektdi Lodge were in

I like this account of an 1894 Victoria wedding: 

“Last evening dupid's Anvil was a^in in 
demand. 

“On this occasion it was down at 8 Pi meer 
Street, on the Elsguimalt harborfront, and the 
golden band was placed around the finger of Miss 
Sarah Robertsem Firth late of Liverpool. Eng., by 
Mr. John Moar of this city. 

“Mr. Heddle very ably supported the 
bridegroom and Mias Qiristine Robertson acted 
as bridesmaid. 

‘*Wr. James Flett gave Miss Firth away and 


after the always-interesting ceremMiy of tying 
the life-knot by Rev. Harrie A. Webb, the hearty 
congratulatiwis and best wi.shes of the friends 
assembled were given, and then all sat down to a 
deli^ttfu! su]>per which had been prepared by the 
band hostess. Mr«. James Flett.” ^ 

(Tupid's Anvil? I looked up the word anvfi, 
and didn't quite like what it means, as applied to 
marriage. Here's the definitkm I found: “Heavy 
iron block on which a smith hammers metal into 
shape. Cupid’s Anvil? Does it mean that Cupid 
was hammering somebody or other into shape? It 
sounds positively frightening. Whose head was on

FRANCES NIXON AT HOME ON THETIS ISLAND. 


By GERALDINE WELD 


On the peaceful gulf tMland of Thetis^ a ehort 
ferry trip across from Chemminust a nete knowledge of 
electromagmetie waver in tlMHr relation to biology^ bar 


been direow e red. 


This is coming very close to tbe 
magnetic waves of VIvaxis. 


That bH Bring tilings are coi>- 
duettws yvi generators d these 
Universal magnetic forces is se¬ 
eded. What is Dew, in Vlvaxls. The 
Spiral of Ute is the use of than. In 
the paper back. Our Huxnaa Body 
pubti^ied by Readers Digest, an 
article on cells by J. D. Ratchcliff 
and Rutherford Platt says that tbe 
DJ'l.A. molecule, aliieh is exactly 
the same in a housefly, your dog, or 
yon, has tte capacity of a magDetie 
reeordiiiK tape. They use the words, 
**tlie step* of a spiral staircase.’* to 
describe the nubs of four kin^ of 
nitrogen compounds on the inaide od 
tbe mdecule wfiich are respan&ible 
far turning out wood or muscles, 
leaves or longs, fins, wings or legs, 
81 the case may be. 


In the title VIvaxis, Viva . . . 
means life. Axis ... is the point 
wbere all forces come into a centre 
poioft. They explain, “it is tiw name 
we have given fa the geograi^icai 
point whm magnetism was intro¬ 
duced fato a person or object, a point 
where a magnetic pattern beoosnes 
set.’* 

*11110 work of Frances Nbmn and 
Bessie O’Caniwr ties in with the 
scientific authorities, then goes one 
step beyond. 


“Tbe radlatim energies of the 
earth torm a massive network of 
ener gy waves travelling in hori< 
xental and vertical f4anes. When a 
fetus or ^ject involved is subjected 
lo energy waves and currents being 
drawn from opposite directions, 
ouiTMits puU the horizontal and 
vertical energies into a c«»nmon 
axis. The fetus or object, as a 
result, becomes magnetized to that 
point.’* 

This point then, for all your life 
is ymr own individual magnetic 
p<^e, to which, like a compass, the 
atofnic energies of your body arc 
naturally aligned; at^ from wbich, 
if outside agents such as radiation 
and X-rays do not disrupt the 
hormony; these life giving forces 
will continue in a twowvay magnetic 
wave link to Row between it and 
you. 

With this bit of background it is 
easier to understand Frances Nix- 
qd’s amazement that day six years 
when her c^iance experiment 
produced the startling result that 
painted the way to what was fa 
become her life woric. 

Tbe dip-sUck that she was using

In this beautifid place tbe obvious 
thii^ would be to r^ax and let the 
world go by, but here, Frances 
Nbc<m has nwked with a single 
minded deterniinatioe to unravel a 
biological mystery. 

It was six years ago that she 
stumbled across an . . . Effect . . . 
of wbich she doesn't understand the 
. . . Cause. At toe time sihe was 
using a wafer diviner** dip stick aod 
testing the insulatli^ properties of 
paper, rubber, doth and lead to 
interrupt the flow of magnetisna

Rnd on elecCromagnetism, Earih 
curxenfa. toe use at eleeO-ical 
eqiapment in medicine to measure 
impulses frons the homw body, the 
carbon 14 test; all theae. she warn 
convinced were in some way related 
to her own startling experience. 

’Thinking of tt casualty one 
expects any scientifle break-through 
to mmam from a labomtory wMi 
equfament and toe backing of feflow 
scientists to d evelop an kfcc. 
However, an apple hit Newton oa 
tiw head, and Edtoow hadn’t a 
degree in science. Hiatoryjs fail oi 
ttieae nattwal sekatiato who have 
stutobed (Ml a savingly weird, 
unlotewB law and flaed the towb 
borwess of an enquiring mind ta 
unlock aootoer secret for the use id 
mankind. 

For Francea Nison this cat- 
periBwe. which is given in detail 
further on, was tiie hegianfag of her 
years of study and reaeanto. 

Durug this last year she baa had 
a cn-worfcer. Mrs. Beade O'Ocauior. 
a high sitonol teadier wbom she had 
know 30 l^iprs hefoee in Port 
Neville when hw husband Dick 
Nbeon, a forestry engineer, was 
workiog there. Sfeeting again slier 
this gap of yeara, Besaie OXSonnor 
knew nothing of tola iiae a c c ii la 
whidi Frances bad become oonv- 
pletriy absorbed, and which, by last 
year, she had developed into a 
biological science. The key to 
hareessisg these magnetie energies 
and using them to revitalize the 
magnetic ciitgiit in the body, had 
been found. 

“Frances had great stacks of 
nc^s.” 9ossie saidL “she had 
recorded «ach experiment, the fail¬ 
ures and tbe puzzles at ^ years, 
and tbe successes. They had all been 
tested and re-tested by her husband 
and friends, and corroborated.’* 

They decided that toese findings 
to date should be published. ‘T felt 
at once, completely certain,” Bessie 
O’Oonnor told me, “toat what 
FVaneee was doing was a true break* 
tfBTKigh toat eotrid mean a new 
eoncept of health and understanding 
af nature’s laws tor e v eryone.** 

So Bessie moved her trailer iwer 
Id ’Thetis Island and began the 
difflcult job of arranging the mass 


of notes, **1 thought I wpald go 
mad,” she latched, “there wa« ao 
mucti, and of course aU the tone I 
was learning and Frances was 
teaching me bow fa get well again.’* 

At this time Bessie had been 
forced to give up teariiing becaase 
of ill healtb. To see her raw yos can 
scarcely believe that she is CS. and 
she gives full credit for her celuroed 
health to this new vital knowledge 
that Fruwn Nixon has discowered. 
No wonder toat Bessie O'Comor is a 
dedicated woman. 

The result of this collaboration is 
their book. VIVAXIS. The Spiral of 
life . i . published by Abbey Books.

African animals — obscure diseases, or 
something from Outer Space? 

Not at all; they are smaK, but beautiful, 
alpine plants, and they, and many others will be 
on view at the Spring Show of the yanccMver 
Island Rock and Alpine Garden Society to be heid 
in the Memorial-Hall of Christ Church. Cathedral 
April 25 and 26. 

This annual event has won critical aodaim 
lor many years and draws visitors from 
Washington, Oregon and even from as far away as 
California. For here is a world in miniature, 
embracing not only native plants from Vancouver 
Island and many other parts of the American 
continent but also rarities from all over the 
world. 

It is the aim of the society in the future to 
vary the dates on which the show is held so as to 
be able to include boto early and late blooming 
plants and thus add even more variety to an 
already fascinating display. 

Although the society's best known activity Is 
undoubtedly die Spring Show it is also active in 
other ways. 

Conservation is becoming of increasing 
eonoem to all nature lovers and this is something 
whkdi every member IwMs ve^ near his heart. 

Matty a treasure has been rescued from the 
bulldozer's iron tread where a new road or 
■ubdiviriaa was about to iiestray an area of 
meadow or forest. Such, plants are divided among 
as auny gardens as posdUe in enter that stocks 
may build up and multiply.

The trouble is fiiat these diverse

to time, fiiae is a faint resemblance 
in style to these three famous 
authors. But none of those ladies 
would ever have committed the 
cardinal error erf packing so much 
into one book as to make it difficult 
fox* the reader to keep an interest in 
all that is going on. Particulaily 
when so much of it goes on in the

It is to be earnestly hoped that 
fins exciting new American novehst

The Luck of the Laird 



Sir Widler Scott died 
in 1832 full of years and 
honors, a writer revered 
in his lifetime cu a co>n- 
bination of, Shakespea^ 
and Samuel Johnson. ISor 
has his reputation as a 
novelist been seriously 
shaken since, though 
some cridcs nowadays do 
tend to dismiss him as 
a cloak~and-dagger ro^ 
ntancer. But there is on- 
other side to Scott: the 
imperial spender who set 
out to establish a noble 
house of Scott at Abbots¬ 
ford, his huge manor 
overlooking the Tweed. 

It is to this latter aspect that 
Eric Quayle addresses himself in 
this querulous book, and tt is about 
as effective in its debunking as the 
periodic attempts by biograirfiers to 
show what a foot Mark Twain was 
as businessman. Quayle has written 
extensiveJy about the Ballantyne 
family, who were Scott's printers 
and who went bankrupt nhen 
financial min overtook him. It will 
be remembered that Scott's son-in* 
law, John Gibson Lockhart, wrote a 
classic biograi^y of Scott in which 
be exonerated him from Uame. 

Quayle contends, however, that 
Lockhart manipulated facts, altered 
letters, and in other ways sought to 
clear Scott at the expense of toe 
Ballantynes. This book is knit a 
J’aceaae aimed at Sir Walter Scott 
and his biographer. Turning to the 
novel to bis forties, Scott wrote aO 
of his romances in eighteen yean, 
producing them at toe pace of • 
machine. They became immensely 
popular earned him huge sums 
at money » but not enough to keep

him in the style In itoich he wished 
to bve. 

Abbotsf<»d, his country seat, was 
k magnificent mansion standing in a 
spacioufi e^te that extended down 
to the banks of the Tweed. Acctird* 
ing to Quayle, Sir Walter lived in 
feudal splendor, spending extrava¬ 
gantly not only what he earned but 
also what he Iwped to earn. 

So tor from diminishing Scott, 
ttds book actually wins s^me 
sympetliy for Mm. Sr Walter lived 
in an aetstoeratte age, was raised to 
toe aristocracy himself, and sought 
to live like a laird. In ow day this 
might be considered snobbish or 
eoc«)tzto, but It was far from being 
so to his time. As tor the feudal 
s]riendor, bear to mind that as 
novelist Scott had immersed himself 
to the age of knighthood and 
chivalry. &nall wonder that he 
sought to recreate it for himself. 

Instead of taking refuge in 
bankruptcy, Scott underiO'>k to write 
himself out of debt, and duly did so. 
What debts remained after his death 
Lockhart repaid from the success of 
his nine-volume biography. No 
doubt, as Quayle contends. Scott was 
a pcdlticaJ reaetlnnar>' who resisted 
social change, but this is not a 
heinous crime. Nor was his Hnai^ 
cial irresponsibility. 

Who remembers today that Bert- 
hoven was a curmudgeon or Swift a 
misanthrv^te w: Oscar Wilde a 
convicted hemosexual? What counts 
in an artist is his art. Tliough 
Qua^e makes out a case for the 
BaHantynes, toe plain fact is that 
toey are remembered in history 
chiefly because they hapj^ened to bo 
Scott's printers.—J.B.

SHADES OP DIFFERENT, 
By OoBBtaare Bartauito; St. 
MBrita’s: IM pp; $4.t5. 


In toe last fow years there have 
been many books about relatitxis 
between black people and white, but 
none has sounded exactly this note: 
there may lurk a hidden prejudice in 
the mind of one who considers 
himself a champion of social into* 
0 «tk». Such a protestant is Greg, a 
hi^ school boy whose growing 
friendship with a Negro lad he has 
met while working at a recreation 
centre is resented by his friends and 
approved by his father. Greg’s girl 
tries to be neutral, but she is 
■iwrintM to keep toe attoi'oval of their 
circle, and Greg himself a 

social dropout. After aH this, he is 
stunned by his own reaction when a 
iriitte prl at the centre introduces 
her Negro fiance. Ages 13*15. 


An Examined Life 

Expmences tg precis(dy what it says — the con¬ 
templation of a long life'by a famous historian on 
attainmg his 80tk yiar. Who among us does not hope 
to grow old yet dreads old age? Toynbee is the excep¬ 
tion. In this book, serene and at peace with himself, 
he looks on old age as W’alt W hitman did — **calm, ex¬ 
panded, broad with the haughty breadth of the uni- 


Death bolds no terrors for him. b 
is oaly physical infirmiQr ttuu he 
tears. "The date of my own death 
cannot now be far off," be writes, 
yet sees death as a supreme 
incongruity of the human oondiiion. 
Man is endowed with certain 
spiritual and mental capaciti«^ 
which enable him to explore tne 
universe intellectually (and s< <00 
actually), "yet at -the same time ne 
is as short-lived and insignificant as 
a midge." By comparison with cur 
physical stamina our mental capaci¬ 
ties are colossal: "Why," asks Toyn* 
bee, “Bbould there be this mi^t?" 

A good question, and perhaps one 
that can never be answered. Reed¬ 
ing it one is reminded of Gertrude 
Stein’s sibylline last words: "What 
is the answer? What is the 
question?" Looking down the kxig 
corridor of his years, Toynbee finds 
no certain answers to pressing 
questions he asks in this unsparing 
scrutiny. In his lifetime he has seen 
great wars, watched captains and 
kings depart, empires fall, and the 
order and certainties of las youth 
give place to turbulence and confus¬ 
ion. His own monumental "Study of 
nist(» 7 " has given him a persepec- 
tive cn toBnan affairs denied the 
rest ol us. In this book he speaVs 
frankly of what he believes and 
expects. 

Some of his most revealing 
thoughts lie in the field of religion. 
Over the years his Christiaalty has 
yielded to agnosticism, and in one 
remaricabie passage he cites chapter 
and verse as to why he can no 
longer accept the Christian thesis.

- Nor, for that matter, can he ad^eiw 
to any of the other maior religions, 
save, perhaps, to certain aspects of 
F 'ddhism. This chapter is specific, 
detailed, logical. Yet, ToynbM con¬ 
cludes, man needs religion, and 
some universal faith will surely have 
to evolve in the future. "ReligicHi is 
a search for the ultimate spiritual 
prin iple of the universe.” 

Toynbee, tells us, too. how ha 
came to history as a life career. It 
was Ms mother who inspired him 
with her love of facts. He. too, loves 
facts, he says, not for themselves 
a 1 '>ne but as clues to the nature and 
meaning of the mysterious universei 
..ATMIe sesme of toe book is deeply 
^)[tcrsonal, other chapters deal with 
contemporary events in Toynbee's 
familiar style, that is. measured 
against the past. Most disturbing to 
American readers is his view tiutt m 
a people we have become "militaris¬ 
tic." and be cites Vietnam as an 
example of the manner in which we 
have been "comipted” by our 
power. Even though peace may 
come to Vletoam this >*ear, he 
bebevee that "the world’s view of 
America will never again be to* 
same as it was before ” 

It is not often that the reviewer 
can reenmraend a book as reprceent- 
ing the distilled wisdom of a long 
and reflective life, but this is such a 
book. It was Socrates vbo said that 
the mexamined life was not worth 
living. Toynbee, ftil! %-ery much 
alive, here examines his life In a 
manner that should set us all to 
thinking.

the anvil—bride or groom. I have 
my own private idea. 

It was an age of religious bigotry, 
which today, to a very great extent 
7 as passed completely away for 
which let us all be duly thankful. 

Here's an 1894 adverfisement I 
came across: 

"CcKning to Victoria — ex-priest 
Slattery and wife of Dublin, Ireland 
—series of lectures at Philharmonic 
Hall. 

"Ifis equal has ne>’er been heard 
before in Victoria. His lectmet will 
be the talk of the city. 

"He is gifted, eloquent and witty 
and challenges any {Hiest cr bishop 
to meet him in debate. 

*^ou will see scxnething you 
aever saw before—a priest's wife. 
Mrs. Slattery know as Sister Bfary 
EUizabeth in tlte convent—speaks for 
ladies cxily on Friday aftemoca. She 
was resmed from the convent by her 
XMisin, Lady Morton. 

"Mr. Slattery is engaged to a 
frand work. Many CathoUca, after 


nearing him. say toey have gone 
X> their last confession, and had 
Kneeled to a Catlx^ic (n-iest for the 
last time. 

"Believe nothing that, you hear 
ir read that is uncomplimentary to 
Mr. Slattery or his lectures. Remem¬ 
ber all such are writen i^ perstma 
who are prejudiced. Resolve to he^ 
aim for yourself." 

Now, what happened about all 
this 1 do not know. The adv ertise- 
ncot appeared in the newspapers on 
mly one day, and there was_Bbao- 
tutely no in^s mention given to the 
Siadriy lectures. 

Ud Mr. Slattery fail to arrive 
tere? Did the newspapers ignore 
aim in order that their Otholie 
readers not to be initutted, and so 
cancel subscriptions? 

I do not knem-. and I have ne 
way of finding cut. 

Is there anyone in Victoria today 
aho lemembers "Sir. Slattery to 
1894? Omld be!

OOU.BCTIMI’S SAMPfX CASE FROM ONE U>CATION. 


Photo Story By DONOVAN CLEMSON 

Few luaural ob^ts excite more curiosity than 
concretions* These unusual stones are bound to be 
noticed wherever they occur because their very appear¬ 
ance seems to many observers to be unnatural and 
contrived. Some of them could be the products of the 
lathe, others could have b^n stamped out by cooks 
with cookie cutters while the more ^nsymmotrica/ 
could be attributed to doodling by apprentice sculptors* 
Whatever their shape, their unusual conformation sets 
them apart from ordinary pebbles* 


You don't need to tax the 
imagination very much to see 
animal forms in some types at 
concretions, rabbits, seals and pen¬ 
guins being common while the 
higher forms including the human 
are sometimes represented. These 
•bmes must have aroused the 
curioeity of the native Indians bef<HO 
white men and geologists arrived to 
**e]cpiain” them, for ocaicretians are 
oecasionaily found on Indian sites 
along with the flint points and stone 
artifacts weli known to coUetAors. 

In my opinion die business 
toqilaining concretions bas never 
been convincingly demonstrated by 
tidiite men and geologists. Pertiaps 
the fridians have more {dausible 
theories, but not having discussed 
the subject with them I do not know. 
However, I am far from satisfied 
widi the theories propoiBided in 
geological textboc^. 

Ooncretions occur naturally in clay 
deposits, sandstones and gravels and 
may be any size from slender 
twiglets the size ctf matches to 
iqiecimens -several feet long and 
weighing many pounds. Geologists 
agree that they are fpnned ki sites 
by some process not understood but 
probably through the agency of 
certain minerals which cement the 
particles of the deposit together. It 
k thought th^ some concretions 
’“grow” around a nucleus such as a 
small twig and thus assume its 
shape, but no specimen tfiat I have 
bitten has revealed any sign of 
Such.

Some. Indeed, have holes through 
die centre, and the geologist ex¬ 
plains this with the theory that the 
bote was the twig that formed the 
nucleus but has since rotted away. 

Very plausible this, and I accept 
it until I found concretions this 
type actually in the making in the 
mud X3t the South Thompson river 
bed. They were identical with the 
bard specimens I have ccdlected 
from the vicinity, but they had 
hardoied only to the degree neces¬ 
sary to withstand the gentle current 
action of this lazy river, and could 
be squashed easily by the hand. 

These incipient concretions had 
boles in the middle, a circumstance 
which effectively demoUsbed the 
twig theory. 

Another puzzling feature o< con¬ 
cretions is the variation of type and 
shs^. Why should one kwatkn 
produce round ccmcretions and an¬ 
other long slender ones? Nobody 
seems to know, but this peculiarity 
of these fascinating stones gives 
almost unlimited scope to the 
ooUeotor. A ramble along an Arrow 
Lakes beach at low water turned up 
a number fo specimens shaped like 
thimbles and limpet shells. What is 
these in the Columbia mud that (he 
Fraser hasn't got? 

A site on the South 'nwomson 
river in Ihe picturesque White Silt 
yields concretions in the term dl 
doughnuts, collars, rings, erescenk 
and other variations Ot the circular 
motif. The Shuswap river In the 
same watershed yields remarkable 
slender “beans” up to two feet long, 
while Adams Lake, fai the same 
water system, produces tboueands of 


almost identical specimens circular 
in plan and elipticat in section 
r^embling buns, from a varve clay 
which imparts a distinctive layered 
texture to toe concretions. 

In these Adams Lake concretions 
when twinning occun in the form 
of a small concretion attached to a 
larger specimen the resemblance to 
a turtle is very striking. Collectors, 
of course, go for the odd shapes, the 
unusual and su^eetive, which at^ 
actually quke scarce in toe Adams 
Lake deposits, and when found are 
alt toe more rewarding on toat 
account. 

The Adams Lake varve clays are 
so tilled with concretions at some 
locations that they fenm a sort of 
pebble beach where the waves have 
eroded them from the deposit. And 
here is another puzzle for the 
geologist — toe accretions do not 
occur ev«ily or even sporadically 
through the clay deposit In some 
places they're plentiful and In others 
entirely absent —» 

Just about everyone, I believe, 
responds to concretkeu, and for tots 
reason they’re useful things to have 
around .the house when entertaining 
guests. If the conversation lags, a 
few coocretions handed around wiB 
revive it. You will not have to rack 
your brains to think of something to 
say; you’ll be too busy anstvering 


questions. Even the most proaaio 
types can be stimulated tois way. 

Some friends of mine who are 
ardent and experienced collectors 
once took their local butcher along 
on a concretion hunt. 'The site 
chosen was a river side clay deposit 
where digging had to be resorted to 
as the surface specimens had long 
since been collected. On finding tbe 
first specimm the butcher became 
excited, and my friends reported 
that this fellow sp«tt several hours 
digging, with excited yelps, in the 
clay, for all toe world like a spaniel 
digging out gophers. 

By the end of the day ttik 
butcher was a mass of clay and not 
really fit to be seen, but he was 
happy as a clam, having a ^hole 
bagful ot specimens for his pains. 

I had a somewhat similar ex¬ 
perience when I took a neighbor on 
a collecting expedition to Adams 
Lake. AKhough over GO my friend 
had never seen a concreticoi but on 
reattoing the beach where specimens 
were to be found he became much 
excited, and, spotting eonoretions 
under toe water, waded in without 
bothering to remove ^K>e8 and 
trousers. Be spent hk tinw wal¬ 
lowing in the cold water and 
succeeded in collecting all the choice 
specimens to the chagrin of those 
too timid to get their feet wet.
