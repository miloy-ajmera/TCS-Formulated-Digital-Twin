Analysis 


CHICAGO, March 16— Pres- 
ident. Ford’s victory over Ron-; 
aid Reagan in 111 mods today 
was built on three main founda- 
tions: his success in pre-empt- 
ing issues, the belief among 
Republicans that 
he is both honest 
and electable and 
indications of an 
improving, econ- 
omy. The scope of Mr. Ford’s 
triumph, based cm a New York' 
Times/CBS News poll of 1,060 
voters who had cast their bal- 
lots, was far more impressive 
than in his narrow New Hamp- 
shire and Florida victories. He 
has now taken five straight 
If Mr. Reagan stays in the 
race, which most Republicans 
considered pointless in view of 
the results in Illinois and else- 
where, he will probably do bet- 
ter in North Carolina next 
week, although he trails there. 

if the Californian had hoped 
that conflict-of-interest charges 
leveled last week against the 
President’s campaign' chairman, 
Howard H. Callaway, .would 
help him There, he was disap- 
pointed. . 

The Times/CBS poll indicated 
that the Callaway " issue had 
made no difference to voters 
of this populous stale, often 
called an- American microcosm. I 


Only 5 percent said that the 
Callaway episode influenced 
their votes, while 60 percent 
said that it had not mattered. 

Jimmy Carter won his long- 
sought victory in a Northern 
industrial state. But he won it 
under circumstances that fore- 
told little about hts prospects 
in those other industrial states, 
such as New York. Pennsyl 
vania and Michigan, where he 
will be tested by his main 
rivals, Henry M. Jackson , and 
Morris K. UdalL 
Neither Mr. Jackson, a Sena 
tor from Washington, nor Mr. 
Udall, a Representative from 
Arizona, was entered in the 
preferential “beauty contest” in 
Illinois. Mr. Carter’s dominance 
• the preferential contest, 
moreover, failed to translate 
itself into dominance of the 
delegate contests. 

Tabulation of delegate re- 
turns was slow, but it seemed 
likely that many of Illinois’ 369 
votes at the Democratic Na- 
tional. Convention would be 
controlled by Mayor Richard 
J. Daley of Chicago and Sena- 
tor Adlai E. Stevenson 3d. 
Neither is pro-Carter. Mr. Daley

of Dr. Mario E. Jascalevich. 

New Jersey sorgeon, on 
charges of murdering one or 
more patients with curare at 
Riverdell Hospital a decade ago, 
according to law enforcement 
officials. 

Dr. Jascalevich has been re- 
ferred to as ‘‘Dr, X” in The 
Netv York Times, which pub- 
lished on Jan. 7 and S the re- 
sults of its investigation into 
the "suspicious” deaths of nine 
or more patients in 1965 and 
1966 at the small osteopathic 
hospital in Oradell at which 
Dr. Jascalevich was formerly 
chief surgeon. 

However, his name has now 
emerged in the grand jury 
proceedings that began yester- 
day and in legal documents 
that are publicly available. 
In addition, his identity appears 
to be well known in medical 
circles in the state. 

Interview Declined 

Dr. Jascalevich, a 4S-year- 
cild Argentine immigrant who 
practices in West New York, 
has declined to be interviewed 
regarding the case. 

His lawyer, James E. Ander- 
son, reiterated at an unusual 
news conference today that his 
client was innocent of any 
and had "nothing 

'to hide.” 

The lawyer, who bad declined 
to have his own name used 
in this case until today, would 
neither confirm "Yus client's 
identity nor answer specific 
questions relating to Dr. Jas- 
calevich’s use of curare a dec- 
ade ago. 

But he said that “a Roman 
circus spectacle" had been 
created by the publication of 
results of chemical tests on 
five bodies recently exhumed 
in Mr. Woodcock’s new investi- 
gation of the case. 

Curare Found 


In another development to- 
day, a chemist who is perform- 
ing some of those tests for 
Dr. Richard Coumbis, the chief 
toxicologist of New Jersey, said 
that he had found curare in 
the tissues of each of the four 
bodies he had examined so far. 

In an interview with The 
New York Times, the chemist, 
Dr. David P. Beggs of the Hew- 
lett-Packard Company in Avon- 
dale, Pa., said he had detected

billion-doUar state income tax 
bill approved early tin's morn- 
ing by the State Assembly had 
an excellent chance to become 
law. 

The Governor said he would 
sign the measure if it was 
passed by the Senate, which 
may vote on it as early as 
Monday. 

The tax package “creates a 
new era, a modem era of sound 
taxpaying in our state," the 
Governor said, adding that he 
was encouraged that Legisla- 
tors considered the tax to be 
theirs and not his. 

Earlier Defeats Recalled 

The Governor lost a fight 
in the Legislature in 1974 and 
in 1975 for his version of an 
income tax. 

Senator Merlino said he was 
confident that the votes to pass 
the bill in the Senate would 
be there. In the last two years, 
a state income tax was killed 
in the Senate five times after 
passing the Assembly. The 
State Senate is currently in 
recess, but the Senate Pres- 
ident, -Matthew Feldman, who 
is vacationing in Hawaii, had 
promised to reconvene the Sen- 
ate as soon as the Assembly 
had acted on an income tax. 

Governor Byrne raised the 
possibility of still more new 
taxes at a news conference 
today. 

Money Is for Schools _ 

■ Money, from. the. income tax 
is earmarked for public schools 
and for a cut in local property 
taxes, and therefore none of 
it will be available to restore 
cuts in state budgets, including 
those of state colleges,, the 
Governor said. 

Mr. Byrne said, however, that 
he would accept an increase 
in the 5 percent state sales 
tax or the gasoline tax if the 
Legislature passed them. 

The income tax, which passed 
the Assembly by a 43-to-33 
vote, could provide a windfall 
of S10 million or more a year 
for New York State.

U.S., Angry Over Angola , 
T o Delay 3 Soviet Meetings 

By BERNARD GWERTZMAN 

Sptdiil lo Tie Stw Turk tim 

WASHINGTON, March 16 — Because of Soviet military 
involvement in Angola, the United States has decided for 
the time being against participating in Cabinet-level meetings 
of various Sovlet-Americanf 
joint commissions set up in 
recent years when detente 
was -in vtigue. State Depart- 
ment. ofkiais said today. 

There are nine such commis- 
tions, but the decision has so 
far affected only three, dealing 
in trade, housing and energy. 

The other commissions are not' 
due to meet until late in the 
year, and. by then, the United 
States may decide to partici- 
pate, officials said. 

The United States decision 
not to take part in the energy 
commission was first indicated 
late last night by an Admini- 
stration official. 

Robert L. Funseth, the State 
Department spokesman, today 
announced the official decision 
on the commissions, when he 
said that “in light of the situa- 
tion in Angola, we felt we 
could not conduct our business 
with the Soviet Union 
usual.” 

At the very moment when 
the Administration was signal- 
ing its irritation with the Soviet 
Union, 10 Senators, including 
Henry M. Jackson, the Wash- 
ington Democrat, introduced a 
resolution today in the Senate 
supporting efforts to improve 
Soviet-American relations. 

The Administration’s action 
was clearly a limited one and 
not meant to disrupt overall 
Soviet-American relations. 

Secretary of State Henry A. 

Kissinger, testifying before the 
Senate Foreign Relations Com- 
mittee. repeated that the Gov- 
ernment’s anger over Soviet;

WASHINGTON, March 16— 
The Ford Administration is ex- 
pected to unveil later this week 
legislation that its framers said 
would virtually end the prac- 
tice of Federal electronic sur- 
veillance of American citizens 
without a court order. 

This is the first time that 
a Republican .Administration 
has been willing to support 
a bill that would require Feder- 
al officials to get a warrant 
from a judge before instituting 
national security and foreign 
intelligence electronic surveil- 
lance within the United States, 
senior Administration sources 
said today.

LONDON, March 16— Prime 
Minister Harold Wilson an- 
nounced his resignation today, 
stunning his party and the 
nation. 

The resignation will take ef- 
fect as soon as the Labor Party 
members of the House of Com- 
mons have chosen a successor. 
Voting will begin next week. 

Mr. Wilson, a fixture In 
British politics for 30 years —

Excerpts from the Wilson 
statement are on Page 14. 

er. nearly eight of them as Prime 
Minister — informed Queen 
Elizabeth n of his decision early 

today and then told his Cabinet 

iln a statement issued shortly 
before noon from 10 Downing 
Street, he said in part: 

In March 1974 I decided 
that 1 would remain in office 
for no more than two years. I 
have not wavered in this deci- 
sion and it is irrevocable." 

Speculation on Successor 

The decision took the coun-j 
try by complete surprise, and; 
immediately started a round 
of speculation about his suc- 
cessor. The leading candidates 
appear to be James Callaghan, 
the Foreign Secretary, and Den- 
is Healey, Chancellor of the 
Exchequer, with three others 
regarded as somewhat longer 
shots: Roy Jenkins, the Home 
Secretary, Anthony Crosland, 
Secretary of the Environment, 
and Michael Foot, Secretary for 
Employment 

The decision also raised a 
host of questions about Mr. 
Wilson’s motives and his sense 
of timing, since he himself con- 
ceded that he bad chosen to 
leave at a critical juncture in 
his Government's effort to con- 
tain inflation and restore 
health to the nation's economy. 

He had apparently confided 
in very few people. He said 
that in 1974, when he last came 
to office, he had written him- 
self a confidential memoran- 
dum setting last fall’s Labor 
Party conference as the date 
on which be would retire: ha 
amended this in order to direct 
the anti-inflation policy, but on 


cover foreign intelligence-gath- 
ering activities in international 
communications and foreign 
communications conducted by 
the National Security Agency, 
according to Administration 
sources. 

The draft of the bill, which 
is now before President Ford 
for approval, was worked out

White Rhodesians Intent 
On Preserving ‘Easy Life’ 


By HENRY KAMM 

Spedai to The Ne Work Times 


SALISBURY, Rhodesia. March 
16 — ‘ This man Smith has an 
appeal," said Sir Roy Welen- 
sky, who calls himself a "bitter 
opponent” of Prime Minister 
Ian D. Smith's Government, 
it’s the appeal of a very 
easy life." 

"For- 56,000 a year you can 
have five servants, a swim- 
ming pool and the lot," the 
69-year-old Sir Roy, Prime 
Minister of the former Central 
African Federation and the 
eider statesman of Rhodesia, 
continued. 

“That’s the secret this man 
has had: you're going to keep 
what you have " 

The 278.000 white Rhode- 
sians live irr a style and com- 
fort ranging, in American 
terms, from middle-class sub- 

L 


urbia to Westchester County 
estate. There are no visible 
poor whites, no whites in 
menial jobs and it seems un- 
likely that there is a white 
who has one of this country’s 
6.1 million blacks as his 
working superior. 

There appear to be few 
Rhodesians to whom this state 
of affairs does Hot seem 
worth fighting for, although 
those who are considered 
moderates say they consider a 
multiracial society and gov- 
ernment inevitable. But they 
hope, understandably, tha t 
such a government would 
guarantee that in raising the 
black population to equal op- 
portunity it would not lower

WASHINGTON. March 16 — 
President Ford disclosed today 
his finding that imports were 
injuring domestic producers of 
stainless and other "specialty" 
steels, but he held up imposinjg ' 
import quotas for 90 days pend- 
ing an effort to negotiate an 
"orderly marketing agreement" 
with the main foreign supply- 
ing countries. 

The President’s decision was 
the first major one under 
the import-limiting provisions 
of the 1974 Trade AcL Jt fol- 
lowed a hearing, a finding of 
injury and a recommendation 
of import quotas by the Inter- 
national Trade Commission. 

One way or another, import 
restraints on specialty steel 
are now all but certain to be 
imposed, though with a delay. 
Probably more important, the 
President disclosed his decision 
to seek, in current international 
trade negotiations in Geneva, 
special world trade agree- 
ment covering all international 
trade in steel. 

In the case of the United 
States, specialty steel accounts 
for less than 2 percent of im-

i White Rhodesians Intent on Preserving the asy

the standards that white Rho- 
desians now enjoy. 

At a time when Rhodesia is 
under increasing pressure from 
Britain, South Africa and sur- 
rounding black African nations 
to reach some accommodation 
with its black, majority, the 
moderates here are few. - 
The last time Mr. Smith's 
Rhodesian Front Party renewed 
its complete hold over all 50 
white seats in Parliament, only 
about 23,000 voted for opposi- 
tion party candidates. 

Mr. Smith's 50-to-0 majority 
in Parliament exaggerates the 
proportion of his popular sap- 
port, but even opposition pol- 
iticians do not dahn more 
support than their 1974 vote 
showed. 

Political observers divide the 
great majority of whites into 
a significant and vocal wing 
to the right of the government, 
more or less ardent Smith sup- 
porters, those who would -do - 
nothing to rock a boat that is 
affording them 
cruise, and an ineffectual op 
position 

Patriotism Runs High 

Patriotism runs high and is 
enhanced by a heavy propor- 
tion of post-World War n 
immigrants from Britain to 
whom the mounting outside 
pressure on their new home- 
land recalls the grim but 
glorious days of embattled 
Britain standing alone against 
the Axis in full cry. 

The majority of Rhodesians 
seem to have persuaded them- 
selves that in standing up for 
their privileged position they 
are also defending Western 
and Christian civilization 
against Communism. 

A fervent, Bible-belt kind of 
Christianity— fighting against 
Communism, immorality and 
what is perceived here to be a 
decline in Western values — is 
much in evidence and believed 
to be a strong political asset to 
Mr. Smith. 

There is a quick labeling of 
all opposition or unconvention- 
al sentiment as Communism. 
Last week Elsie Thompson of 
Bulawayo, who heads a group 
staging one of the many “Pray 
for Rhodesia" meetings cur- 
rently being held, announced

that she would not invite any 


"Although we have faith in 
God, we are against the church 
as we feel they have definite 
Communist leanings," she 
explained. 

In this atmosphere. Mr. 
Smith's principal opposition 
comes not from the moderates, 
but from the extreme right of 
the Rhodesian Front as well as 
those outside the party. They 
are grouped around a South 
African - based organization 
called the Southern African 
Solidarity conference and a 
monthly newspaper published 
here. Property & Finance. 

The newspaper has an audit- 
ed circulation of 7,000, accord- 
ing to its editor and manag- 
ing director, Wilfred Brooks, 
and an independent survey put 
its readership at 71,000, per- 
haps half of the adult white 
population. 

Property & Finance and 
meetings organized by the 
Solidarity Conference repre- 
sent the principal public op- 
position to Mr. Smith and, ac- 
cording to knowledgeable ob- 
servers, the only opposition 
opinion the Prime Minister 
takes into account.

WASHINGTON, March 16- 
Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger declared today that 
the United States "will do noth- 
ing to help the white minority 
to exercise authority in Rhode- 
sia.” 

His statement before the Sen- 
ate Foreign Relations Commit- 
tee was described by a State 
Department Africa specialist as 
"the strongest" Mr. Kissinger 
has made on American policy 
toward Rhodesia since that 
country’s relations with neigh- 
black African countries have 
worsened in the last three 
weeks. 

On March 4, in testimony 
before the House International 
Relations Committee. Mr. Kis- 
singer declared thaL the Rhode- 
sian white minority Government 
might be facing its "last oppor- 
tunity” to negotiate a peaceful 


transition to majority rule with 
black nationalist leaders. 

However, on that occasion, 
he also warned Cuba to act 
with circumspection with re- 
gard to the Rhodesian situation, 
and this was interpreted by 
some as a possible expression 
of support for the minority 
administration of Ian D. Smith 
in Salisbury. 

One day later, Pieter K. Van 
der Byl. Rhodesia’s Defense and 
Foreign Minister, went on tele- 
vision to say: "J would iika 
to take ibis opportunity of ex- 
pressing my appreciation for 
what the American Secretary 
of State said.” 

A State Department official 
of the Bureau of African Altai rs 
said that Mr. Kissinger's re- 
mark today was intended to 
"clarify" American policy, “to 
make sure Smith doesn’t mis- 
understand the signals.” 


In an — 

Brooks, who considers himself 
an old-fashioned liberal, called 
on Mr. Smith to break off his 
negotiations with Joshua 
Nkomo, black nationalist lead- 
er, on black demands for ma- 
jority rule, and pursue the war 
against nationalist guerillas to 
victory. 

He said Mr. Nkomo and his 
associates should be “put 
back inside, where they be- 
long.” Mr. Smith detained Mr. 
Nkomo in a remote camp for 
11 years. 

“Rhodesia is a white state 
which was created from an ab- 
solute wilderness SO years 
ago," Mr. Brooks declared. 
'The African has no past, very 
little present without white or 
yellow help, and no future of 
his own.” 

More Virulent Terms 

His newspaper reflects sim- 
ilar ideas in more contemptu- 
ous and virulent terms. Mr. 
Brook's low opinion of blacks 
extends to other ethnic groups.; 
Noting that emigration had 
caused some competent people 
to leave, he complained: 

“They have been replaced 
by Portuguese refugees from 
Mozambique. The bulk of the 
Portueuese. are pretty third- 
grade.” 

He requested that a stronger 
term he had employed not bej 
quoted. 

Although published immigra- 
tion statistics show a net gain 
of newcomers over emigrants — 
because of the Portuguese ref- 
ugees — a steady, slow outflow 
is known to be under way. 
Most emigrants are believed to; 
be young professionals. The! 
strict currency export restric- 
tions, as well as difficulties in 
liouidating assets prevent 
others who might otherwise bej 
tempted to leave. ' 

The apprehensions that come! 
out in conversations with Rho-i 
desians do not show on the 
surface of this prosperous 
country. 

"We have had the 10 best 
years of our lives,” Mr. Smith 
said in a television interview. 

The adversity of United Na- 
tions sanctions on trading with 
Rhodesia has put Rhodesia's 
producers and traders on their 
mettle and has worked as a 
spur to rapid and varied indus- 
trial development. 

"’The businessmen have been 
forced by conditions to become 
the best sanction-busters in the 


Except for some luxury im- 
ports, Rhodesians find every- 
thing they need in ample 
variety. They obtain goods 
either from new manufacturing 
plants built since sanctions or 
with the cooperation of trading 
partners throughout the world, 
by circumventing sanctions, or 
by both. Car assembly plants 
produce Renault, Peugeot, Ci- 
troen, B.M.W. and Da t sun cars 
from parts shipped by the 
manufacturers.

Lebanon, military action against him. 
[Page 3.] 

The "Dushka'* referred to 
by the friendly Druse soldier 
in this mountain town is a 
Soviet-designed 13.7-mm. ma- 
chine gun. but in Lebanon 
the name has rubbed off on 
its American cousin, the 50- 
caliber, which American 
soldiers in Vietnam called 
“Mother.” 

The weapon in question 
was a 50-caliber machine gun 
mounted on a Land Rover 
100 yards up the road. In 
the back of the Land Rover 
was an army deserter, his 
head wrapped in a red- 
checked kaffiyeh with a loop 
under the chin against the 
cold. 

"1 am the small soldier 
from this army.” the man 
introduced himself, speaking 
irregular but imaginative En- 
glish. He said the Lebanese 
Arab Army, about the only 
thing left ’ of what used to 
be the Lebanese Army, would 
shortly inarch on the palace 
of President Suleiman Fran- 
jieh, six miles down the road. 

‘■Will fall from the sky 
until down, between ouV 
legs." the soldier said with 
a beaming grin, fluttering 
his arm like a tumbling swal- 
low. ‘'Because there is 15,000 
persons dead — and he killed 
them.” 

His words were approved 
by a gathering crowd of fel- 
low soldiers and towns- 
people, assembled at a bread 
shop. 

"We want to go have cof- 
fee with Suleiman Franjieh,” 
he continued, enjoying his 
humor. "We are like the 
ring,” he added, waving to 
the valley below. "Tell him,' 
tell him he is like the finger 
in the ring.” 

The words are strong, but 
the two columns of the Leb- 
anese Arab Army stopped 
yesterday after threatening 





ingerie this special used to be 

saved for a trousseau. But designer 
Eve Stillman feels that something this 
beautiful is meant to be enjoyed 
each and every day. So she made these 
lovely lace-trimmed designs in a 
very practical non-cling crepe Remarque.®

Some insist there are Syr- 
ians in their midst. 

The Bhamdun column, 
which is now dispersed 
around the town, stopped in 
the middle of Druse country, 
the political turf of Kamal 
Jumblat, the Socialist leader. 

Mr. Jumblat heads one.of 
the most credible private ar- 
mies in Lebanon. The Druse, 
a cohesive, secretive Islamic 
sect, are cordial in peace and 
tough in war. But it seems 
that Mr. Jumblat is not quite 
ready to square off with the 
1.000 clansmen and soldiers 
of the beleaguered President 
said to be gathered at Baab- 
da. the site of the President's 
enclave. 

Baabda looks peaceful 
enough in the shifting layers

jieh, whose resigna- 
imanded last Thurs- 


his own Maronite Catholic 
community. 

The Prune Minister, who in 
Lebanese tradition is a Sunni 
Moslem, would hold power tin 
til the new President was 
chosen from the Maronite com- 
munity, which follows the East- 
ern rite but owes allegiance to 
Rome. 

Mr. Franjieh, according to 
some accounts, was also insist- 
ing that the shattered army be 
reunited, that Parliament ap- 
prove his Feb. 14 declaration 
of political changes and that 
agreements between the Gov- 
ernment and the sprawling 
Palestinian guerrilla movement 
be applied “in letter and spirit. 1 ' 

The Franjieh declaration, 
which was the underpinning of 
the Syrian-sponsored cease-fire, 
promised a greater share of 
power to Lebanon’s Moslem 
majority, while retaining the 
post of chief of state for the 
Maronites. - 

Mr. Franjieh received a 


steady stream of visiters a*. 
Baabda durinc the day. ami 
one of them said afterward that 
the President had a Colt .45 
pistol stuck in his belt. 

As Mr. Franjien sot his con- 
ditions for leaving office— and 
he seemed to tell different peo- 
ple different things — armed 
men assaulted the Ramel Pris- 
on. Beirut's major penal institu- 
tion, and liberated 700 crim- 
inals. 

Sporadic shooting continued 
along Beirut's confrontation 
line between Moslem and Chris- 
tian Arabs and was particular- 
ly heavy in the battered sea- 
frdnt hotel district. In the last 
24 hours, 25 people have been 
killed in clashes, rocket explo- 
sions or by sniper bullets. 


of thick mist and sharp sun- 
shine. No sounds of violence 
could be heard up here, or 
ail the way to the Syrian 
border. 

Mr. Jumblat, like Mr. Fran- 
jieh, seems locked in the 
old chess game of Lebanese 
politics, which in military 
terms translates into. "Don’t 
move unless you absolutely 
have to. Territory is to be 
held, not taken.” 

With this tactic, Mr. Jum- 
blat is winning and Mr. Fran- 
jieh is losing. 

So while Lebanon- awaits 
the outcome of its "soft 
coup," proclaimed five days 
ago by a general who com- 
mands almost no troops, the 
politicians maneuver to find 
Mr. Franjieh a graceful way 
out, and the Lebanese Army 
fritters away its time. 

The Lebanese Arab Army 
does "control" a lot of ter- 
ritory — garrisons in northern 
Lebanon, (he Bekaa Valley, 
(he sensitive Israeli border 
area, (he port towns south 
cf Beirut and at places in the 
capital itself. But it has yet 
to fight a real battle. 

It began on the tumultuous 
day of Jan. 21, when Lieut. 
Ahmed al-Khatib, a 33-year- 
old scion of a Jumblat-ccm- 
nected family from Chhim 


who sports an Afro-stjrie 
hairdo and has a manner 
vaguely evocative of Fidel 
Castro, inarched north from 
positions near the Israeli bor- 
der with 19 men to protest 
pro-Christian bias in the offi- 
cer corps. He picked up 50 
more men and a lot of 
armored vehicles. 

But by the time the Mos- 
lem officer and his follow- 
ers reached Masnaa on the 
Syrian border, the Syrians 
has imposed a cease-fire on 
this splintered nation and, 
as the lieutenant made clear 
in an interview last month 
at his headquarters in the 
Bekaa Valley, he was a frus- 
trated commander. 

But he was a realist, too. 
“It's difficult to make a revo- 
lution in Lebanon,” he said: 
“There's too much money 
around.” Then he hopped in- 
to his camouflaged jeep and 
disappeared amid a snow- 
fall. 

Khatib Not at Headquarters 

Today, back at his muddy 
Qab Elias headquarters, a 
commandeered mansion near 
the Litani River, the lieuten- 
ant was nowhere to be found. 
One of his comrades at the 
commandeered Beirut offi- 
cers Beach Club, the group's 
Beirut headquarters, said he 


was thought to be in Syria, 
talking with the arbiters of 
Lebanon's destiny. 

There was no sign here of 
the Syrian troops that some 
people asserted yesterday had 
poured into the country. It 
was a rice quiet day io the 
country. A deserter guarding 
a crossroads listened to wail- 
ing Arabic music on his tran- 
sistor radio. 

"We are not for war,” said 
the soldier in charge of the 
Qab Elias mansion, who gave 
his name as Abdel Karim. 

At the force's headquarters 
in Beirut, at the foot of the 
exclusive Manara section, a 
private worked on the design 
of the Lebanese Arab Army's 
new insignia and expressed 
hope that the "Syrian troops 
in As Smqa uniforms” would 
stop blocking the troops and 
armor at Khalde. 

Across town. Raymond 
Edde, a moderate Christian 
politician who has aspira- 
tions to succeed Mr. Franjieh, 
observed: 

"It's becoming a vaudeville 
act. The coup d'dtat is not 
serious. The soidiers are not 
serious. The head of state 
is not serious. Nothing is 
serious in my country/' 

The sound of gunfire 
rippled in the background.

Denies C. I. A. Leaked Report on Missing Data 


, WASHINGTON. March 16. intended to say any such thing. 
[ ( AP)— Georg? Bush, Director of, He said he must have said “be- 
l Central Intelligence, denied to- lCause " instead of “the cause," 
day that the Central Intel] i-!meaning that the House intelli- 



gence Agency deliberately 
: leaked a report that the House 
'Select Committee on Intelli- 
gence had lost 332 documents 
so as to make the committee 
lock bad. 

The chairman cf the select 
committee. Representative Otis 
G. Pike. Democrat of Suffolk, 
accused the CXA. and the State 
[Department in a speech before 
jthe House last week of con- 
ducting what he called “a fine 
covert domestic operation" by 
accusing the committee of los- 
ing the documents. 

‘The CJLA. didn't do any 
such thing," Mr. Bush said to- 
day. “nothing of that ‘ nature 
at alL" 

Mr. Bush telephoned a re- 
porter tonight to say that an 
article quoting him as blaming 
Mr. Pike and not the C.LA. for 
causing an uproar over the 
incident was wrong. 

“My whole purpose was to 
i avoid an argument with him." 
'Mr. 3ush said, referring to Mr. 
Pike, "not start an argument 
with him." 

Mr. Bush was understood to 
say in a tapeTecorded comment 
to reporter? that Mr. Pike was 
“the cause of this whole prob- 
lem under greet pressure." 

But Mr. 3ush said he never 


to bo routinely approved ini only 


gence investigation, not the 
public dispute over the 232 
documents, had put Mr. Pike 
under pressure. 

Sped*] to Tbc Sw York Tiroes 

WASHINGTON, March 16— 

Representative John J. Flynt. 
chairman of a House committee 
investigating the leak of a re- 
port hy the House Select Com- 
mitte a on Intelligence, said to- 
day that 300 to 400 persons 
could be questioned in the in- 
quiry and that public hearings 
were probable. 

Mr. Flynt said it was also 
probably that persons would 
be interrogated by his investi- 
gators' not only here and in 
New York, but also in other 
areas of the country and pos- 
sibly overseas. 

The remarks of ths Georgia 
Democrat, who is chairman of 
the House Committee on Stan- 
dards of Official Conduct, com- 
monly known as the house 
ethics committee, were made 
at a hearing of the Accounts 
Subcommittee of the House Ad- 
ministration Committee, which 
is considering. Mr. Fljmfs re- 
quest for 5350,000 to conduct 
the investigation. 

The subcommittee lacked a 
quorum for an official vote oni vestigation itself was “inviting 
the funds, which are expected I the kind of mischief that can 


several days. 

The investigation itself was 
voted by the House last month 
when it directed the ethics 
committee to determine how 
a copv of the report of the 
House Select Committee on In- 
tellieence was made available 
;o the press. 

Mr. Flvnt’s reference to the 
number cf persons who could 
be questioned startled son-? 
members of chs subcommittee. 

Representative Mendel J. Da- 
vis. Democrat of South Caroli- 
na. asked Mr. Flynt if he 
thought the investigation could 
be ended by next July 31, as 
the chairman had noted :n a 
letter to the subcommittee. 

“I hope so,” Mr. Flynt replied, 
“but until the first question 
is put to the firs: witness, 
no one can predict how long 
it v.'ill last.” 

Mr. Burton persisted, asking, 
‘Trawl outside . the United 
States? 

‘It’s conceivable,” Mr. Flynt 
replied 

The amount of money sought 
by the ethics committee was 
called “outrageous" by another 
witness before the subcommit- 
tee, Representative Michael J. 
Harrington, Democrat oF Massa- 
chusetts. 

Mr. Harrington said the in- 


cuardian of individual liber fceS 
while distracting us from the 
real chore of reforming toe in- 
telligence bureaucracy-' 

Representative Frank Thomp- 
son Jr., the New Jersey Demo- 
crat who is chairman of the 
Accounts Subcommittee, no.ee 
that the House would have to 
nrcv'de counsel to those Pf r ‘ 
*cns Questioned by the ethics 
committee who chose net to 
festifv voluntarily. He asked 
whether the 5350,000 would 
pay such expenses. 

Mr. Flynt replied that such 
payments might not be neces- 
sary. depending an how the 
investigation preceded, but that 
if they were his committee 
might have to ask for yet more 
hinds.

White House Sa id to Favor Ending Warrantless Taps ofCitk 




Continued From Page I, CoL T 

in six months of negotiations! 
between members of the Senate 1 
Judiciary Committee led by 
Senator Edward ML Kennedy. 
Massachusetts Democrat, and' 
Attorney General Edward H. 
Levi . 

If a coalition of liberals, In- 
cluding Senators Kennedy and 
Gaylord Nelson, also an ac- 
knowledged expert on electron-! 
1c surveillance egislation, were; 
to support the bill, its cbances 
of passage would be assured,' 
according to veteran Congres- 
sional sources. 

Mr. Kennedy said in an inter-, 
view that he found the draft 
now completed by the Justice 
Department to be a "construc- 
tive piece of legislation.'’ Mr. 
Nelson, a Wisconsin Democrat, 
said In an interview that he 
found the draft “a substan- 
tial improvement over current 
practice.” 

Senators Kennedy and Nelson I 
were joint authors of a bill 
last year to ban warrantless 
electronic surveillance. That 
proposal was frozen in the Sen- 
ate Judiciary Committee be- 
cause it did not command the 
support of conservative Demo- 
crats and Republicans. 

According to Congressional 
sources, Mr. Levi has mar- 
shaled. support for the Pres- 
ident’s legislation among these 
elements and the Administra- 
tion’s proposal will have con- 
servative support 

Not Curbing President 

The legislation does not pur- 
port to attempt to end a Pres- 
ident’s constitutional power to 
order electronic surveillance to 
save the nation. Congressional 
and Administration sources say 
that only the Supreme Court 
can rule against a President 
using his constitutional powers. 

But Administration sources 
assert that the bill severely 
limits "for all practical purpo- 
ses” the power of a President 
or an Attorney General to ig- 
nore the warrant procedure and 
simply order electronic surveil- 
lance in these areas. 

Nevertheless, Senator Nelson 
and several ether Congression- 


al sources said this and certain 
areas of language and descrip- 
tion gave them, as one put 
it, “concern” and that these 
would have to be ironed out 
in hearings. 

The following are the key 
elements of the proposal, ac- 
cording to sources who worked 
on it: 

qThe bill would cover electro- 
nic surveillance within the 
United 5tates to protect nation- 
al security or obtain intel- 
ligence vital to the conduct 
of the nation’s foreign affairs. 

<JThe bill, in effect, sets out 
what are to be considered ac- 
ceptable targets for electronic 
surveillance in these fields. A 
target could be either an Amer- 
ican, a foreigner or a resident 
alien who is working for a 
foreign power. This is not 
aimed at "benign” represents 
tion of a foreign government— 
for instance, registered foreign 
agents of a government. The 
target would have to be en- 
gaged in sabotage, terrorist ac- 
tivities or "clandestine intel- 
ligence activities,” the draft 
said. 

QOnce the Government agen- 
cy — for example, the Central 
Intelligence Agency or the 
N.SA. — established an Individ- 
ual or facility it wanted to 
target, it would have to prepare 
a sworn certification setting 
out the national security or 
foreign affairs need for the 
information and establishing 
that the target met the criteria 
set down in the law. The certifi- 
cation would have to be signed 
and sworn to by someone of 
Presidential appointee rank. 

4It would take this certifica- 
tion before a. Federal judge 
and ask for a court order to 
conduct the surveillance. Tht 
order could not be sought from 
just any Federal judge but only 
from one of a panel of seven 
judges who would be appointed 
to this work by the Chief Jus- 
tict of the United States. 

flThe order would be good 
for only 90 days and would 
have to be renewed at the 
end of that time. Unlike court- 
ordered surveillance in domes- 
tic criminal casts, there is noi 


requirement that the agency 
ever notify the victim of the 

surveillance. , . 

Several sources- who had seem 
the draft said they were eager, 
that a number of points he | 
clarified. One is a clear defini-1 
tion of “clandestine intelligence' 


activities.” Another is a provi- 
sion of some sort of P rD “22? 
so that agencies 
val could not get their warrants 
from the most sympathetic of 
seven Federal judges.

eral sources, is expected to

Political Violators 



Sped*! Lo The New York: TUm 

SEOUL, South Korea, March; 
116— The South Korean Govern-! 
Iment will prosecute all who 
I participate fn political activities; 
j that are banned under the cur-: 
rent emergency decree, the 
(Prime Minister, Choi Kyu Hah, 

; told a National Assembly ses- 
i sion today. 

| Answering a question from 
j the floor by an opposition legis- 
; later, he declared that the pre- 
viously arrested political and 
I religious leaders would be 
["dealt with according to law” 

; because they had allegedly used 
'religious ceremonies for illegal 
'political purposes. 

Eleven Government critics, 
[led by the former opposition 
• presidential candidate, Kim Dae 
Jung, were arrested two weeks 
ago after signing a statement 


criticizing the Government and 
as king President Park Chung 
Hee to resign. 

Nine others, including former 
President Yun Po Sun, are be- 
ing investigated without deten- 

An opposition demand to I 
have an independent pariia- I 
mentary committee investigate | 
the arrests was rejected by | 
Government supporters within _ 
the Assembly. The refusal was ■ 
based on a contention that any ■ 
jAssembly initiative would I 
prejudice ongoing investiga- | 
tions. 1

THE NEW YORK TIMES. WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17. 1975 


Wilson , Stunning Britain , 
Quits 


s as °rime 


•'* Continued From Page 1, CoL 8, Mai '8 aret Catcher, the Conser- 

ivative leader. Into power in 

'■ Dec. 9 he informed the Queen [a general election. 
i.- — the only person he publicly' 


. admitted to having shared his 
; - confidence with — that he would 
depart this month. 

“5 ■ Mr. Wilson offered four rea- 
" sons for wanting to leave, all 
--of which turned one way or 
■T-- the other on his belief that he 
" " had held the office long enough 
and that others should be given 
chance. 


But Mr. Wilson seemed in 
no great danger of having such 
an election forced on him; his 
working majority in Parliament 
— composed of Labor's 318 
members, plus support from 
some liberals, Scottish and 
Welsh nationalists, and Mem- 
bers of Parliament from North- 
ern Ireland — has been holding 


He mentioned first his longj Reaction among ordinary 
service as Prime Minister — 'Britons was difficult to gauge. 


Monger than that of any of my 
peacetime predecessors in this 
century" — and his additional 
service as party leader and. in 
Cabinet posts. Second, he said, 
he saw a "clear duty" not to 
remain while "others are denied 
the chance.” 

Third — and herein crept at 
least some political calculation 
— Mr. Wilson said that he 
should give his successor! 
enough time to establish his 
own style and authority “for 
the remaining years of this 
Parliament-” Unless the Gov- 
ernment is defeated in a major 
vote of no-confidence, or a 
national crisis occurs, Mr. Wil- 
son's successor could conceiv- 
ably remain in office until the 
next general election is re- 
quired by law in 1979. 

Finally, Mr. Wilson conceded 
in so many words that a fresh 
point of view might be useful 
and that he might simply have 
grown a bit stale in the job. 

“There is a danger to which 
I have been alerted all my 
working life,” he said. "It is 
that, in times of rapid change, 
you may be faced with a deci- 
sion which, perhaps in differ- 
ent conditions, you have faced 
before.” He went on to say 
that there might be a tendency 
to make the same choices one 
made the first time around, 
without giving them “the fresh 
consideration the circumstances 
may require." 

Few Changes Expected 

Mr. Wilson emphasized at a 
news conference this afternoon 
that he did not expect his suc- 
cessor to adopt radical changes 
in policy — especially on eco- 
nomic issues-4>ut to carry out 
the present policies with re- 
newed vigor. 

On the whole, the first in- 
stinct among Members OF Par- 
liament and the press was to 
take Mr. Wilson’s explanation 
at face value, if only because 
there were so few other ex- 
planations available. 

He appeared in good health 
at the news conference, joking 
with journalists he has quar- 
reled with so often in the past 
arid asserting that *T am as 
fit now as I was 20 years 
ago, and carrying rather less 
weight." He said he knew how 
“solicitous my friends in the 
press can be," but warned them 
not to take his resignation as 
proof that he had suddenly 
developed a major ailment, 
such as "lung cancer or cancer 
in less mentionable parts of 
my anatomy." 

Mr. Wilson also said he was 
not leaving politics, but would 
continue to represent his home 
constituency in parliament and 
stand again for election if nec- 
essary. 

Victoxy in the Commons 

Politically, he had also 
seemed to be on solid ground. 
He took a battering in the 
Commons last week when the 
left wing of his party, by ab- 
staining, helped the Conserva- 
tives win a resolution criticiz- 
ing, the Government’s econom- 
ic policies. But the next night, 
in a general vote of confidence, 
the dissidents returned to the 
fold and handed Mr. Wilson 
a solid victory on what also 
happened to be his 60th birth- 
day. 

His party had not done well 
in three recent by-elections — in 


Most seemed too surprised to 
register one. Laborites of most 
political hues, including union 
leaders, gave Mr. Wilson high 
marks on his political career, 
although this was to be expect- 
ed. Same busihess and financial 
leaders, pleased with Mr. Wil- 
son's recent economic policies, 
wondered wbether his succes- 
sor could or would sustain 
them. 

A few Conservatives seized 
on Mr. Wilson's departure as 
proof that his party was failing 
apart Kenneth Warren, a Con- 
servative Member of Parlia- 
ment from Hastings, said that 
Mr. Wilson bad deserted the 
ship and that “without a cap- 
tain, the boat must now begin 
to sink and it will be interest- 
ing to see who now claims 
the right to man the lifeboat." 

When Mr. Wilson appeared 
in Parliament for the usuai 
afternoon question period, he 
was greeted with cheers and a 
compliment from Mrs. Thatch- 
er, who said that “in spite 
of the political battles we wish 
you well in your retirement." 
But she could not resist assert- 
ing that the country was stiU 
suffering from "great financial 
difficulty” and that the best 
way to “resoive the uncertain- 
ty’^ would be to “put the matter 
to the people for their vote.” 

Mr. Wilson said in reply that 
he flatly rejected the assertion 
that the economy was not 
showing improvement and that 
an election was required to 
set things right. 

In truth. Mr. Wilson's eco- 
nomic policies of holding the 
line on wages, cutting spending 
plans, and redirecting govern- 
ment revenue to productive in- 
dustry appear to have won 
broad accentance and have 
tpven the Conservatives very 
little to complain about. But 
the very success of these poli- 
cies raised one of today’s most 
interesting questions: Why did 
Mr. Wilson leave in midstream? 

As Mr. Wilson himself put 
it near the end of his statement, 
Britain is at "the turn of the 
hinge” in its effort to restore 
balance and vigor to Che econo- 
my. And Mr. Wilson himself 
had been instrumental in as 
sembling the informal team of 
Mr. Healey, Mr. Foot, the Prime 
Minister, and Jack Jones the 
head of the powerful Transport 
and General Workers Union, 
that devised, sold, and is man- 
aging the new economic strate- 
gy- 

Mr. Wilson's own explanation 
as to why he is leaving while 
the “hinge” is turning was that 
there was now a lull between 
public acceptance of the 1975 
counterinflation strategy and 
the introduction of the new 
budget, which will set forth 
this year's strategy. According- 
ly. he suggested, it would be 
best to resign now and give 
whoever succeeds him full re- 
sponsibility for charting "the 
next phase.” 

Mr. Wilson pledged that as a 
former Prime Minister he would 
not meddle in his successor’s 
affairs. “Once I leave, I leave," 
he said. “Z am not going to 
speak to the man on the 
bridge, and I am not going to 
spit on the deck.” 

There was some friendly 
skepticism about this among 
people who have watched Mr. 
Wilson during his ambitious 
and aggressive political career, 



The leading candidates to sncceed Harold Wilson as Prime Minister 


son committee of the Labor 
Party met tonight to set a 
timetable fcr the election 
procedure. 

Mr. Wiison. who was born 
March 11. 1916, seemed to go 
out of his way in the statement 
to say that he did not regard 
a man's age as a factor, even 
though he himself had judged 
it proper to retire at 60. This 
seemed a dear bint to his 
colleagues not to prejudice Mr. 
Callaghan, the Foreign Secreta- 
ry. who will be 64 next week.

Parliament in Britain 
Allows Radio Coverage 

LONDON, ~Msrch 16 (Reu- 
ters) — The British Parliament 
finally agreed tonight to al- 
low regular live radio trans- 
mission of its sessions. 

The decision, approved In 
the House of Lords without 
a vote and in Commons by a 
vote of 299 to 124, followed 
a four-week radio experiment

It has happened twice before 
on the Conservative side in 
recent years. In 1957, Anthony 
Eden resigned and the Queen — 
after consulting Sir Anthony 
and other party leaders— chose 
Harold Macmillan to succeed 
him. When Mr. Macmillan re 
signed in 1963, he recommend 
ed Alec Douglas-Home and the 
Queen chose him. 

The Conservatives until re- 
cently have tended to leave 
the choice of party leader to 
an informal process under 
which the outgoing leader has 
great individual influence. The 
Labor Party, by - contrast, 
choose-s its leader in a more 
formal process involving votin, 
among Labor Members of the 
Commons.

The London stock market 
which has been enjoying an 
even greater boom than the 
one on Wall Street, in part be- 
cause of the shift in Govern-

points before recovering a

which dropped below the S2

time, lost nearly a point today

mists have criticized Mr. Wil- 
son's handling of the pound 
over che last 12 years. 

In that period, the pound 
has fallen in value from 52.78 
to its current level, a drop 
of 31 pereenL Unemployment 
was 1.6 percent at the begin- 
ning of Mr. Wilson's first term, 
and now it stands at a 30-year 
high of 5J2 percent. 

The inflation rate then drifted 
between 2 and 4 percent. The 
country had a balance of pay- 
ments deficit in 1964 as it 
does now% but under Mr. Wilson 
it has run 10 times higher 
than in 1964. 

Public spending, the hottest 
political and economic issue 
in Britain until today’s resigna- 
tion announcement, has soared 
to S54 billion annually, or 60 
percent of the country’s gross 
national product. It was about 
45 percent 12 years ago. 

A month ago, the Government 
announced that it would stop 
the inflationary growth, ana 
the decision so rattled the left 
wing of the Labor Party that 
it and the Conservatives hand- 
ed Mr. Wilson a resounding 
defeat an the issue last week. 
But his stand was also one

Excerpts of Wilson Remark 


» 


LONDON. March 16 (A£>— 
Following are excerpts fjam 
the statement issued by Har- 
old Wilson today on his res- 
ignation as Prime Minister of 
Britain, 

in March 1974 I decided 
that I would remain in office 
for no more than two years. 
I have not wavered in this 
decision and it is irrevocable. 
Indeed. I had originally in- 
tended that it should take 
effect last September, but 
decided to defer it because 
of the paramount importance 
of ens uring tiie national ac- 
ceptance and success of the 
counterinflation policy the 
Government announced last 
July. 

1 must, of course, inform 
my colleagues of my reasons. 

First, I have been leader 
of this party for over 13 
exciting and turbulent years 
— nearly eight of them in 
government; My period as 
prime minister has been long- 
er than that of any of my 
peacetime predecessors in 
this century. 

. These years of office span- 
ned a period when Britain, 
nationally and international- 
ly, had to face storms and 
challenges without parallel 
in our peacetime history. 

But it is not only those 
last 13 years. In 31 years 
in Parliament I have been 
on one or other front bench 
nearly 30 years — for almost 
11% years in cabinet No 
one should ask for more. 

To have led four adminis- 
trations, dedicated not only 
to solving the nation’s eco- 
nomic problems but also to 
achieving a higher level of 
social justice and equality 
than our people have ever 
known is a privilege con- 
ferred on very few men. 

‘A Clear Duty* 

Second I have a clear duty 
to the country and to the 
party not to remain here 
so long that others are de- 
nied the chance to seek elec- 
tion to this post. 

This is the most experi- 
enced and talented team in 
this century, in my view tran- 
scending that of Campbell- 
Bannerman 70 years ago. 

I am proud of that A 
leadership election will do 
good in showing the country 
the wealth of talent in our 
ranks. I began early. 

The fact that I am leaving 
shortly after my 60th birth- 
day bas no bearing on the 
choice to be made. 

I have reached 60 after 
13 years party leadership, 
nearly eight of these in 
Downing Street. 

• sdme of my most distin- 
guished predecessors were 
either just below or just over 
that age on becoming prime 
minister, including Clem Att- 
lee. Winston Churchill, Har- 
old MacraUJan and Alec 
Douglas-Home in our own 

time. . , 

The fact that I began early 
and have borne the responsi- 
bility of this office for so 
long means that 60 is the 
right age for me to promul- 
gate a change. . 

Third, it is my view that 
my successor should be in 
post now, to impose his or 
her style and to work out 
the strategy for the remain- 
ing vears of this Parliament 

But I am certain that the 
new administration ■will as- 
sert the same determination 
and dedication in our coun- 
ter-inflation policies in this 
country as we have unitedly 
shown to the world. 

Equally, I am totally con- 
vinced that no conceivable 
reconstruction of the cabinet 
could in any way lead to 
a weakening in our resolve 
to fulfill in full measure our 
commitment to our allies and 
partners overseas. 

Fourth, there is a danger 
to which I have been alerted 
all my working life. 

It is that, in times of rapid 
change, you may be faced 
with a decision which, per- 
haps in different conditions, 
you have faced before. 

If, on the earlier occasion 
you considered and rejected 
a particular course of action, 
there is a tendency to say 
you have been into that, so 
that you do not give the 
fresh consideration the cir- 
cumstances may require. 

I am determined not to 
succumb to this danger. 

A Total Explanation* 

I want to make it quite 
clear, with the agreement 
of all ray cabinet colleagues, 
that these reasons represent 
the total explanation of my 
decision. 

There are no impending 
problems or difficulties — eco- 
nomic or political — known to 
the cabinet which are not 
known to the country and 
which are not already the 
subject of the political dis- 
cussions of our times. 

Now I want to express 
my warm thanks to my col- 
leagues, not only for their 
work and achievements, but 
for the fact that in all my 
four administrations these 
have been happy cabinets. 

Now for the future. 

Later this morning 1 wifi 
meet the chairman of the 
parliamentary Labor Party 
and propose that he calls 
a special meeting of the par- 
ty this evening to put forward 
the liaison committee's sug- 
gestions for the leadership 
election so that nominations 
may be invited forthwith. 

I would hope that they 
may be able to devise proce- 
dures which enable full con- 
sideration to be combined 
with ail reasonable speed — 
certainly more expeditious 
than the somewhat leisurely 
weekly procedures of the 
past. 

I shall play no part in 
that election apart from cast- 


ing my own v ' 0Ie ^ secret 
ballot nor will I seek to 
Influence a single member 
of the party in his vote. 

I shall remain in Parliament 
as long as my constituency 
will put up with me. Ijjfve 
net been inaenve on behalf 
of my constituents. I nope 
to see more of them and 
put in more time on their 
behalf. 

*1 Love Parliament* 

I am above all a parliamen- 
tarian. I love Parliament and 
want to go on serving it 

and serving in it 

I shall not go into industry 
or take paid employment 

I shall not accept the head- 
ship or other office in any 
place of learning apart from 
my present relationship with 
the University of Bradford. 

I may give occasional lec- 
tures here or abroad, as I 
have for many years, but 
not to the detriment of my 
parliamentary work. 

I want to say this to my 
successor, whoever he or she 
may be. This is an office 
to cherish: stimulating and 
satisfying. You will never 
have a dull moment, you 
will never get bored. But 
it is a full-time calling. These 
are not the easy, spacious, 
socially, oriented days of 
some of my predecessors. 

Apart from quite generous 
holidays — when thanks to 
modem communications I 
have never been more tban 
moments away from Down- 
ing Street — I have had to 
work seven days a week at 
least 12 to 14 hours a day. 

The Variety and Interest’ 

But the variety and interest 
— with usually at least 500 
different documents or sub- 
missions to read in an aver- 
age weekend after a busy 
week — means that you do 
□ot get bored; consequently 
you do not get tired. 

Every prime minister has 
his own style. But he most 
know all that is going on. 
Even if he were tempted to 
be remiss in this, the wide 
open nature of prime minis- 
ters’ questions — entirely dif- 
ferent from that of any de- 
partmental minister — re- 
quired familiarity with, and 
understanding of, the prob- 
lems oF every department 
and every part of the coun- 
try. 

More than that, the price 
of an administration's contin- 
uance and success is eternal 
vigilance— on duty or on call 
every minute of the day. 
Yet you must find time 
enough to stand back and 
think about the problems of 
the administration, its pur- 
pose, its co-ordination and 
its long-term strategy. 

Equally you have to watch 
for that cloud no bigger than 
a man's hand which may 
threaten not tomorrow’s cri- 
sis but perhaps next months 
or next year’s. In all this 
you have got to think and 
feel politically as well as 
in constitutional and admin- 
istrative terms. 

It is not only the job here 
in Westminster, Whitehall 
and Parliament. It is the job 
in the country. The leader 
of the party and no less 
the prime minister, has a 
duty to meet the people, to 
address political and other 
meetings. 

For 13 years I have aver- 
aged well over 100 a year, 
covering nearly every con- 
stituency, some of them many 
times. 

You will be able to count 
on my full support, especially 
when the going is rough. 
My advice and experience 
is available when you seek 
it: I do not intend to offer 
gratuitous advice. 

*1 Will Give Any Help* 

I will give any help I can 
in any form you ask, inside 
the house, inside the parlia- 
mentary party and in the 
country apart from accepting 
a ministerial appointment. 

In particular I shall be 
guided by the letter and spir- 
it of the undertaking which 


a pre-war 
when he stood 5 
successor who**!* 

chosen— not elected f- 

rule-"once.i leave

I will, of course, ren»u 
full charge ofthe a £S

cess is completed, esos 
ail the rights and *5,

action that is needed. ■- 

I am confident that a 
prime minister in taking 
will enjoy from hista 
the same loyalty, jw. 
understanding and \ 
when required, forgi* 
that it has been my prh 
to enjoy. 

My only advice to 
and the cabinet he for 
and I am sure this a 
is not necessary — is t< 
out into the country,-, 
the people, tell them, es 
to them, listen to then 
above all remember the •

not tbe Palace of Wes 
ster. not Smith Square. 

In return I would as 
party everywhere — : 
hope that our press fr 
all of whom I forgive, 
allow me to say this to 
as well — that in all ci 
stances all concerned 
comply with the spa 
petition to the Queen c 
half of. the Commons 
a new Parliament r 
‘That the most favoi 
construction may be \ 
on all your proceedings. 

The Matter of Timir 

This is not related t 
recent events. 

In July, 1974, I ser 
in writing in a confid 
statement “party eonft 
1975” as my preferred 
This had to be aban- 
because of the camps 
had mounted for accep 
of the counter-inflation 
cy and in particular th 
policy set for the year 
the end of July, 1975. 

I then planned to 
this action in late Dece 
But to drive it right 
Christmas would hav 
volved the problem of 
Iv long recess when th» 
liamentary Labour 
would not be gat 
together at Westminster 

In the event, I info 
Her Majesty the Quee 
December 9 that it ■ 
be middle or late Marcf 
special audience this me 
for this purpose wat 
ranged some weeks a 
also informed the spi 
then deputy speaker, c 
intention to go in fc 

Of the consider? 
which led me to con 
that this timing was' 
I would emphasize the 
lowing. 

The counter-inflation 
cy I announced on Jul 
last year has been fullj 
cepted by all concerned 
deed by "the whole cou 
and all* pay settlements 
then, together with v 
councils and other at 
have fully conformed 
it. 

We are now thereto* 
the turn of the hinge * 
the 1975 policy is fully * 
lished and the 1976 o 
is about to be worked 

The weeks that follm 
be a crucial time in ham 
ing out the next phase o 
anti-inflation policy. " 
will be times of intense 
cussion leading to a dec 
later in the spring. There 
be a time of great puW* 
bate here and in an al' 
constant succession of t 
conferences all over 
country. 

It would have been 
to have timed my actio 
such a wav as to ( 
break in the continuiQ 
this process. 


Polyansky Replaced in Moscc 
As the Minister of Agriculh 


MOSCOW, March 16 — Dmitri 
S. Polyansky, who was dropped 
from the ruling Soviet Politboro 
earlier this year in connection 
with last year’s grain failure, 
has been replaced as Minister 
of Agriculture. 

His dismissal, which was 
briefly announced today by the 
official press agency Tass, 
marks the apparent conclusion 
of a once-promising career that 
had seemed likely to carry Mr. 
Polyansky to the top ranks 
of the Kremlin leadership. Mr. 
Polyansky's removal was gen- 
erally expected after he lost 
his seat as a full member of 
the Politboro at the end of 
the recent 25th Soviet Commu- 
nist Party Congress. 

He is being replaced at the 
| head of the agricultural 
bureaucracy by Valentin K. Me- 
syats, who was second secreta- 
ry oF the Central Asian reoublic 
of Kazakhstan. A relatively un- 
known figure politically, Mr. 
Mesyats, at 43. is 10* years 
younger than his predecessor. 

Unlike Mr. Polyanskv, who 
came down a step when he 
was moved from a Deputy So- 
viet Prime Minister to Minister 
Of Agriculture in 1972. Mr. Me- 
S ^ at ?-_. appears t0 conie from 
a solid agriculture background. 
He was educated at the Mos- 
cow Agricultural Academy and 
served as a Deputy Minister 
« A fr ,cu,ture the Russian 
Republic from 19133 to 1971. 


By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

Special to Tlie Tie! Times 


His more recent respon 
ties as a party secretary, 
included the vast Virgin 
region in Kazakhstan, ' 
was opened up to boost . 
grain production. Mr. 
syats has also been a full 
ber of the party’s Central 
mittee. 

Tass reported that Mj 
Jyansky was being transi 
to another job but g*' 1 
details. There has been sp 
tion here that he 
designated an ambas 
since he was allowed W 1 
his seat in the Central Cffl 
tee.

funds, and asked him how 
much work he had done at 
10 Downing Street, Mr. Wil- 
son replied: "There has been 
a coat hook put up behind 
the bedroom door. The Tory 
election posters that disfig- 
ured the dining roam have 
been taken down, and the 
wall has been cleaned up. 
But there was no cost to 
the taxpayer because it was 
a labor of love.” 

Another reason for his suc- 
cess, however, stemmed from 
the plainness of his style. 
He had no public school 
stammer, no literary allu- 
sions, no upper*class preten- 
sions. His speech was reso- 
lutely middle-class. He be- 
longed to no clubs, hardly 
invited people to dinner 
("why should I entertain if 
I don’t enjoy it?") 

Even his admirers de- 
scribed him as a Philistine, 
almost a compulsive one. His 
wife once joked publicly 
about his lavish use of HP 
sauce, a thick, gooey product 
that makes gourmets shud- 
der. Asked about his reading, 
he said he enjoyed Dorothy 
Sayeris “The Nine Tailors 
and had read it 15 or 20 
times. Another time, he said 
he bad been to see “Swan 
Lake” in Moscow 17 times. 

Private Eye, the satiric mag- 
azine, runs an add weekly 
column called “Mrs. Wilson's 
Diary" that details a lower 
middle-class life at 10 Down- 
ing Street. One example, 
from an account of a Cabinet 
lunch: “We had prepared two 
Urge caldrons of savory mut- 
ton hash and two jumbo- 
sized syrup puddings kindly 
supplied by the London 
Co-op." 

Yet despite his simple style 
—perhaps because of it — as 
well as his Warred ideology, 
Mr, Wilson managed to hold 
a fractious party together 
and give it the stmt, in 1964, 
of the vital experience it 
had not had for 13 years — 
the responsibility for govern- 
ing. 

Clearly Mr. Wilson was 
a shrewd, manipulative, even 
brilliant politician. An Ameri- 
can columnist compared him 
to a Russian nesting doll: 

No matter how much you 
peel off, there is nothing 
to see but politician. 

Leo Abse, a Labor Member 
of Parliament, once wrote: 
“At Westminster almost all 
the members are ambitious 
men: but none has been more 
ambitious than Harold Wil- 
son." 

Mr. Wilson was born on 
March II. 1916, in the Colne 
Valley of Yorkshire, a land 
of bitter poverty and radical 
politics. His father, Herbert, 
was a middle-class industrial 
.chemist and Mfelong radical. 
“Blame me for his politics,” 
said the - elder.. Wilson, who 
died in 1971. 

- As a youth, Harold Wilson 
was. known to be bookish 
and scholarly, with an 
"amazing memory” for facts 
and figures that carried over 
in later years. Mr. Wilson 
himself tells of the time that 
the late Aneurin Bevan, La- 
bor’s colorful Welsh maver- 
ick, asked him what his son 
was going to study at Ox- 
ford. 

"Pure, mathematics,” Mr. 
Wilson replied. 

"Just like his father,” Mr. 
Bevan said. "All facts and 
no bloody vision!" 

Harold Wilson won a his- 
tory scholarship to Oxford 
but switched, after consult- 
ing with his father, to study- 
ing philosophy, politics and 
economics. He won a first- 
class degree, one of the high- 
est ever recorded at. Oxford, 
after scoring the equivalent 
of 17 A’s in IB exams. His 
own tutor gave him a B 
lus. On graduation he brief- 
taught economics at Ox-

ilL He. represented Ormskirk, 
near Liverpool. Two years 
later, , when he was 31, he 
became the youngest Cabinet 
member in a century, being

of Trade.

with the party's ■ left wing, 
-and in 1960 challenged a 
pofiticafly weakened Hugh 

■■Gaitskefl for tbe leadership 

Mr. Wilson lost, butinKeS, 
after Mr. : GaitskeH’s death, 
he' beat George' Brown, who' 
was supported by the trade, 
unions, and became the par- 
ty’s leader: 

The Ltoor Party victory 
in the general election of 
1964 that made Mr. Wilson 

- Prime Minister, was viewed, 
as ope n i ng a .new era in 

. British politics and effective- 
ly ending " the. dasstbonnd* 
patrician reign of sucii Con-, 
servative figures as Harold 
Macrmllan and Sir Alec 
Douglas. Home.-. 

• Mr. Wilson first entered' 
Downing Street as.lmad-pf 
a Government with a majdri-. 
tjr of only .five. He chose 
his Government with a care- 
ful balance, and promoted - 
such left-wingers then as 
Barbara -Castle, Anthony 
Wedgwood-Benn, and Rich- 
ard.Crossman. ... 

He made three key. deci- 
sions that spurted his popu- 
larity, but proved to have un- 
certain consequences. He re- 
jected afi arguments for de- 
valuation, he stuck to. the 
east of Suez . policy— the • 
maintenance, of .Britidi troops 
in the ' Far East — ‘ and 
in 1965, proclaimed that 
he would . never - use force 


against white Rhodesians. He 
said then that economic 
sanctions would bring down 
Bui Smith's white rebel re- 
gime “in weeks rather than 
months.” a comment that Mr. 
Wilson has ample cause to 
regret. 

By T966, Mr. Wilson pre- 
sented Labor as the natural 
ruling party and he called 
and won a general election 
with a majority of 100. 

Policies Are Reversed 

In the next four years Mr. 
Wilson reversed most of his 
previous policies: he came 
into conflict with trade 
unions, the pound was deval- 
ued, the British presence be- 
gan to be withdrawn from 
the Far East, employment 
began rising.- He called a 
general election in June, 
1970, and was defeated by 
Mr. Heath. Four years later 
Mr. Wilson succeeded in 
reaching Downing Street 
again, first with a minority 
Government and, in a second 
general election, with a slim 
majority. 

“He was a master, ' not 
of long-term planning and 
organization, but of short- 
term Options and brilliant 
improvisation,” Anthony 
Sampson, the journalist, has 
written. 

' By all accounts, Mr. Wilson 
■ — who married the former 
Mary Baldwin in 1940 and 
has two sons, Robin and 
Giles — has remained a pri- 
vate, e nigmatic and quite 
unpredictable figure through 
his years as Prime Minister. 

A British newspaper pub- 
lisher has said that “under- 
neath a rather cocky exterior 
is a man with no real self- 
confidnce." 

What has motivated him, 
what drives him, has always 
been a source of puzzlement 
“When he comes home after 
a bad day, I say why don't 
you go back to Oxford," his 
wife, Mary, has said. '1 lie 
awake worrying, but he can 
go right to sleep." 


Minister Harold Wilson's resig- 
nation notice today came as 3 
puzzling and unsettling sur^ 
prise to other Western Eu 
rope an capitals. 

In almost every European) 
country except West Germany, 
there is an atmosphere of po- 
litical uncertainty and malaise. 
Even in Bonn there is the possi- 
bility of a change of govern- 
ment after next Octobers elec- 
tions. 

Mr. Wilson’s unexpected an- 
nouncement added to the gen- 
eral anxiety, though he has not 
been either widely respected 
or particularly popular in the 
other Western European coun- 
tries. 

There was criticism here of 
his timing, since bis announce 
raent came amid a European 
monetary crisis provoked by 
the weakness of the British 
pound and the French fran 
and by investors’ worries about 
recent electoral gains by the 
Communists in Italy and 
France- 

Italian and West German 
leaders had struggled to get 
Mr. Wilson and his Labor Party 
to agree first to British mem 
bership in the Common Market 
and then to go on to advance 
toward European political 
union. 

Hopes for a S ummi t 

They had hoped to take a 
major step forward at a Com- 
mon Market summit meeting 
in Luxembourg next month — a 
decision to hold direct elections 
to the European Parliament in 
1978. 

In Luxembourg today, an 
jaide to Prime Minister Gaston 
Thorn said he expected that 
the nine-nation meeting of the 
Common Market’s European 
Council would take place as 
expected April 1 and 2, with 
Mr. Wilson or with his succes- 
sor. 

But in Bonn, a West German 
official said, "Whether the Eu- 
ropean Parii ament decision can 
be taken now is something else 
again." 

Mr. Wilson’s party came close 
to splitting over the issue of 
British participation in the 
Common Market, until the Brit- 
ish electorate voted to stay 
in last year’s referendum. So 
there was some nervousness 
in West Germany and in Rome 
today about what direction a 
different Labor Party leader 
would take. 

An Italian official said he 
was “disappointed" even by 
Mr. Wilson’s position on some 
European issues, recalling that 
the British leader was reluctant 
to cooperate with the other 
Europeans in energy policy at 
the last summit meeting in| 
Rome, and hesitant to go along 
with the direct elections propo- 
sal for the Parliament 

Hopes on Cooperation 

Here in Bonn, a West German 
diplomat said: “We assume that 
even Labor Party leaders who 
opposed joining the Common 
Market will continue to cooper- 
ate with us now because the 
referendum settled the ques- 
tion. At least that is what 
they said they would do.’ 

"The captain is leaving the 
bridge at the moment of great- 
est danger for the British ship 
of state, without clearly visible 
necessity," the Munich daily 
Sdddeutsche Zeltung wrote of 
Mr. Wilson’s sudden departure. 

Chancellor Helmut Schmidt 
was having a working lunch 
with his staff when the news 
broke early this afternoon in 
Bonn. An aide said the Chan- 
cellor was "tremendously sur- 
prised” and immediately began 
wondering who Mr. Wilson's 
successor would be. Mr.

Over the past few weeks we’ve laid to 
rest a lot of myths about foreign cars. 

In newspaper ads like this one, you’ve 
seen that GM small cars not only 
measure up to the foreign competition, 
but in many cases leave them holding 
the short end of the stick. 

Hard to believe? Here’s reassurance. 

All gas mileage ratings we’ve 
used are straight from the EPA. 

All prices we’ve used are 
Manufacturers’ Suggested Retail 
Prices— the prices each company 
suggests for its own cars. 

And all figures on maintenance 
and warranties are taken directly 
from car owners’ manuals and 
manufacturers’ literature. 

So whether you’re shopping for 
a new small car today, next week 
or months from now, here’s your 
chance to compare small cars. 

Just tear out this ad and take it 
with you when you shop. Because at 
GM, we want you to be armed with 
the facts, not just myths. And on that 
basis, we’re betting you’ll rediscover 
America at your GM dealers.

GM’s small cars are almost 
always priced lower than 

cotnparable foreign models r 

There was a time when small foreign cars had the 
edge on price. No more. The advantage they once 
enjoyed has been eroded by increased foreign 
labor costs, stiffer shipping charges, higher 
inflation, currency devaluation and other factors. 
So today, instead of showing us up in the price 
department, they usually come in second best. 
Take a look at the following charts— broken out by 
"Small Economy Cars" and "Small Sporty Cars" 
—and you'll see what we mean.

our small cars were rated at a very competitive 
35 mpg in the EPA highway test, 22 mpg in the city 
test. Fact is, it isn't only Chevette that got an 
impressive gas mileage rating. Our other small 
cars are right up there, too. 

Of course, the actual mileage you get will vary 
according to the kind of driving you do, your driving 
habits, your car's condition and available equipment

So there you have it. Head-to-head 
comparisons between GM’s small 
cars and the popular .foreign 
imports. We think the facts show 
that GM small cars have come into

But the best way to decide is 
to drive the cars that interest you 
...ours and theirs. ■ 

We think you’ll prefer GM’s.

Representative Herman Ba- 
dillo of the Bronx said he hoped 
Mr. Rohatyn. the chief of 
Governor Carey's economic re* 
ca\ety program, had "spoken 
out of ignorance" and offered 
to conduct the state official! 
on a tour of "millions of square! 
feet" of city space more appro- 
priate for industrial develop- 
ment. 

Representative Charles B. 
Rangel of Harlem offered to 
introduce Mr. Rohatyn to com- 
munity planning boards, say- 
ing that "maybe he’s just un- 
aware of what exists in this 
city." 

Both Representatives, speak- 
ing from their Washington of- 
fices. accused Mr. Rohatyn of 
promoting the interests of bank- 
ers over those of the people, j

The Rohatyn proposal on; 
Monday Followed a similar sug-i 
gestaon for "planned shrink- J 
age" by the city’s Housing i 
and Development’ Administra-j 
tor. Roger Starr, last month. 1 . 
The Starr remarks touched off | 
a storm of protests. 

"I want to register the 
strongest possible proest." Mr. 
Badillo said of Mr. Rohatvn’s 
proposal. He said the Municipal - 
Assistance Corporation chair-: 
man was "following in Rogerj 
Starr's footsteps in his callous; 
disregard for human lives." : j 
"For him to say he has to 
clear residential areas of the. 
city shows he does not under-, 
stand," said Mr. Badillo, a for-: 
mer Borough President of ihe> 
Bronx and City Housing Com-i 
missioner. “Let him use up; 
■vacant land already there." he; 
said. j 

Mr. Badillo said some of the! 
areas more appropriate for in-i 
dustrial development in Kewi 
York City included some 73] 
acres of open land next toi 
Co-op City in the Bronx, thel 
Brooklyn Navy Yard, unused! 
pliers, vacant factory buildings! 
and unused railroad lines. ' 
*Td be glad to show him; 
these areas and many others,"] 
Mr. Badillo said. i 

The Bronx Representative! 
said: “I hope Mr. Rohatyn’s 1 
statement was made out of 1 
ignorance and that he simply 
hasn't done his homework yet.j 
I would hate to think thaij 
he was using the subterfuge 
of economic development to 
implement Mr. Starr's inhu- 
mane proposals for New' York." 

Mr. Rangel said the sugges- 
tion was evidence of the .Ameri- 
can concept of "its third- world 
policy coming home — almost as 
if Moynihan was running this 
state," referring to Daniel P- 
Moynihan. former United] 
States representative at the: 
LTnited Nations. [ 

"It amounts to an anempt; 
to deport blacks and Puerto; 
Ricans from the regions that, 
arc vital to the commerce and! 
transportation of our city." Mr.; 
Rangel said, “Wc cannot get; 
away from the fact that if 
the cities were not inhabited, 
by people of color, the planners : 
would have the ingenious crea-. 
tivitv to think of other ajhi 
proaches to the problem.* !

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEUNESDA Y, MAtU-ti 17, 


Father of Miss Hearst on Stand 


Continued From Page I, Col. 3 


Government consultant on Miss 
Hearst's mental condition, had 
made a proposal to him that a 
public trial be avoided. 

Mr. Hearst quoted Dr. Fort 
as saying, "A public trial 
would be bad for Patty." Ac- 
cording to Mr. Hearst, Dr. Fort 
suggested that Mr. Hearst 
examine the situation. 

— Randolph A. Hearst, a tall, 
signs of the resentment or 
wnen we went to Mexico." he 

"He suggested — he didn't use 
the word, but plea bargaining 
was wbat it amounted to," Mr. 
Hearst said. 

He said that he had called 
William Coblents, a lawyer 
here, for advice and was told 
that "nothing should be done 
at this time." 

On cross-examination by the 
Government, Mr. Hearst said 
of Dr. Fort's remarks, "I 


wouldn't say he was trying to 
fix" the case. 


When Dr. Fort was cross- 
examined earlier in the trial, 
F. Lee Bailey. Miss Hearst’s 
chief defense lawyer, shouted 
at him the accusation “You 
tried to fix this case behind 
my back" by advising the 
Hearsts to consider some ac- 
tion — such as plea-bargaining — 
that would avoid a public trial. 

Dr. Fort said that he had 
indeed advised the Hearsts to 
consider this, but denied that 
he had done so without Mr. 
Bailey’s knowledge. 

Albert Johnson, one of Miss 
Hearst’s lawyers, took the 
stand to testify that he and 
Mr. Bailey had been notified 
by the Hearsts when Dr. Fort 
made his proposal and told 
tehem to go along with it to 
see what the prosecution “was 
up to." It turned out. Mr. 
Bailey said, that the prosecu- 
tion "was not up to anything." 

Miss Hearst's lawyers said 
as court closed tonight that 
they would call her mother. 
Catherine Campbell Hearst, to- 
morrow. 

The wealthy couple have sat 
on the hard oak benches in 
the front row of Federal Dis- 
trict Court here every court 
day since Jan. 26 when their 
daughter's trial began on the 
charge that site helped the self- 
styled Symbionese Liberation 
Army to take 510,690 at gun- 
point from the Sunset branch 
of the Hibernia Bank on April 
15. 1974. 

Earlier. Patricia Tobin, the 
bank president’s daughter, and 
Miss Hearst, who Is on trial 
for robbing his bank, smiled 
the warm smile of close friends 
as they looked at each other 
across the courtroom when 
Miss Tobin was called as a wit- 
ness for the defense. 

"We are very close friends." 
Miss Tobin testified. They met, 
she said, "in the summer after 
fourth grade" at the Burlin 
game Country Club, frequented 
by the wealthy families living 


of Michael Tobin, president of 
the Hibernia Bank, and Ran- 
dolph Apperson Hearst, pres- 
ident of The San Francisco 
Examiner and chairman of the 
board of directors of the Hearst 
Corporation. 

Miss Tobin was called by 
the defense in an attempt to 
cast doubt on the apparuent

mate, and one was from Dr.

Mr. Wayne said that Dr. Fort 
was working for Mr. Bruce 
as a consultant in the come- 
dian's attempt to defeat a com- 
mitment order for his drug 
addiction. Mr. Wayne said that 
that he should

Both Dr. Harry Kozol of Bos- 
ton and Dr. Fort said that they 
believed Miss Hearst and joined 
the S.L.A., which had kid- 
napped her 10 weeks earlier, 
although she has contended she 
did not join four of its mem- 
bers in the holdup willingly 
but was coerced into it by 
them. 

Dr. Nicholas Groth. a clinical 
psychologist in Massachusetts, 
was called by be defense. Dr. 
Kozol testified earlier that he 
bad dismissed Dr. Groth for 
some undisclosed “misbehavi- 
or" with a male inmate at the 
center for diagnosis and treat-

Mr. Essen said that in Miami 
in June 1963. he took a job 
as a lawyer to advise Mr. B 
ruce on constitutional aspects

rect examination, Mr. Essen 
said "I saw bottles that he 
[Mr. Bruce] represented to me 
to be drugs," and that the 
name of "Dr. Joel Fort" was 
on at least one bottle. But 
on cross-examination by United 
States Attorney James L. 
Browning Jr n Mr. Essen said 
that he did not see on any 
bottles any doctor’s name that 
he could now remember. 

He said that Mr. Bruce told

which Dr. Kozol directed. 

Today, with a succession of 
witnesses including a private 
detective from Los Aogeles, : 
lawyer from Miami and a psy- 
chiatrist from San Francisco, 
these accusations were .made 
against Dr. Fort; 

<3He provided same drugs 
for Lenny Bruce, the late come- 
dian, who was a convicted ad- 
dict. 

qHis reputation for truth and 
veracity in the medical profes- 
sion here was bad. 

«He did not tell the exact 
truth about bow he came not 
to be a member of the Ameri- 
can Psychiatric Association. He 
said that he had qiiitinprotes t , 
but the defense produced re- 
cords indicating tht he had 
been dropped for not paying 
dues. 

The material about Dr. Fort’s 
purported relationship with 
Lenny Bruce was presented 
through Seymour Wayne, a 
Los Angeles private detective 
and Richard Joe Essen, a law- 
yer from Miami. 

Mr. Wayne said that he was 
hired by Mr. Bruce in 1963 


“it was a pity you can’t get 
a prescription for heroin, be- 
cause he was sure he coul 
get one from Joel Fort, a hell 
of a guy, who he hoped never 
would get in any trouble.” 

Mr. Essen also said that Mr. 
Bruce bad said that “as long 
as he was able to get those 
drugs and prescriptions from 
Dr. Fort he would have nr 
problems.” 

In his testimony. Dr. Fort 
was asked by Mr. Bailey on 
cross-examinat about his rela- 
tionship with Mr. Bruce. Dr. 
Fort said that he had never 
prescribed drugs for Mr. Bruce. 

Dr. James M. Stubblebine, 
a psychiatrist here, testified 
today that nine years ago Dr. 
Fort worked under him in the 
San Francisco Health Depart- 
ment. Dr. Fort was discharged, 
Dr. Stubblebine said. 

Mr. Bailey asked the witness 
for his view of Dr. Fort’s repu- 
tation for truth and veracity 
in the professional community 
to which both belong.

said that he had found Mr.

There was no cross-examina-

convicted mass murderer, and 
her friend Susan Murphy were 
convicted by a jury today of

and the panel began its de- 
liberations.

threats to business and gov-jbill on fire in front of the jury

Her statement to . e 3 U |Y| included an archeologist who 


was the only defense Miss Good 
made to the charges that she 
conspired to mail 171 threaten- 
ing letters and made threats 
during interstate phone inter- 
views with three radio stations 
and a newspaper. 

Each of the five counts car- 
ries a possible penalty of five 
years in prison and a $5,000 
fine. 

Miss Murphy, 33, was 
charged with the single count 
of conspiracy to mail the 
letters. 

She is a former roommate of 
Miss Good and another Man- 
son cultist, Lynette Frorame, 
who was convicted of trying 
to murder President Ford. Mr, 
Manson is serving life in prison 
for tbe 1969 Sharon Tate mur- 
ders in Los Angeles. 


Miss Tobin told the jury that 
before Miss Hearst was abduct- 
ed they saw each other at 
intervals, and that Miss Hearst 
had no political view and no 
belief in feminist revolutionary 
activity. 

During the jail meeting, “her 
speech was really different 
than before.” Miss Tobin said. 

Slow. Dazed. Not like the 
same person. No spontaneity 
or animation. She droned on: 
Sighed a lot Looked terrible.” 

Miss Tobin said that the two 
talked, but interrupted each 
other, and the answers were 
not responsive. 

She said that she first beard 
the tape of the meeting when 
Dr. Louis Jolyon West, a de- 


them were not audible on the 
tape recording. 

Albert Johnson, a defense 
lawyer, took Miss Tobin 
through some sections of a 
transcript of the tape, such 
as Miss Hearst’s declaration 
“my politics are real different 
from way back when,” and 
Miss Tobin said that this was 
the kind of talk she never 
heard from. Miss Hearst before. 

Mr. Johnson read a part of 
the transcript in which Miss 
Hearst asked about visitors and 
seemed disappointed that she 
would have no more that day. 
Miss Tobin said that Miss 
Hearst was “quite confused." 

A section in which Miss 
Hearst commented about tapes 
made with her voice was point- 
ed out bv Mr. Johnson. Miss 
Tobin said that she remem- 
bered that Miss Hearst had 
said in that part of the conver- 
sation 1 


"They should, like, disregard 
those last tapes ... It was 
like a staged kind of thing 
. . . It wasn't me." 

Miss Hearst was testified that 
she was forced to read scripts 
prepared by Angela Atwood 
and later scripts prepared by 
Emily Harris, both members 
of the S..LA. 

Miss Tobin said that one 
garbled section of the tape con- 
tained material in which Miss 
Hearst had said “these people 
are so crazy or weird." 

The witness characterized as 
"totally false" the assertion 
that Miss Hearst before her 
kidnapping was "a rebel with- 
out a cause." That assertion/ 
was made by Dr. Harry Kozol, j 
a second Government expert 
witness who said that he be- 
lieved Miss Hearst was a volun- 
tary member of the S.L.A. " 


has testified as an expert wit- 
ness on a piece of jewelry 
Miss Hearst was given by Wil- 
liam Wolfe, a deceased member 
of the self-styled Symbionese 
Liberation Array. 

Scholarly legal journals are 
full of articles about various 
types of expert testimony and 
its reliability on matters rang- 
ing from hair fibers to hand- 
writing. Two years ago two 
writers in the California Law 
Review generated considerable 
heat with an article entitled 
“Psychiatry and the Presump- 
tion of Expertise: Flipping 
Coins in the Courtroom.” 

Additionally, Professor Mun- 
ster and several other profes- 
sors who teach evidence, the 
legal subject in which expert 
testimony is covered, noted 
that disputes among experts 
occurred in many other situa- 
tions — ranging from damaged 
ears to how a lathe works. 

“In practically any litigation 
you may have a battle of ex- 
perts,” stated David Baum, a 
personal injury lawyer here.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY. MARCH 17. 1976 _ 



Asks Aid of Outside Experts 
to Get Better Results in 
Rent Subsidy Program 


By ERNEST HOLSENDOLPH 

Spedsl Lo Thr New York Times 

WASHINGTON, March 16— 
The Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, which 
has repeatedly defended its 
widely criticized rental housing 
program for the poor, is now 
looking for a private consultant 
to help find remedies for the 
program’s shortcomings. 

In 18 months of operation 
the rent subsidy program called 
Section 8 has put only 8,000 
families in apartments — and 
thus provoked protests from 
housing officials and Congress* 
men. 

The department, with plans 
to spend SI billion on the pro- 
gram *his year, had promised 
to provide 400,000 families 
with apartments by June 30, 
"7- the former end of the fiscal 
year, but most observers are 
; sore they will not come dose. 
As recently as March 2, Sec- 
retary Carla A. Hills defended 
' the program before a Congres- 
sional committee and insisted 
. that "impatience early in the 
'■ game is really counterproduc- 
; five.” 

.1 .. The department's patience 
: evidently is getting shorter. In 
•• a 236-page paper outlining 
what it needs from outside 
experts, the department called 
for an assessment of section 
S’s “operations and perform- 
ance and [steps] to identity 
opportunities for realizing im- 
provements in program effi- 
ciency, effectiveness, and equi- 
ty.” 

Under Section 8 of the Hous- 
ing and Community Develop- 
ment Act of 1974, passed in 
August 1974. H.U.D. provides 
funds to local housing authori- 
ties to assist poor-to-modest in- 
come families to rent apart- 
ments they could not otherwise 
afford without paying more 
than 25 percent of their income. 
Help for Property Owners 
The rent supplements are 
supposed to put families in 
existing apartments — and also 
;to stimulate property owners 
to refurbish run-down apart- 
ments and build new ones. 

The administration has gam- 
bled heavily on the program. 
It has closed the financing 
valves on such older programs 
.as public housing, urban renew- 
al and various other programs 
to subsidize the construction of 
housing, and thus has left Sec- 
tion 8 as the only Federal pro- 
gram for housing the poor. 

Only dwindling amounts of 
money are now being received 
by localities for uncompleted 
' projects and others previously 
approved but not financed. 

In its request for an outside 
analysis, the housing department 
says it is troubled most of all 
about the prospects of the rent- 
subsidy program in rural areas, 
acknowledged by most housing 
specialists to have an even 
more serious shortage of sound 
housing than the large cities. 

Jn addition, the department 
said it had to know more about 
the implications of the follow- 
ing: 

«SThe department’s schedule) 
of “fair market rents" in each 
metropolitan area, which in- 
v eludes the maximum apartment 
rents allowable for a landlord 
taking part in the subsidy pro- 
gram. 

®The quality and cost of the 
work that local housing author- 
ities do in carrying out the 
subsidy program. 

<?The housing quality stand- ' 
ards that property must pass! 
to be approved for subsidized! 
tenants. i 

CWho takes part in the pro- 
gram, including an income and 
racial breakdown of the partici- 
pating tenants and a study of 
the landlords taking part. 

qWhich jurisdictions are par- 
ticipating in the rent subsidy 
program "to determine where, 
if at all. housing needs are 
not being met and to suggest 
ways of improving program 
coverage.” 

Concerning the special prob- 
lem of applying the Section 
S program to rural areas, the! 
department's paper said: 

“There is reason to believe 
that this latest H.U.D. housing} 
assistance program may not. 
be stiff iceint to meet the needs' 
of certain rural areas, particu-l 
larlv those characterized byj 
severely substandard occupied) 
housing stocks and declining, 
economies.” 

The department asks for an 
analysis of Section S activity 
in the metropolitan areas first. | 
with the rural question and 
others to be part of a lateri

CAN ONE OF CANADA'S 
MOST SUCCESSFUL 
INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES 
GET GLOBAL RECOGNITION 
WITH ANAME CHANGE? 


YES. HOW? 


By changing our name we are now able to market our products throughout the 
world under one corporate name. This means instant recognition no matter 

where we sell our products. . _ . . . 

Before we changed our name we sold our product asNorthem Elecmc in most or 
the world. But in the largest single telecommunications market of them all, the 
United States, we were unable to do so. 

In the United States the Northern Electric name was already being used by a 
manufacturer of electrical appliances. In addition, a competitive manufacturer 
there uses the name North Electric. Obvious elementsof confusion forcustomeis, 
suppliers and investors alike. 

To eliminate such' confusion we have changed our name to Northern Telecom, a 
name we have used successfully in the U.S. since 1971. It is the name by which 
we will be known wherever in the world we design, manufacture or sell our 
products. 

WHOANDWHATWEARE 

We are the principal manufacturer of telecommunications equipment in Canada 
and the second largest in North America. Sales in 1975 exceeded one billion 
dollars. 

In 33 factories — 24 in Canada, six in the U.S. and one each in Turkey, Ireland 
and Malaysia — we manufacture one of the broadest lines of telecommunica- 
tions equipment in the industry. 

Our products are conceived and designed in Canada’s largest industrial 
research organization, Bell-Northern Research. From these labs has come 
personal and business telephone equipment that has established design 
and performance standards for the world; electronic private automatic 
branch exchanges that have made us the largest single EPABX sup- 
plier to the North American 
telephone industry, outside 
the U.S. Bell System, and the 
SP-1 electronic central office 
switching exchange that, in 
the four years since its intro- 
duction in North America, 
has outsold all competitive 
systems. To date more than . 

1.2 million lines of SP-1 have 
been sold.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1976 


Ford Victor Over Reagan , 
Carter Winner in Illinois 


it 


Continued From Page I, Cot l|and icy roads that made 

! ' “ - i hazardous' for some of the 

candidate, Erwin A. France, 
farmer head of Chicago's Model 
el ties program. Both candi- 
dates are black. 

There were promptings from 


Ford campaign headquarters in 
Washington that it was time 
for Mr. Reagan to withdraw. 
But as early as last week, Mr. 
Reagan conceded that he wouid 
lose in Illinois. He said he 
would be content with 40 per- [ 
cent of the Republican primary 
vote and promised to stay in 
the race. 

. ; In a telephone message to a 
Republican dinner in. Ws home- 
town of Grand Rapids, Mich.. 
btr. Ford tonight termed his 
showing “a great victory and 
another real clincher in our ef- 
fort to win tbe nomination and 
go on to victory in 1976.” 

Stuart Spencer, the Presi- 
dent's acting campaign chair- 
man. said that Mr. Reagan 
should withdraw ‘‘the sooner 
the better,” adding "not beyond 
North Carolina.” 

Cali For Unity 

* * Rogers C. B. Morton, Mr. 

Ford's political counsel, told 
fiewsmen in Washington that 
allies to talk "across the fence' 
td- Mr- Reagan's supporters 
about uniting behind the Presi- 
dent but had not yet received a 
repJy. 

- He too said that he hoped 
that after the North Carolina 
primary next Tuesday Mr. Rea- 
gan would find it a "propitious 
time" for him to “want to be 
part of a real Republican ef- 
fort ana throw his hat in with 
the President” 

In a statement issued from 
his press office in Los Angeles, 
Mr. Reagan said: 

“We appear 'to have met our 
goal with something over 4p 
percent of the vote. I have 
never been under any illusion 
that our grassroots campaign 
could successfully buck both 
the Illinois Republican organi-j 
cation and the promises being 
issued so bountifully by the 
White House. 

"However, the fact that .1 
have won something over 40 
percent of the vote in this or- 
ganization-dominated slate 
once again indicates there is 
major dissatisfaction in our 
party with the kind oF leader- 
ship* it has been receiving. 

"I look forward now to the 
North Carolina primary next 
week. Again. I wish to assurq 
my supporters that we are 
winning in the convention 
states and that the South and 
West continue to look favor- 
able.” 

"As long as this outlook re- 
mains unchanged I am confi- 
dent that we will go to the na- 
tional convention in August 
with at least a 50-50 chance of 
winning the nomination.” 

The Presidential portion of 
the Illinois primary is com- 
posed of two parts, the voter 
preference race and the elec- 
tion of delegates to the Demo- 
cratic and Republican national 
conventions. 

The delegate contests were 
regarded as the more impor- 
tant of the two by a number of 
Illinois politicians, including 
Mayor Daley, who heads the 
powerful Cook County Demo- 
cratic machine. 

Mr. Daley fielded a large 
slate of delegate candidates 
committed to Senator Adiai E. 
Stevenson 3d, who is not a 
Presidential candidate. He did 
so in the expectation of round- 
ing up a large bloc of delegates 
to bargain with at the Demo- 
cratic National Convention. 

Others running delegate 
slates were Governor Walk- 
er. Mr. Harris, Mr. Carter and 
Mr. Wallace. A large number 
of delegate candidates also ran 
uncommitted to any candidate. 

Two leading Democratic Pres- 
idential contenders. Senator 
Henry M. Jackson of Washing- 
ton and Representative Morris 
K. Udall of Arizona, did not 
enter the Illinois contest. 

Some Coming Later 
The Democrats elected 155 
delegates, with 14 more to be 
picked later for a total of 169. 
The Republicans picked 96 del- 
egates with another five to 
be chosen later, for a total 
of 101. j 

Mr. Carter's showing in Uli- j 
rois shored up his position as I 
the front-runner of the centeri 


state's 5.8 million voters to 
get to the polls. The polls were 
open from 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., 
(Central Standard time. 

In the first three and one-half 
hours of voting in Chicago, 
the city's election commission- 
ers received about 200 com- 
plaints of alleged infractions, 
most of them involving elec- 
tioneering at polling places. In 
suburban parts of Cook County, 
where Mr. Walker was count- 
ing on a sizable vote, a number 
of voting machines malfunc- 
tioned. 

Enthusiasm Wanes 

In recent days, enthusiasm 
for the Presidential primary, 
or "beauty contest," flagged 
somewhat, particularly after 
Mr. Reagan had conceded his 
native state to the president. 

The focus of the machine 
has been on the election of 
delegates to help assure Mr. 
Daley a broker's role at the 
national convention and on key 
state and local races. Mayor 
Daley regards the results of 
tbe Presidential popularity con- 
test as doomed to wane in 
the months ahead when 25 
other state primaries will be 
held. 

The Presidential primary 
contestants viewed the voting 
as a test of their drawing pow- 
er in a major Northern indus- 
trial state, one that also con- 
tains some of the country’s 
richest farm lands. 

Few Republicans 

The Republicans shunned] 
Chicago mainly because Repub 
lican voters are a scant minori- 
ty in the overwhelmingly Dem- 
ocratic city. The Democratic 
candidates soft-pedaled their 
visits mainly because of Mr. 
Daley’s noncommittal stand in 
the preference primaries. 

Mr. Carter hop - scotched 
around the state, focusing his 
attention on rural areas as well 
as on the band of smaller cities 
that gird the middle part of 
Illinois. 

On one foray into Chicago, 
he was well received at a gath- 
ering at a black church on 
the city’s overwhelmingly black 
South "Side. He also delivered 
the first outline of his foreign 
policy posture before the Chica- 
go Council on Foreign Rela- 
tions. enunciating a theme that 
the nation's dealings in world 
affairs whouid be made with 
more consultation with Con-, 
gress than it has been under 
Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger. 

Mr. Wallace, sensitive to the 
health issue after his showing 
in Florida, repeatedly asserted 
in his campaigning in Illinois 
that he was perfectly fit. His 
appeals were directed mainly 
to the ... constituency he has 
Jong attracted, those adopting 
a conservative posture on racial 
and social issues. He also relied

ability, in competition with Mr. 
Carter, to attract more than a 
[hard core of supporters. 

As in Florida a week ago, a 
New York Times /CBS News 
survey of voters leaving their 
polling places showed that Mr. 
Wallace's paralysis worried 
four of 10 Democrats. 

Strength Down 

Even among those who 
thought his health good, even 
among those who expressed 
anti -black and anti -welfare 
emotions, even in the pre- 
cincts where Mr. Wallace had 
run strongly as an independent 
candidate in the I96S Presiden- 
tial election. Mr. Wallace could 
win only a third of the vote 
Unless he can find a new 
formula, the Illinois returns 
seem to indicate that the Ala- 
bamian is unlikely to repeat 
his 1972 triumph in northern 
states like Michigan. 

Mr. Carter’s greatest strength 
came in northwestern Illinois 
— a prosperous farming area 
studded with such politically 
moderate cities as Rockford, 
Moline and Galesburg, where 
he was apparently helped by 
his own farm background. But 
he more than held his own in 
Cook County, which includes 
Chicago and most of its sub- 
urbs. 


candidates, and more heavily 
from liberals in Florida, where 
he stood to the left of his prin- 
cipal adversaries. 

His main points of appeal, 
according to The Times/CBs 
poll, were his perceived elect- 
ability and his availability as 
an alternative to those who frit 
they could not vote for Mr. 
Wallace because they were un- 
sure of his health. 

About 40 percent of those 
who voted for all the Democ- 
ratic candidates except Mr. 
Wallace said they would have 
voted for Senator Hubert H. 
Humphrey of Minnesota had 
his name been listed on the 
preferential ballot. Had he cam- 
paigned here, that figure might 
have been even larger. 

Such findings, combined with! 


Mr. Carter pulling roughly half, 
the black vote, more than 
doubling the performance of 
Mr. Shriver, who had strong 
credentials among black voters 
because of his work in the 
Federal antipoverty program. 
Blacks accounted for more 
than a fifth of the Democratic 
vote here. 

Mr. Shriver had hoped to 
breathe new life into a dying 
campaign here in Illinois, where 
he lived as a young man. He 
had won the support of some 
of Mr. Daley’s key lieutenants 
though not of the Mayor him- 
self, and that enabled him to 
run a respectable race within 
Chicago. 

But elsewhere he got almost 
nothing, and a staff member 
said tonight that he had been 
dealt “a lethal blow” here. With 
his campaign already heavily 
in debt, most Democrats ex- 
pect the former Peace Corps 
director to pull out. 

For Mr. Reagan, there was 
nothing to cheer about in 


the entry of substantial num-1 Illinois. In a state typical of 


issue that cut most deeply. 
About half the Republicans 
thought the economy was get- 
ting better, no fewer than 
three-quarters of those who 
thought so chose the President 
Only about one Republican in 
six ' thought it was getting 
worse, and though Mr. Reagan 
carried those with that view, 
they were too few to help. 

Had the Californian suc- 
ceeded in his recent efforts to 
convince Republicans that the 
recent signs of recovery are il- 
lusory, he might have stood a 
better chance. 

As it is, the Ford organiza- 
tion plans to bring tbe maxi- 
mum possible pressure on Mr. 
Reagan to pull out in the next 
week, citing the need for party 
unity — and hoping that a Ford 
victory in North Carolina will 
settle the matter. 

There are few politicians 
who believe that Mr. Reagan, 
even though he came tantatiz- 
ingly close to the President in 
New Hampshire and Florida, 
can survive into April.

CHICAGO. March IB — Mi- 
chael J. Hewlett, the candidate 
of Mayor Richard J. Daley and 
the Cook County machine, de- 
feated Gov. Daniel Walker, a 
maverick, in the Illinois Demo- 
cratic primary today. 

Returns from around the 
state and projections from a 
New York Times/CBS News 
poll of 1.060 persons just after 
they voted gave the victory to 
Mr. HowJett, the 61 -year- old 
Secretary of State. 

With 1,532, or 14 percent, 
of 11,272 precincts reporting, 
the tally was: 

Howlett 141.309 f5S%) 

Walker 101,924 (42%) 

In another race, the Daley 
machine took a beating. Repre- 
sentative Ralph J. Metcalfe, 
whose ouster had been sought 
by the Mayor, defeated the ma- 
chine candidate, Erwin A. 
France,.^ former Model Cities 
director and aide to Mr. Daley. 
The two candidates, both black, 
had fought a bitter campaign. 

Mayor Daley disliked Mr. 
Metcalfe only slightly less than 
he did Mr. Walker.

Mr. Carter, trying for a first-

candidacy.

Mr. Carter eclipsed Mr. Wal- 
lace for the second consecutive 
week. He won a major victory 
over Mr. Wallace in Florida 
last week in a state where the 
Alabama Governor received 42 
percent of the vote in 1972. 

Governor Wallace was run- 
ning in the Illinois primary 
for the First time. In the 196S 
general election, Mr. Wallace, 
who was running against’ 
Hubert H. Humphrey and Rich- 1 
ara M. Nixon, received S.5 per-i

mittee mused the other day, 
was to Jet his friends turn

nist It may have 
cost Mr. Reagan 
the Republican 
Presidential nom- 
ination. 

Tonight, ten years after his 
California political manage- 
ment company made Mr. 
Reagan a successful "citi- 
zen" candidate for governor, 
Stuart Krieg Spencer (the un- 
used middle name means 
"war" in German* tracked 
the returns from the Illinois 
primary and tried to- -guess 
how much longer it would 
take to finish off -Mr. ' Reag- 
an's challenge to President 
Ford. 

No one was surprised last 
Saturday that the President ■ 
named Mr. Spencer acting

paign in place- of Howard

confirmed the obvious, ft was 
he who turned the Ford can-’ 
didaev from a disjointed, 
aimless, seeming loser last 
fall into something of a 
smooth, effective juggernaut 
in the winter primaries. 

"It’s of some advantage . 
to have some 'insight into .

said mildly as he sat in a

■liance, baffle ’em with bull.’ 

A Lesson for Novices 
Stu Spencer has been daz- 
zling political novices in the 
White* House and apparently 
baffling the Reagan camp 
since he showed up in' Wash- 
ington last September in a 
blue suit with purple. piping 
that prompted some- Ford 
aides to liken him to a tele- 
graph messenger. 

It was Mr. Spencer who 
designed the Ford campaign's 
attack on Mr. Reagan’s plan 
to transfer $90 billion or 


to states' control and, as 
Mr. Spencer later crowed, 
caused Mr. Reagan to “stag- 
ger for three days" while 
the Ford organization, pulled 
itself together ufNew Hamp- 
shire. 

It was Mr. Spencer who 
persuaded the White House 
that artful timing of official 
announcements — -mass tran- 
sit funds for Miami, an inter- 
national convention in Orlan- 
do. a possible new veterans' 
hospital in St. Petersburg — 
could prove in the crucial 
Florida primary that Republi- 
cans should cling to the ad- 
vantages of Presidential in- 
cumbency. 

"Politics and government 
are one and the same thing." 
Mr. Spencer said. "The Amer- 
ican people accept that pre- 
mise. F.D.R., Truman, Eisen- 
hower, Kennedy and every- 
body else dealt to their 
strengths. We de3l to our 
strength. We use incum- 
bency” 

That pithy tactical summa- 
ry is typical of the perpetual- 
ly rumpled, 49 - year - old 
professional politician who, 
with William Roberts, formed 
' Spencer - Roberts &. Asso- 
ciates 16 years ago in Long 
Beach, Calif., and, when Mr. 
Roberts tired of the game 
two years ago and sold his 
interest, stayed on because 
"I’m a political junkie." 

‘Palace Guard’ Blamed 
- Ironically, Mr. Reagan be- 
gan crying foul about the 
overt reliance on incumbency 
after losing the Florida pri- 
mary last week. At one point, 
Mr. Reagan charged that the 
tactics were to be expected 
of those who "virtually de- 
stroyed the Republican' Par- 
ty” when Spencer-Robens 
managed kelson A. Rockefel- 
ler's 1964 presidential bid 
against Bariy Gold water in 
* California. 

After 1970, however, the 
partnership with Governor 
Reagan soured, and Mr. 
Spencer blames the "paiace 
guard," aides in Sacramento 
who started to "bad-mouth 
my business." 

President Ford hired Spen- 
cer-Robens las: summer to 
help his candidacy in the 
Western states and. when 
it became apparent in Octo-

paign was wallowing, he ir,- 



The New York Times/CBS 
News poll is based on inter- 
views with a random sampling 
of Illinois voters as they left 
the polls yesterday. Twenty 
voting precincts throughout the 
state were selected and, within 
each precinct, each voter had 
an equal chance of selection. 

In all, 1.060 voters were 
interviewed, including 716 Dem- 
ocratic voters and 344 Repub- 
lic voters. 

One possible source of error 
in a survey such as this is sam- 
pling error. One can say with 
95 percent certainty that results 
based upon the entire sample 
differ by no more titan 3 points, 
in either direction, from whac 
would have been obtained by 
interviewing all Illinois voters. 
Results based on Democrats 
alone are unlikely to err by 
more than 4 percent, and on 
Republicans alone by more 
than 5 percent 
However, as in any survey of 
public opinion, this margin of 
error is undoubtedly somewhat 
larger because of unavoidable, 

I imperfections in the way the 
survey was constructed, and 
because some voters refused to 
be interviewed.

1976 election survey coverage

"He feels he's been poorly 
treated by the people around 
Reagan, although not so 
much by Reagan himseif." 
Mr. Roberts said. "He also 
shares my feeling that Ron

he is. 

Everyone who knows him 
describes Mr. Spencer as a

his children, Karen, 23. and 
Steven, 22. 

He was bom in Phoenix

Mr. Rockefeller said that, 
assuming Mr. Ford won the

won praise from President 
Ford yesterday at White 
House ceremonies honoring 
the seventh-grade teacher 
from Fayetteville, N. C„ as 
1976 Teacher of the Year.

School Officers, the Encyclo- 
paedia Britannica and The 
Ladies Home Journal. Her 
husband, Seldon. is an assist- 
ant principal at another 
junior high. 

To Governor James E- Hol- 
shouser of North Carolina, 
who introduced Mrs. Murch- 
ison and is a leader in the 
Ford campaign, the President 
said. "I'll see you next 
week.” Mrs. Murchison said 
she would not vote for him 
in the March 23 primary. Tra

Nastase 
Pays Up, 
Ban Off 


By FRED TUPPER 

Spccui id tIm Xrw srrk Tiroes 

CARLSBAD, Calif., March 
16 — Ilie Nastase's suspension 
was lifted today when he 
paid a $6,000 fine to the 
Canadian Tennis Association. 

"I have made a donation 
to the Canadian Tennis Asso- 
ciation fob use in a junior 
development program to 
avoid a potentially unfortu- 
nate situation that would only 
be detrimental to the game," 
was the way Nastase put 
it in a statement through 
his lawyer. 

Nastase personally said it 
quicker. "I pay and I can 
play," he told a news confer- 
ence at the La Costa Club 
where he was to face Syd 
Ball of Australia in the first 
round of the $100,000 Inde- 
pendent Players Association 
Tour final. He is seeded third 
behind Jimmy Connors and 
Guillermo Vilas of Argentina. 

Last summer the temper- 
amental Rumanian acted up 
in the final of the Canadian 
open championships in Tor- 
onto making obscene ges- 
tures and comments to the 
crowd during an indifferent 
performance on the court 
against Manuel Orantes of 
Spain. 

A fine of $8,000 was im- 
posed in September by the 
Men's Professional Tennis 
Council. Nastase appealed 
and the fine was reduced 
to $6,000. 

But Nastase would not pay 
up. So he was suspended 
yesterday by the Internation- 
al Lawn Tennis Federation 
and would not have been 
able to play at Wimbledon 
and Forest Hills, among other 
tournaments. 

The slate has been wiped 
clean now, 

“Do vou dislike your 
image?" Nastase was asked 
today. 

"If I didn't I wouldn't do 
wbat I do." 

R* 'feels that his manners 
have improved. 

“When I was young. I used 
to throw racquets." he said. 
"Now I only throw balls." 

Aside from a pulled muscle 
in his back, which he 
shrugs^ off. Nastase was 
struck with the present quali- 
ty of his play. 

"Better than 1973 [his 
great year],” he said with 
a smile. "The best since I 
was bom.” 

He is the only man to 
beat Jimmy Connors this year 
and his recent performance 
against Ken RosewaM in Ha- 
waii. when he routed the 
tour finale. He is seeded third 
41-year-old genius in straight 
sets, was scintillating. 

The mercurial star is not 
convinced that anger hurts 
his game. 

"The madder I get, the 
more hungry I am to wia." 
he said. "I think I play better 
then” 

He admits he has a hot 
temper, saying: 

“I can't help it. I don't 
have enemies. I like all the 
guys. But not on the court. 
Then you have to hate. Even 
Jimmy [his best friend]. 

Then he added: 

"For me, for the moment, 
Jimmy Connors is the best." 

In the first match today 
cagey Ray Ruffels of Austra- 
lia, ’gave a tactical lesson 
to upcoming Victor Pecci. 
the 20-year-old ^Paraguayan, 
winning by 7-6, 7-6.

"I guess, it is a historical 
event whether 1 like it or 
pot," said Bill Cofield yester- 
day after having been named 
the first black head basket- 
ball coach in the Big Ten 
Conference. The 36-year-o!d 
Cofield, who just finished 
his second year as an as- 
sistant at Virginia, was given 
a five-year contract at $25,- 
000 for the first year to try 
to turn around Wisconsin's 
lagging program. He replaced 
John Powless, who resigned 
Feb. 11 during a 14-game 
losing streak. 

Cofield said that .while he 
might have an advantage in 
recruiting blacks, he would 
seek out prospects on the 
basis of how well they could 
play, not their race.

Like almost everything 
else, the cost of playing ten- 
nis in the city’s parks is 
going up. With the outdoor 
season scheduled to start 
April 10 on the 527 municipal 
courts, the Parks Department 
is raising the price of permits 
to $27.50, a $2.50 increase. 

Last year the increase was 
$10 (from $15 to $25 j, which 
brought yells of anguish from 
the players and a drop in > 
purchases of season permits 
from 65.000 to 50,000. But 
at least the department spent 
about $700,000 in resurfacing 
some courts. There is no mo- 
ney to continue the resurfac- 
ing program this year, says 
a spokesman. 

Martin Lang, the new Parks 
Administrator, can expect a 
barrage of letters protesting 
conditions at the courts after 
the season opens. If he has 
been briefed, he will know 
that part of the job is to 
cope with the tennis players 
and their complaints. They 
may demand a water foun- 
tain. toilet facilities or better 
maintenance and supervision 
of the courts. Often, the com- 
plaints are justified. 

Suit Is Filed 
Against N.F.L. 

WASHINGTON. March 16 
OJPIV- The National Football 
League Players Association 
sued the league, the 26 teams 
and Commissioner Pete Roz- 
elle today for unspecified 
damages suffered by 79 pres- 
ent and former players under 
the Rozelte rule. 

The class action suit was 
filed in United States District 
Court in Minneapolis but an- 
nounced here by a spokes- 
man for the association's 
president, Dick Anderson. 

The spokesman said the 
suit was filed .on behalf of 
all N.F.L. players who have 
been under contract to and 
been on the active roster 
oF an N.F.L. team at any 
time since the 1972 season 
began. It follows the recent 
decision in the Mackey case 
in which the Rozelle rule 
was declared illegal under 
the Federal antitrust laws. 

A second count in the com- 
plaint was brought by Jim 
McFarland, Ron Jessie, Bob 
Grim, Frank Gallagher and 
Gary Larsen on their behalf 
and" for all N.F.L. players 
who played out their option 
since 1972 and became free 
agents. 

Rockets’ Protest Fails 

HOUSTON. March 16 (AP> 
— The National Basketball 
Association's Houston Rock- 
ets announced today they 
had received word from the 
association’s commissioner, 
Lawrence O'Brien, that their 
protest of a Feb. 21 over- 
time 110-108 loss to Phoenix 
has been turned down. The 
protest was over whether 
Curtis Periy's deciding shot 
occurred beFore or after the 
final buzzer. 

Soviet Skater Sets Mark 

MOSCOW, March 16 (UP1) 
— Galina Stepanskaya, So-

bettered the world record for 
the women's 3.000-meter race 
during a speed skating meet 
today in which the Soviet 
skaters beat the Netherlands, 
191-161. Tass, the Soviet 
press agency, said Miss Step-

As the indoor season winds 
down, owners of centers are 
keeping their hopes up for 
next winter. The general feel- 
ing is that there will be 
more competition with new 
places opening, but also more 
players. “We did all right, 
considering the state of the 
economy,” said the manager

teams. Mrs. Greenberg, a

Abe Lemons whose teams 
at Pan American University 
in Texas lost only 16 games 
in his three years at the 
helm, was named the new 
basketball coach at the Uni- 
versity of Texas yesterday. 
He replaced Leon Black, who 
resigned Feb. 28 after a los- 
ing season. Black stirred con- 
troversy by reporting alleged 
recruiting violations by Texas 

A&M. . . - 

The colorful, cigar-chew- 
ing. 53-year-old Lemons pre- 
viously coached at Oklahoma 
City. He is incoming presi- 
dent of the American Bas- 
ketball Coaches Association. 
His 21 -year won-lost record 
of 364-197, including 20-5 
this season, ranks him 
among the National Collegi- 
ate Athletic Association top 
10 winning coaches.' 

Lemons was uncertain 
about his salary and the 
length of his contract. He 
said: "A contract doesn't 
mean anything to me. If Tm 
not doing the job. Tra not go- 
ing to 'be hopscotch ing. ”11

March 16— The basebdtl la-

when the players rejected 
the "best and final" offer 
of the team owners, who 
then pulled out of town say- 
ing: “TakE ail or leave all." 

"Mo change on the opening 
of the training camps," said 
Lee MacPhail, president of

camps stayed shut for the 
16th day. '"We don't realty 
know what the next step 
will be. TJiis is a final offer."

The pitcher played last sea- 
son without having signed 
a contract, then tested the 
"reserve rule" and won his 
freedom in Federal Court-

presented their "final" offer

reaching concessions on the 
control of players. They pro-

After the elimination of 
the athletic budget, the Roo-

on 'credit and donatio ns. 
Teams used last year’s equip- 
ment, referees worked games 
for deferred payment and

der? jusi completed a 17-3 
basketball season, averaging 


he would recommend that 
"under the terms — take it 
or leave it— they not accept 
to formally reject the offer 
tomorrow. 

The players. were expected 
to formally reject the offer. 

As a result, spring training 
did not sprout anywhere in 
the 17 baseball camps in 
Florida and the seven in Ari- 
zona, and even an orderly 
start of the regular season 
on April 8 seemed in new 
jeopardy. The New York 
Mets and Pittsburgh Pirates 
canceled their two-day trip 
to Puerto Rico next week 
for the Roberto Clemente 
Youth'Fund. And the Florida 
Governor’s annual baseball 
dinner, scheduled here for 
March 30, jvas wiped out 
for the first time in 30 years. 

Basic Disagreement 
The stalemate centers on 
the “basic .agreement" be- 
tween the 24 teams and their 
600 players, a collective code 
that covers everything from 
minimum pay to meaL money 
and which expired Dec. 31. 
But the critical issue has 
been the ‘’reserve system,” . 
which binds players to their 
teams year by year, and that 
was still the issue tonight ~ 
as the optimism of the last 
week was shattered. ’ 
Ironically, or perhaps sym- 


To the club owners, it was 
an offer that the players 
could not refuse. To the play- 
ers, it was "progress" but 
ihey still refused. 

Retroactive Problem 

"We have been involved in 
negotiations for eight months 
at this point," Miller said, 
as he gave the first reaction 
of a steering committee of 
about a dozen players who 
had been sitting in on the 
talks. “But in terms of real 
collective bargaining, it was 
more like eight hours. They 
made a rather peculiar final 
proposal yesterday— peculiar 
because I have never before 
seen a long list of proposals 
‘to be discussed.’ There must 
be 14 of them in this 10-page 
document that' we haven't 
discussed yet, and they even 
left .out two, 

"There are an awful lot 
of contract hookers in this 
document. Maybe you can’t 
see the fine print, but it's 
there. Our executive board ‘ 
will make the final decision, 
but I will recommend that 
under the terms— to take it 
or leave it— the players not 
accept if 

Miller made it plain that 
the owners' chief “conces- 
sion” on the reserve system 
was still not a solution : to

nents and officials in his role 
as team captain. 

Smith, the goalie, furiously 
slashed at opponents in his 
territory, stirring more Is- 
lander penal ties and the 
North Stars’ ire. 

The penalties began at 1:25 
of the second period when 
, Newell banded Bryan Trot- 
tier a five-minute major pen- 
alty for charging. The Island- 
er rookie had compiled just 
12 penalty minutes in 70 pre- 
vious games. 

In a major penalty awarded 
for deUberate intent to in- 
jure, the penalized team re- 
mains shorthanded for the 
entire.five minutes, no mat- 
ter how many goals the op- 
position scores. While Trot- 
tier was in the box, Newell 
called a minor on Smith for 
slashing. He then slapped 
Jude Drouin with a minor for 
unsportsmanlike conduct, as 
well as a 10-minute miscon- 
duct just after New York had 
successfully killed off Trot- 
tier’s" penalty. 

Stars Capitalize 

Like a mother slapping a 
child's -hand until the young- 
ster performs properly, New- 
ell would not let the Islanders 
get away with fouls just be- 
cause they were under the 
duress of kilting penalties. 

' He sent Gerry Hart into 
the box for tripping, giving 
Minnesota another 1:35 of a 
' two-man advantage, and 1:21 
later, tha North Stars finally 
scored. Steve Jensen, the 
United States Olympic team's 
leading scorer, stood by 
Smith and stuffed the puck 
between the pads of the 
kneeling goalie. 

So infuriated were the Is- 
landers by this time that 
when Hart’s penalty time 
was up, the defenseman 
leaped from the penalty box, 
grabbed the puck, ducked un- 
der two checking North Stars 
and shot the puck from a 
comer to Jean Potvin. The 
Islander defenseman shot, 
then knocked in his rebound 
and made the score 2-1. 

The Islanders stormed Lo- 
Presti for the rest of the 
period and finished with IS 
shot* for the middle session, j 
But the 22-year-old goalie, 
in his second season, boldly 1 
turned back shots by Hen- 
ning on a breakaway and 
close shots by Bob Nystrora 
and Andre SL Laurent. 

LoPresti continued to be 
in total command during an -. 
Islander power play in the ; 
last period, enabling his team \ 
to score a shorthanded goal. ;

The Phillips who returned 
was hardly the one who had 
been benched early in the 
game when Larry Dassie and 
other Kansas State players 
had been getting past him for 
easy layups. 

Phillips had played 26 min- 
utes against Niagara in the 
first round and scored 3 
points, missed four of five 
free throws and was frequent- 
ly benched by Coach Joe 
Hall. 

"Mike has not been play- 
ing well." said Hall. “Maybe 
it’s because he’s been trying 
to do so well that he's actu- 
ally been looking bad." 

Kentucky changed its en- 
tire style of play as soon as 
Phillips showed he was on 
target. The Wildcais went to 
him inside end the big man 
responded by bullying his 
way io the basket and draw- 
ing fouls. 

“We’re a struggling team.” 
said Hall. “We've struggled 
all season and we always 
need an extra effort to do 
well. We got that from Mike, 
from James Lee and from 
Trucan Claytor.”

shot 55 percent in the first 
half "as Chuckie Williams 
scored IS of his 27 points, 
helped in its own demise. 
After the Big Eight confer- 
enc runnrup had committed 
only four turnovers .in the 
first half and failed to allow 
Kentucky a steal, Kansas 
State got sloppy in the sec- 
ond half, commiting II turn- 
overs and allowing the ball 
to be stolen five times. 

* Additionally, Kansas State 
went through a cold shoot- 
ing spell and when it missed 
its shots, Kentucky, control- 
ling the boards, got the ball 
out quickly on the break for 
easy baskets. 

“Look at our foul shoot- 
ing," said Jack Hartman, the 
losing coach. “It has to tell 
you something. We were 6 for 
16. We’ve had that kind of 
trouble all season. We don’t 
play well with big leads. 
Leads seem to put extra pres-

Excess of Racing May Spell Dearth of Racing 


At the 
Race 
Tracks 


By STEVE CADY 
In 1897, Dean Alfange 
notes in recently published 
book, America had 314 ac- 
tive race track. By 1908, the 
number had dropped- to 75. 
Alfange, the chairman of 
New York’s 
trackless quar- 
ter-horse opera- 
tion, suspects the 
same kind of up- 
heaval may be 
about to take place again. 
His explanation: too much 
racing at hundreds of tracks 
has saturated the market to 
the point where tracks in 
some areas may have to go 
out of business. 

“Tracks were being opened 
all over the country then,” 
he writes, “and many of 
them squeezed a good thing 
unconscionably. In 1890, 
races at the Guttenberg track 
in New Jersey across the 
river from Manhattan were 
run during a Minding snow- 
storm in January." 

Guttenberg was just one 
of many northern tracks that 
ran during the winter. At 
Maspeth in Queens, races 
were held day and night, 
with the aid of floodlights. 
Tracks not only competed 
with one another, they also 
competed for the favor of 
politicians. 

*Pub(ic Disgust* Cited 
In his book. “The Horse 
Racing Industry," Alfange . 
says “public disgust” played 
a large part in closing down 
most of the nation’s tracks 
in the early 1900’s. 

“I cite these facts," he 
writes, "to alert those who 
now sanction year-round rac- 
ing and wagering, come .heH 
or high water." 

Recent developments indi- 


cate that Alfange may have 
a point. In Rhode Island, 
where daytime thoroughbred 
racing sometimes draws few- 
er than 3,000 fans a day. 
Narragansett Park and Lin- 
coln Downs reportedly are 
close to a merger. 

Narragansett supposedly 
lost $600,000 last year in 
a New England area where 
harness racing, dog racing 
and the thoroughbreds have 
produced pari-mutuel over- 
kill. 

In Florida, Calder Race 
Course has asked for fewer 


titkra with Aqueduct or Bel- 
mont Park. However, offi- 
cials of the New Jersey 
Sports and Exposition Au- 
thority are predictably vague 
on the subject. 

“We won’t decide that for 
a year,” said Jack Krumpe, 
the authority’s executive di- 
rector. . - 

The light poles for night 
racing are -already in place, 
as is most of the grandstand. 
Sixteen suspension cables 
support the forward seating 
areas and roof of the glass- 
enclosed stand. Most of the 
hare 


racing dates this, year (106) 

than the 120 it had last year, r-glass panes already 
In New York, where Aque- 1)66111 installed, 
duct operated right through 
the winter, cheap horses con- 
tinue to occupy stall space 
as management struggles to 
find enough stock to fill the 
cards. 

And in New Jersey, with 
800 racing dates this year, 
the new track in the Hacken- 
sack Meadowlands threatens 
to turn Yonkers Raceway in 
New York into a housing 
development 


Work -also has progressed 
rapidly on the • concrete 
bams, where 1 .360 horses 
will be stabled, and on dor- 
mitories for stablehands. At 
the state’s “house” track, 
Meadowlands will enjoy a 
big edge over New York 


tracks m the important mat* 
ter of takeout 

Meadowlands, whose rev- 
enue will be used to pay 
off a $330 million -bond issue 
that financed the track and 
a football stadium for the 
New York Giants, pays only 
fa percent of the betting 
handle to the state. . 

Thus, the track gets to 
keep 24% percent of the 
handle on triples, J8% per- 
cent on exactas and daily 
doubles and 16% percent on 
Other wagering. 

When Meadowlands begins 
operating, the squeeze- on 
the betting dollar in this area 
wUl undoubtedly intensify. 

"There’s just too much rac- 
ing,” says Phil Johnson, one 
of New York’s leading thor- 
oughbred trainers. “It’s easy 
for jockeys and trainers to 
go 12 months a year. It’s 
not that easy for horses and 


horseplayers 

round.”

At Yonkers . • . 

Yonkers Raceway will hold 
a St Patrick’s Night promo- 
tion this evening, featuring 
a drawing for a trip to Ire- 
land, free shamrock buttons 
to everyone entering the 
track and entertainment by 
the 35-piece New York- City 
Emerald Society Police Pipe 
Band. The band will arrive at 
Yonkers directly from the an- 
nual parade earlier today 
down Fifth Avenue. 

Last night, Bret John con- 
tinued his domination of the 
Hopeful Pacing Series' for 3- 
y ear-old colts with a 2:683/5 
victory over a sloppy track. 
Bret John, driven by Del 
Insko, has won eight out of 
11 starts this season. He re- 
turned 54.20. 


New Orleans Awarded 1978 Super Bowl 


September Start Seen 

The one-mile Jersey track, 
to be called Meadowlands. 
is scheduled to open next 
Sept. 1 with a 100-night 
meeting of harness racing. 
Under new legislation that 
increased racing dates in 
New Jersey by 100 thor- 
oughbred and 100 stand- 
ardbred, Meadowlands will 
have 100 days or nights oF 
flat racing and possibly as 
many as 150 nights of har- 
ness. racing. 

Thoroughbred racing will 
not begin there until August 
1977, and the guessing is 
that it will be held at night 
to avoid head-to-head compe-

CORONADO. Calif., March 
1 6 — After a nnouncing tha t 
Super Bowl XII will be 
played in the. Superdome in 
New Orleans on Jan. 15, 
1978. owners of the National 
Football League’s 28 clubs 
continued their annual meet- 
ing today with more disturb- 
ing items to consider. 

Shortly after their morning 
session about a Super Bowl 
site, they were informed that 
the threatened ■ lawsuit .by 
79 present and former play- 
ers for unspecified damages, 
growing out of the antitrust 
decision against the N.F.L. 
in the John Mackey case, 
had actually been filed. It 
was not a surprise, but it 
was no less disconcerting for 
that. 

The clubs face further dam- 
ages that may be awarded 
Joe Kapp, In his trial now 
in progress in San Francisco. 
Not of direct concern to the 
other owners, but still un- 
pleasant, is a $15 million 
suit filed yesterday by Eu- 
gene Klein, majority owner 
of the San Diego Chargers.

against the minority owners 
who had sued to displace 
him. And the lawsuits could 
not be separated from the 
position the clubs must work 
out for collective bargaining 
with the players, which will 
he resumed after these meet- 
ings end. 

Also on the agenda are 
the setting of dates for the 
college and expansion drafts; 
action on requests bv Mem- 
phis and Birmingham to be 
admitted as new teams in 
1976; changes in playing 
rules, and determination of 
the size of a roster, an item 
that must subsequently be 
brought to the Players Asso- 
• ciation. 

Next year's Super Bowl 
will be played in the Rose 
Bowl at Pasadena. Last 
year's was in Miami, and 
the one before that was in 
New Orleans, although the 
Superdome wasn’t ready 
then and the game was 
played in Tulane Stadium. 
Houston, Miami and Los An- 
geles were the other appli- 
cants this time. 

“Actually', the decision was 
to keep rotating among the 
suitable cities,” said Commis- 
sioner Peter RozeUe. “The 


decision wasn’t unanimous, 
but it got more than the 


LANDOVER, Md., March l'6 
(UPI) — Power- play goals by 
J ean Lemieux and Gerry 
Meehan and brilliant play by 
Ron Low, the goalie, led the 
Washington Capitals- to a 
5-2 National Hockey League 
victory over the New York 
Rangers tonight. 

Low turned away 36 shots 
as Washington recorded its 
ninth victory, eclipsing last 
year’s season total of eight 
Phil Esposito’s 30th goal 
of the season at 14:20 of the 
third period ruined Low’s bid 
for his third NKL. shutout' 
Washington took a 1-0 lead 
early in the first period when. 
HarJand Monahan stole the 
puck at the New York blue 
line and beat the Ranger 
goalie. John Davidson, with 
a 35-foot slap shot 
A three-goal second period, 
including the scores by Lem- 
ieux and Meehan, clinched 
the ‘Washington triumph.

leans had more support than 
any other city right from 
the start." 

In the future, Rozelle said, 
some northern city with a 
covered stadium, like Detroit 
or Seattle, might be consid- 
ered, since there would be 
no weather problem. But for 
the time being, the cities 
already used seem to have 
the edge. 

“It b3S to be a large enough 
stadium," RozeUe said, "to 
accommodate all the ticket re- 
quests we get from the clubs. 

I know this is a hard idea 
to seR. but it really is not 
the amount of money taken 
in as the number of people 
we can take care of.” 

The Superdome will seat 
76,000. The Orange Bowl in 
Miami holds SO.OOO and the 
Rose Bowl more than 100,- 
000. Other domed stadiums, 
like the Astrodome in Hous- 
ton and the new one in 
Seattle, seat fewer than 60,- 
000, but Pontiac Stadium 
outside Detroit has 80,000 
seats under an inflatable 
plastic roof.

regular-season average, was 
the offensive hero for the 
second straight gam with an- 
other 20-point performance. 
1 The Kentucky mystery has 
been Jack Givens, the lead- 
ing scorer. Givens matched 
Williams in the first half 
with 15 points and then 
failed to score a point in 
the second half. 

"This is the second 
straight game Jack has not 
scored in the second half." 
said Hall “He played just 
great in the first half, but 
getting into early foul trou- 
ble inhibied him. He pretty 
much carried us during the 
first half ” 

Unlike the Kentucky Kan- 
sas State game; Providence’s 
22d victory against nine de- 
feats was a rather stoppfiy 
played game in which the 
teams committed 37 turn- 
overs and allowed 23 steals.

MONTREAL, March 16 (UPH 
— Serge Savard’s goal at 
11:03 of the final period to- 
nigt enabled the Montreal 
Canadiens to extend their un- 
beaten streak to J4 games by 
defeating the Pittsburgh Pen- 
guins, 5-4. 

The victory was the 53d or 
the season for Montreal, a 
team record.

Students Get 
Football Honors 

Student-athletes from 23 
schools make up the aca- 
demic . all-America college- 
division football squad. "Hie 
first team of offensive and 
defensive units includes two 
students with 4.0 averages. 
They are Lawrence Brunt, an 
offensive end from Buck- 
netU, a major in civil engi- 
neering, and Gerry Heusken, 
an offensive tackle from 
Susquehanna, a student of 
English. 

The 1975 units were se-~ 
lected from among 175 nomi- 
nees and only team regulars 
with a B average (3.0 on a 
4.0 scale) or higher were 
eligible. 

Four men also were 
selected to receive National 
Collegiate post-graduate 
scholarships. They are Bill 
Hood, an offensive end from 
Delta State; Dave Geilerman, 
a linebacker from California- 
Davis; Steve Anderson, an 
offensive guard from Cheney 
State, and Chuck Peterson, a 
comer back from Wartburg. 


HOUSTON, March 16 (UP1) 
—Wait Frazier was sidelined 
with a back sprain, Earl 
Monroe was ejected from the 
game in the first period after 
throwing the ball at an offi- 
cial and the New York Knicks 
were defeated by the Houston 
Rockets, 116-111. tonight. 

The Knicks, whose chances 
for making the National 
Basketball Association play- 
offs continue to diminish, 
trailed by 18 points in the 
third period. . But Spencer 
Haywood and the reserve 
backcourt of Butch Beard 
and Jim Barnett led a late 
comeback. 

Haywood scored 35 points 
and Beard 20, their personal 
highs as Knicks. 

Monroe hit Referee Jake 
O’Donnell in the back with 
the ball after he was called 
for his second technical foul. 
Monroe became upset when, 
28 seconds earlier, O’Donnell 
called a foul on Monroe on 
a play where Calvin Murphy 
of the Rockets elbowed the 
Knick guard while driving in 
for a layup. . 

Monroe berated O'Donnell 
util the Rockets’ Ed Ratleff 
drew a foul. At that point, 
Monroe charged O’Donnell. 

When the referee turned his 
back to report two technical 
fouls he had just called on 
Monroe, the New York play- 
er tossed the ball, hitting 
O'Donnell in the lower back. 
O'Donnell, who was unin- 
jured, gave Monroe the 
thumb. Monroe had to be 
restrained from charging 
O’Donnell agai.

through Rouben 


This art-deco vignette of life 
and love in the Germany of 
1932 is as vigorous today as 
it ever was. It is one of those 
oddly perfect works of art 
where everything that has to 
come together comes togeth- 
er at the right time. It is 
tiny, sparse, succinct and 
brilliant. The dance images 
of lost lovers and even more 
lost illusions are immeasura- 
bly poignant, and Alexander 
Tansmann's lightly jazz- 
impregnated score has just 
the necessary Mittel-Euro- 
pean charm of its distance. 
• 

This is the kind of ballet 
where the choreography is 
so strong, so eloquent, that 
it is difficult, if not quite 
impossible, to be bad. But 
the Joffrey company has 
really grown to understand 
the Jooss repertory, and 
they give it with increasing 
authority. William Whitener 
is more deeply desolate than 
ever as the Young Workman 
who loses his Girl — a Cres- 
sida-like figure in a squashy 
beret, sensitively danced by 
Charthel Arthur — to the 
suavely menacing Libertine 
of Robert Thomas. What a 
pungent ballet this is — a 
cheap novelette mysteriously 
transmogrified into the 
realms of high art.

ROCKWELL 

er he was just dabbling in 
them. 

The concert ended with 
George Rochberg’s Quintet 
for Piano artel String Quartet 
(1975), written for both the 
Concordians and Jerome 
Lowers that Mr. Rochberg 
continues ' here his recent 
practice of writing whole sec- 
tions in 19th-century idioms, 
sometimes strongly remin- 
iscent of particular com- 
posers. The principal honoree 
on Monday was Brahms, es- 
pecially in a deightful Fugue- 
Scherzo. 

The Rochberg Quintet 
lasts 45 minutes (even with- 
out one exposition repeat), 
and is divided into seven 
sections, with all sorts of 
linkages between paired 
movements. How Mr. Roch- 
berg’s extreme sort of eclec- 
ticism will stand up In fu- 
ture remains very much to 
be seen. But the immediate 
effect is amusing, delightful, 
and sometimes very moving, 
particularly in those move- 
ments in which he shifts in 
and out of his tonal style. 
This work is full of dark, 
somber passages that act as 
a foil for jolly eruptions, and 
the writing for all concerned 
indicates an unusual love and 
sympathy for tbe instru- 
ments. 

Nuclear Regulatory Agency 
Opposes a Radiation Curb 

WASHINGTON, March 16 
(UPI) — The Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission mounted stiff 
opposition to a proposal to 
lower the level of radiation 
from commercial nuclear instal 
latxons that Is to be considered 
acceptable, government offi- 
cials said today. 

The Environmental Protection 
Agency has proposed that the 
total acceptable dose of radia- 
tion to any member of the 
population fm m nnrtpar power 
plants and all other commercial 
sources be no more than 25 
millimns a year.' 

This would be a reduction 
from the present minimum of 
500 miQirems, which E.P.A. of- 
ficials describe as "a holdover 
from the fallout days of the 
early 1960’s" when atmospheric 
testing of nuclear weapons still 
was common. 

The N-R-C-, which regulates 
nuclear power plants, opposed 
any change in the minimum 
at little-publicized EJP.A. hear- 
-gs last week.

We, the undersigned, are artists and friends who are dedicated to 
the survival of The American Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, 
Connecticut. To those of us who work in the theatre, The American 
Shakespeare Theatre is a very special place. It is the home of 
classical theatre in America. On April 1st, it will close its doors 
forever if you do not help. Already 70,000 school children are being 
deprived of seeing Shakespearean productions this year because 
the school season at the theatre has been cancelled. Almost 
2,000,000 of your children have seen a Shakespearean production 
at Stratford during the past 15 years. The theatre has already raised 
$150,000 towards the $300,000 needed to open its 22nd season. If 
needs your help now. It needs small contributions and large con- 
tributions. Every dollar given is tax deductible and will make it 
possible in this bicentennial year for The American Shakespeare 
Theatre to continue as a major cultural resource.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1976_ 


About NewYork 

Archivist Traces Long Green Line 


When be has completed 
jiis march up Fifth Avenue 
and across 86th Street at 
the head of the St Patrick's 
Day parade today. Governor 
■Carey, the soles of his feet 
tingling, will hurry back by 
car to the welcoming doors 
of the American Irish His- 
torical Society. 

There he will be greeted 
by Dr. Kevin CahilL _ his 
fa mily physician, old friend 
and adviser on public-health 
matters, who is also the 
president-general of the so- 
ciety. members of the execu- 
tive board, and their families. 

A nip or two will be served 
.to guard against the damp, 
-Killarney Dew for most, soft 
drinks for the kids, and white 
wine for the Governor, a 
solecism that will be excused 
in the interest of a clear 
head, the better to keep the 
state solvent, and a slender 
waistline. 

"■ Then the Governor will 
'appear on the balcony of the 
town house in which the 
'society is housed, at SDth 
.Street and Fifth Avenue, to 
encourage those still on the 
march. 

' “Hugh was the society's 
medalist last year," Dr. 
I Cahill said. “All things con- 
sidered it couldn't have been 
very surprising. He's a one- 
man Celtic renaissance. He 
and I sat in the library' last 
St. Patrick's Day while he 
' wrote the speech that he 
gave at the Friendly Sons’ 
'dinner that night/* 

Dr. Cahill, who holds a 
chair in tropical medicine at 
the College of Surgeons in 
Dublin, has made a study of 
Irish physicians who were 
i also poets, or vice versa. 

“Dr. Oliver SL John Gogar- 
' ty, whom I had the pleasure 
of knowing, seems to have 
been the last of the line, 

• I'm sorry to say." Dr. Cahill 
said. “It's a tradition that 
went back to the 1 2th centu- 

' ry, although I don't dare to 
imagine what sort of physi- 
cians they were in those 
days. Oliver Goldsmith was 
a doctor, or at least he prac- 
ticed as ore. He maintained 
that he got his medical de- 
gree in Paris, but there seems 
to have been some dispute 

• about that.” 

Tropical medicine, it was 
observed, seemed like an odd 
' specialty in cool and rainy 
Dublin. 

“True enough," he said, 
“except for the fact that 
there are more missionaries 
- —Catholic ones at any rate 
— from Ireland doing good 
. works all over the world 
than there are from the Unit- 
ed States. Most of them 
spend their time in the hot 


BUCKLEY 


places of the world and they 
return home with all sorts 
of ailments.” 

• 

Dr. William D. Griffin, the 
archivist and librarian of the 
society, which was founded 
in 1892, said that he was 
happy to see Americans of 
Irish descent taking more in- 
terest in their heritage these 
days. 

“More and more are mak- 
ing use of our library for 
research," he said. "We have 
35,000 volumes and an exten- 
sive manuscript collection, 
which is open without charge 
to serious students. Those 
who come in are more inter-* 
ested in facts than they are 
In legends. As a professor 
of history at SL John's Uni- 
versity I found that encou- 
raging. I must say." 

At the time of the Ameri- 
can Revolution, he said, re- 
plying to a question, only 
about 10 percent of the popu- 
lation of the 13 colonies 
hailed from Ireland. They 
were probably divided about 
equally between Protes- 
tants, mainly from Ulster, 
and Catholics From the south. 

“In those days they were 
more united by their grievan- 
ces against the English land- 
lords than they were divided 
by their religions," he said. 
"They thought of themselves 
as Irish, pure and simple, 
and they came here to try 
to improve their lot in life.” 

Once thev arrived, though, 
the Protestants, the so-called 
Scotch Irish, who were the 
descendants of families 
brought from Scotland to 
populate Ulster after many 
of the Catholics were driven 
out and their land confiscat- 
ed, found it easier to assimi- 
late. 

"During the colonial per- 
iod," Dr. Griffin went on. 
“Catholics were not per- 
mitted to worship openly 
here. Indeed, there was some 
sentiment after the Revolu- 
tion in favor of keeping it 
that way. John Jay, for one, 
feared the influence of the 
Pope, whom he considered a 
foreign potenate." 


Showing a iisitor. through 
the five-story mansion the 
other day, Tom Bayne, of 
the society staff, pointed out 
the Bourke Cockran Library, 
dominated by a portrait of 
the memorable politician, or- 
ator and wit for which it 
is named, the death mask 
of Wolfe Tone, and many 3 
other curios and mementos. 

"No," he said, "you don’t 
have to be Irish to join — and 
it only costs $50 a year — just 
to hare a bit of Irish in 
your soul." 


Theater: A Sea of Gags 


U.S. Family Is Subject 
of Durang’s ‘Titanic’ 


By MEL GUSSOW 

Lately, we have been vi- 
cariously quaked, sizzled and 
flooded in disaster movies — 
. “group jeopardy” pictures in 
; Hollywood parlance. In Chris- 
topher Durang’s ‘Titanic" (at 
the Direct Theater!, a play- 
wright answers back: Any 
catastrophe that can be pro- 
jected on a big screen, he 
* can make far more ridiculous 
on a small stage. 

Mr. Durang is a recent 
graduate of the Yale School 
of Drama, where he and 
; Albert F. Innaurato wrote — 
and the Yale Repertory Thea- 
ter produced — "The Idiot's 
Karamazov." an anarchic 
- travesty of Russian and 
American literature, 
a 

The target In this new solo 
broadside is not, as one 
might expect, "unsinkable" 
ships but the American fam- 
ily, as represented by a 
sexually convoluted four- 
some— rather, mother, brother 
and, maybe, sister (or is she 
the Captain’s daughter?). 

Actually the Titanic aspect 
of the show' is something of 
an excuse. Mr. Durang is not 
really concerned with hero- 
ism or cowardice, but with 
infinite sexual permutations. 
This is a wild drawing-room 
farce that happens to take 
place at sea. 

The humor is untamed, a 
nonstop flow of outrageous 
jokes, puns and burlesque 
byplays, which sets its tone 
in the opening minutes with 
the mother’s comment. 
"They’re playing our fiong." 
The song. "Nearer My God 
to Thee,” is premature. This 
Titanic is a long, long way 
from sinking. The ship can’t 
seem to find that iceberg, 
just as the author can’t seem 
to decide when to end his 
play; he keeps postponing the 
inevitable. 

Cut to an hour, this ship 
would float. Now- it bobbles 
along as a sea of gags. It is 
not so much a play as an ex- 
tended routine, but Mr. Du- 
rang has a ferocious comic 
talent, and his company of 
actors, breathlessly deployed 
by Peter Mark Schifter, is 
thoroughly Durangian. 

Characters are always 
flaunting secrets, boasting 
fetishes and unmasking true 
identities (later to be re- 
placed by alternate identi- 
ties). The mother, in a pique, 
tells the father that their 
child Teddy (a young adult

in knee pants), is not really 
his son. The father, in a 
panic, tells her that their 
child Annabel la is not reaily 
her daughter. Long pause 
... as the mother thinks it 
over, then says, “Nonsense!" 

In this show, nonsense is 
titanic (and one might re- 
verse that phrase). The most 
bizarre creature is the would- 
be daughter (who is also an 
aunt who is having an affair 
with her sister when she 
isn't seducing her nephew). 
This oversexed nymp'net is 
played in miniskirt by the 
lovely, long-limbed Sigourney 
Weaver. whose unabashed 
good nature makes us laugh 
at the most indelicate situa- 
tions. 


The actors, some of whom 
have worked with the author 
at Yale, run madly, at a tilt, 
through this tiny ’Titanic": 
Stefan Hartman, Richard Pe- 
terson, Jeff Brooks, Ralph 
Redpath and Kate McGregor- 
StewarL As the shifty 
mother. Miss McGregor- 
S tew art gives a particularly 
droll and zany performance. 

’Titanic" plays at 11 P.M. 
on weekends at the Direct 
Theater, and is clearly a late- 
night diversion. Mr. Durang 
stands everything on its 
head, utilizing what might be 
called the Poseidon approach 
. to comedy.

By JOHN RUSSELL 

Not since Custer's last 
stand has there been any- 
thing quite as courageous in 
its way as ‘‘200 Years of 
American Sculpture" at the 
Whitney Museum oF Ameri- 
can Art This is the Whit- 
ney’s particular contribution 
to the Bicentennial celebra- 
tions, and it has been made 
possible by very substantial 
grants from the Chase Man- 
hattan Bank and the Na- 
tional Endowment for the 
. Arts. Thus far, thus respecta- 
ble: thereafter lies the jungle. 

For nobody knows what 
American sculpture is. There 
is a certain general disposi- 
tion to believe that until 
David Smith there was no 
such thing. But this belief, if 
upheld, would leave us with 
a blank for 170 of ibe 200 
years in question. Within 
that blank, many pockets of 
specialized interest would 
hold out. It cannot be by- 
chance that certain great 


American writers turned to 
sculpture and not to paint- 
ing as the locus of their 
deepest feelings. What did 
Nathaniel Hawthorne write 
about? ''The Marble Faun." 
What did Henry James's hero 
Roderick Hudson do? He 
sculpted. Whose biography 
did James write? A sculp- 
tor's: William Wetmore 

Story. Sculpture is part of 
the American imagination, 
and it was high time that 
someone sought it out, dis- 
entangled it and laid out the 
skeins one by one for us all 
to look over. 

• 

The task was not beyond 
any one institution, but it 
was beyond any one man or 
woman. Seven people were 
involved m the Whitney ex- 
hibition, and the terrain they 
had to cover ranged from so- 
called "aboriginal art" 
through American folk art to 
the monumental sculpture 
that was fostered by a young 
nation that couldn't bear not 


to be memorialized. There- 
after came the first stirrings 
of the modern movement, the 
great explosion of the un- 
conscious between 1930 and 
1950, and the art of our 
own time, in which tolerance 
has no limits and a hisioricist 
view of art gives a universal 
franchise to activities that 
until lately would have 
earned nothing but ridicule. 
The question “What is sculp- 
ture?” now provokes the an- 
swer “Everything that isn’t 
painting”; and even then the 
Whitney show includes things 
that are flat and come 
framed and bang on the wail. 

How to carve up this erfor- 
mous subject? How to set the 
archetypal tobacco-store In- 
dian beside an inspirational 
scattering of ball bearings 
and black felt by Barry L Va?

side a piece by Keith Son- 
nier, which can be broken

Met to Show Art Treasures of Ireland 


; Art treasures of Ireland — 
Celtic manuscripts and ob- 
jects of art that date from 
the Bronze Age to the 1 5th 
century and that have never 
been seen in -the United 
States— will go on display at 
the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art in 1977. 

Thomas P. F. Hoving, the 
Metropolitan's director, said 
yesterday that 60 objects 
would be exhibited in the 
Metropolitan and other Amer- 
ican museums. 

: Significant pieces of the 
exhibition include the Book 
of Kells, an eighth-century 
manuscript noted for its in- 
terlace decoration and ab- 
straction of human and ani- 
mal forms, and the Book of 
Dnrrow, another important 
example of manuscript deco- 
ration. 

•The 1,200-year-old Ardagh 
Chalice of silver, enamel, 
glass and bronze gilt, is con- 
s illered to be the most per- 
fectly preserved such object 
surviving from the Middle 
Ages, is also to be included. 

Other objects include bells 
and bdl shrines, the silver, 
gdld and enamel Tara 
Brooch, book shrines and 
reliquaries. 

: During the viking inva- 


sions from about 800 to 1020. 
these Celtic treasures along 
with many others were usu- 
ally hidden underground. 
Many of them did not sur- 
face until the 19th century. 

Ireland’s Minister of Edu- 


cation. Richard Burke, said 
the exhibition should make 
a ‘‘notable contribution to a 
happier and truer image of 
Ireland than the one too 
often propagated at the pres- 
ent time."

jVO DANUBE BLUES 
There are some surprises a: 
thg Emke Hungarian Restau- 
rant (650-9324 and 9357), on 
Second Avenue just south of 
7Sth Street, where the win- 
dow sign advertises a gypsy 
band nightly. Three musicians 
were on duty last Saturday 
around midnight, clad in 
traditional white shirts and 
red vests. A pianist played in 
the rear comer by a wide, 
brightly lighted scarlet cur- 
tain: next to him a seated 
colleague cradled a flat cim- 
balom. The third player was 
a strolling violinist. 

There was instant hospi- 
tality at the entrance, where 
the 'attendant by the open 
coat rack (who looked a bit 
like Katharine Cornell), smil- 
ingly directed a guest a bar 
thronged with Hungarian- 
speaking patrons. This is a 
friendly, informal place with 
a distinct Middle European 
flavor, as voices at the bar 
and tables sing along with the 
music. You don't expect this 
ambience somehow even in 
Yorkville, amidst new. Amer- 
ican-style niteries catering to 
young people. 

From the bar (an anisette 
was SI. 73) the native music 
sounded sentimental and dis- 
tinctly gypsy. Then the exotic 
mist cleared for a familiar- 
sounding tango, an Eartha 
Kitt tune and "la Vie En 
Rose." "I Wish You Love" 
and "Misty." 

THE RECORD "Image Be- 
fore My Eyes: A Photo- 
graphic History of Jewish 
Life in Poland (1864-1939)” 


is today's new exhibition at 
the Jewish Museum, 1 109 
Fifth Avenue (at 92d Street). 
It will be on view through 
Sept. 5 and includes 400 
black-and-white prints as- 
sembled by the YIVO Insti- 
tute for Jewish Research. 

The display is intended, ac- 
cording to the museum, as 
a camera chronicle "in con- 
trast to the nostalgic presen- 
tations of piety and poverty 
of East European Jewry” 
that "captures the confron- 
tation between Polish Jewry 
and modernity'." The three- 
part exhibition depicts tra- 
ditional religious life, histor- 
ical events and the spectrum 
of Jewish life in the modem 
ora. 

The pictures have come 
from various sources to YIVO, 
the only scholarly institution 
in the United States dedi- 
cated exclusively to the study 
of Eastern European Jewish 
culture. Some of the photo- 
graphs were recovered after 
World War n, others were 
donated by Americans of 
Polish descent- 

Also represented are family 
snapshots, studio portraiti. 
the work of noted profession- 
al photographers and contri- 
butions from relief organi- 
zations, newspapers and 
other groups. 

In keeping with the pic- 
ture display, the museum is 
having a Sunday series of 
films and lectures, starting 
this Sunday at 3 P.M. with 
“The Dybbuk" (1938), fea- 
turing the Warsaw Art Play- 
ers.

Daniel Chester French and 
others tried to come to terms 
with the history of their 
young nation? Look at it how 
you will, it was a suicidal as- 
signment 

• 

However, collective respon- 
sibility takes the heat off the 
obituary columns: and what 
the Whitney has done is to 
set up seven quite separate 
exhibitions that form up as 
an impersonation of the ba- 
zaars of Damascus by the 
skills of the designers,' Rob- 
ert Venturi and John Rauch. 
One could dissent in detail 
from much of what results: 
but at least the show gets up. 
and it makes some sort of | 
sense, and it gives the en- 
quiring visitor a glimpse of 
most of the major names. 
The catalogue was ready on 
time, too: with 350 pages, 
more than 400 illustrations, 
and an illustrated “Who’s 
Who" that is in itself a con- 
tinuous entertainment, it is 
cheap at $15. plus 75 cents 
postage. 

And then it’s a great sub- 
ject overall: nothing less 
than the impact of the third j 
dimension upon American life i 
from the time that the first 
mask was found in Le Flore 
County, Okla. (No one knows | 
quite when it was made.) | 
There's a glorious freedom 
and exuberance about the | 
figure of Henry Howard, j 
chief of the Volunteer Fire I 
Department, which for so I 
many years stood on top of ; 
Firemen's Hall at 155 Mercer j 
Street and was later acquired 
by the sculptor Elie Nadel- 
nian. And how much of Saul 
Steinberg is foreshadowed in ! 
the figure of a tinsmith that I 
for so manv years lorded it • 
in Brooklyn! j 

Anyone who is sensitive to : 
the quirks and quiddities of 
American life will love this J 
show. There is a new primi- ; 
tive. James Hampton, who is . , 
well up m the class of Sam ; i 
Rodia. the fabricator of the 
Watts Towers. There is a 
carousel rooster that makes j 
us step out more briskly 1 
even if nothing is further 1 
from our intentions. There J 
are reminders that the found- j 
er of the Museum. Gertrude i 
Vanderbilt Whitney, was her- j 
self a sculptor. The exhibi- 
tion runs on a very long 
leash: one that allows it to 
take in monumental sculp- 
ture, the heyday of the pan- 
ther-and -stallion men. the 
first brief flush of American | 
modernism, the carry-over of j 
abstract Expressionism into • 
sculpture, the tableaux vi- i ! 
vants of the I960’s and the ] 
activity of our own decade, i 1 
which works as much with | 
space as with mass and as : 
much with the great outdoors i 
as with the finite areas of the ] 
studio and the dealer's gal- 
iery. j 

Each of the seven sections ' 
is prefaced by a short but ‘ 
cogent text We get to see a 1 
lot of good pieces (some j 
familiar, some not). There's ! 1 
a bit of everything, more or : 
less. Open-mindedness is ■ 
doubtless a good thing. But | 
comprehensiveness has its ! 
price. It means for instance j 
that we never see a career in ; 
depth. (It also has its limits. ! 
There is nothing by Raoul 1 
Hague, for instance, though ! 
Hague is certainly the equal ! 
of many sculptors who are I 
represented. Nor does the I 
Whitney include Alex Hay's f 
giant paper bag. though' it ! 
belongs to the museum and i 
is one of the most aristocratic j 
art objects of the last 15 j : 
years). 

The sheer bulk of the show 
means that many pieces — j 
Barnett Newman's "Here I” J 
( i 950) for one — have no : 
room to live their own life. ] 
No non professions I could l 
possibly adapt to so much, so : 
fast. But then no one is com- { 
pelled to read straight i 
through an encyclopedia, 
either; and wnai this show- 
offers is a first shol, at an 
encyclopedia of American 
sculpture. Go see!

Dr. .Mario Enrique Jasca* 
rieiicii, the su?pect in the case 
'of the ‘'unusual or unexplained” 

I deaths at Riverdeli Hospital a 
. decade ago, was bom in Buenos 
Aires on Aug. 27, J927, and 
was graduated from medical 
school there in 1954. 

But the slightly built surgeon 
has spent virtually -all of his 
: professional career in nonhem 
•New Jersey, including four 
; years in the mid- 1960‘s aL Riv- 
erdell. 

According lo testimony that 
Dr. Jascalevich gave in 1966. 
his father, Enrque, was of ^ 

Yugoslav background and his J 

•mother of lialian ancestry. 

‘Mario Jascalevich was brought 
up in the "Italian quarter” of 
Buenos Aires and entered Bue- 
nos Aires Medical School in 
IMS. 

! Tv.o years after he gradu- 
ated from medical school — his 
hesis was on the development 
of the liver— Dr. Jascalevich 
came to the United State*; to 
■ take an internship at Passaic 
General Hospital. 

In 1956 Dr. Jascalevich began 
i four-year surgical residency 
at New 'York Polyclinic Medical 
Echool and Hospital. 350 West 
50th Street; when he completed 
the residency he joined the 
staff of Christ Hospital In Jer- 
sey City as chief surgical resi- 
dent. 

Has New York License 

Dr. Jascalevich received his 
medical license in New Jersey 
on July 12. 1961, three months 
after becoming a naturalized 
American citizen. The surgeon 
also has a license to practice 
in New York State but has ap- j 
parentiy made little, if any, use V 
■of it. 

On Jan. 20. 1962, in West 
; New York. N. J.. Dr. Jascale- 
vich married Nora Caperan. a

hospital and Dr. Jascalevich was : 
named chairman, of the surgical; 
department, or chief surgeon. ‘ 

In the summer of 1965 a sec-' 
ond surgeon — Dr. Robert Briski 
—was added to the staff and. 
the following February Dr. Stan-. 

ley Harris began his affiliauon 

with the hospital, which now 
has SI beds. 

Dr. Jascalevich was generally 
regarded as the hospital as a 
fast, superb surgeon. But appar-. 
ently he aiso had some difficult- 
ies at the institution in 1965 
and 1966. According to hospital, 
records and testimony given 
during the original curare inves- 
tigation in November 1966, Dr.; 
Jascalevich was admonished for 
endangering the hospital's ac- 
creditation by failing to call 
meetings of the surgical depart- ■ 
mem and for not giving ade- 
quate coverage at the hospital 
when he was considered needed. 

Resigned in I9C7 
Dr. Jascj!e\it.ii resigned iron' 
the hospital in February, 1967. 
The minuu.-s of the meeting dc 
not state any reason for th? 
resignation, "but Dr. Jascale- 
vich*-; lawyer. James Ander/an. 
plained to Riveideli > directors 
said yesterday that he haa coni- 
fer their -bud treatment" of 
his client. 

Il was the hospital’s duec- 
tors who initiated the origins 1 

curare inquiry after the drag 
• was found by" Dr. Harris in Dr. 
Jascalevich' s' locker. 

In 1963. wnen he was a lec- 
turer in ih-* anatomy depart- 
ment at Seton Hall Medical 
School. Dr. Jascalevich had a 
S500 grant to develop a new 
r\pe of stomach feeding tube. 
About $300 of the research 
fund-; were used to purchase 
12 dogs for experimentation. 
However, curare was not used 
in this research, according to. 
Dr. Jascalevich. 

- The surgeon testified in 1966 
that he had nought curare for- 
additional experiments ih3t he- 
wanted ro <J«i in 1965 and 1955.

"ULTRA EROTIC! 

...Radley Metzger’s The Image' is a faithful, ultra-erotic adaptation of ‘L'lnaace’ 
a r reach sex novel written pscudonvmously by one Jean de Berg, who presumably 
bore some literary kinship to “Story of OV mysterious author. Pauline Reage... if 
anything. Mc-tzger improves on the book by deepening and broadening even its most 
explicit sequences with meticulous photography, stylistic cool and a fine sense of the 
kinky sexual power struggle between S/UPs dominant masters and their not-so- 
iimocenl slaves. The film's enticing cast is led by Carl Parker... best known as the 
supermacho male chauvinist in that Silva Thins television commercial. Opposite 
Parker are stage actresses Marilyn Roberts and Marv Mcndum.f •

Bridge: 


S of the New York Teams 
Still in Vanderbilt Play 


By ALAN TRUSCOTT 



special tsTbe 

KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 
16 — Five New York teams 
were in play this afternoon 
in the fourth round of the 
Vanderbilt knockout team 
championship at the Ameri- 
can Contract Bridge League’s 

S iring Nationals, two of 
em after surviving cliff- 
hangers in the early hours 
of this morning. 

Prophets hhd picked two 
third-round matches as likely 
to be dose, and they were 
completely vindicated. Sam 
Stayman and Matt Granovet- 
ter of New York, with four 
young East Coast experts, 
won their 64-deal match by 
exactly one international 
match point against a four- 
some headed by Lou Reich of 
Waltham, Mass., and includ- 
ing Ira Rubin of Paramus, 
N. J. 

Another match was even 
closer. Kathie Wei of New 
York, teamed with three 
Midwestern experts, ended 
in an exact tie against a 
quartet led by Kathie Cap- 
pelletti of Alexandria, Va. 
After an eight-deal playoff 
both teams thought they had 
lost. Mrs. Wei was happy to 
find that her team had mis- 
calculated the score, and she 
had won by one point. 

Other New York teams 
surviving were: Bill Roberts, 
who won by 24 points 
against fourth-seeded John 
Fejervaty of Palo Alto, Calif.; 
Edgar Kaplan, who beat 
Dale Maxwell of Stillwater, 
Okla., by 102, and George 
Rapee. winner by 64 points 
against Jack Wolf of Mis- 
souri City, Tex. The United 
States women's international 
team, scheduled to play for 
the world women’s team title 
in Monte Carlo in May, lost 
by 14 points to Doug Hill of 
Nashville. 

At the halfway mark in the 
fourth round, the standings 
were: Di*. George Rosenkranz 
of Mexico City, the defending 
champion, led Hill by 64 
points; Kit Woofsey of Arling- 
ton, Va., led the Aces by 17; 
Roberts led Mrs. Wei by 29; 
Kaplan was ahead of 'Lew 
Mathe of Los Angeles by 6 
points; Bud Reinhold of Palm 
Beach, Fla., led Stayman by 
25: Gaylor Kasle of Tucson, 
Ariz., trailed Richard Free- 
man of Atlanta by 1; Malcolm 
Brachman of Dallas led David 
Macaslan of Louisville, Ky., 
by 22, and Rapee was ahead 
c'f Ron Smith of SL Louis by 
58 do in is. 

There was an element of 
irony in the diagramed deal 
from a third-round match, 
and the members of the Rein- 


KwYnt Haws 

hold team appreciated it 
more than their suffering op- 
ponents. Five diamonds is 
hopeless, and duly failed 
when it was attempted. But 
hopeless, and duly"' failed 
when it was attempted. But 
six diamonds is far from 
hopeless, and succeeded. 

In both rooms, the bidding 
followed the same course up 
to a point. South opened one 
diamond. West crowded the 
auction with four clubs, with 
the vulnerability In his favor. 
And North tried four hearts. 
East was looking forward to 
defending the contract, but 
South retreated to five dia- 
monds.

diamonds was that his part- 
ner held the spade ace. 

But in the replay Lou 
Bluhra of Atlanta took a stab 
at six diamonds with the 
North hand. West again led 
the club ace, but now he had 
a choice. Needing, onlv one 
more trick, he continued with 
a second dub. hoping that 
his partner had begun with 
a singleton club and could 
overruff the dummy. 

This defense was fatal, and 
left East wishing that he had 
bid four spades over four 
hearts. The declarer. Andy 
Bernstein of Nashville, won 
the club continuation in his 
hand, drew trumps in one 
round, and set about estab- 
ishing hearts. Dummy’s 
trumps furnished entries, ana 
he was able to discard all 
his spade losers to make the 
slam. This gave the Reinhold 
team 16 international match 
points, a somewhat fortunate 
result of bidding a slam with 
two aces missing.

SWEET WIEtMM. By Bcrul Bainbridge. 204 
poxes. George Brmilter,'S7.05. 

While the word romance once suggested 
the idealization of love, it has now come 
to connote its unpredictability. Love as a 
dare, a blind fling at unconscious feelings. 
Love as a high, laced with danger and 
humiliation. The lover’s leap into dizzying 
possibility, love as main chance, last 
chance, double or nothing. Love as a de- 
liberate' contradic- 
tion of one's disap- 
pointing self, as 
exasperated nar- 
cissism. as sexual 
tantrum. 

This is how 
Beryl Bain bridge 
sees it in '‘Sweet 
William." * Ann 
Walton has- - a 
fianri who guar- 
antees her a 
lifetime secure 
against surprise. 

When Gerald ac- 
cepts a teaching 
job in America, 
she settles back 
to wait for him Beryl Bainbridge 
to send for her. 

Her life stretches out before her like a 
domestic conversation in a foreign lan- 
guage grammar — until William picks her 
up at a church fair. 

Ann is so hollow that, whatever his in- 
tentions might have been, William has no . 
choice but to fill her up. H!s is, anyway, 
the sort of personality that habitually 
slops over. Immediately, they go to bed, 
and, in a single image. Miss Bainbridge 
shows us the character and quality .of 
their affair; when they* make love, Ann 
keeps catching his ankle bone with her 
toenail. "Must cut them, she thought.” 

‘Important and Extended* 

Loving William, Miss Bainbridge ob- 
serves, makes Ann feel "important and 
extended.” She learns to lie, to hate, to 
believe, to deceive herself — all kinds of 
new tricks. As a lover, William is rather 
a Rorschach blot: he could mean anything. 
For example, when he gives Ann a fur 
coat, it is so ineffably ambiguous, ' so - 
equidistant between real and fake fur, that 
you wonder whether he has done it on 
purpose, chosen it with great precision 
for that very reason, to keep Ann in doubt, 
to conceal his true intentions. Is the coat 
an extravagant gift from a poor man or 
a patronizing one from a richer man? 

When Ann gets pregnant, William buys 
her a pram in her third or fourth month, 
forces her to wheel it up and down her 
tiny living room, to rock it It turns out 
that William has a wife. When we learn 


• that her name is Edna, we know that she 
is the tool of fate. Edna appears at Ann’s 
-apartment in green ballet slippers, looks 
askance at Ann with her chin on her left 
shoulder. At one point, while both of them 
are crying over William. Edna stoops down 
to test the brakes on the pram. 

Edna's first visit to Ann takes place on 
her own birthday, and William sends a 
birthday cake to Ann’s flat Edna gravely 
, cuts it and insists that Ann eat a piece. 
William has other women, too. When Ann 
inquires about the nature of these ac- 
quaintances, William’s voice grows husky, 
but she cannot tell whether it is with emo- 
tion for her, for them, or as a result of his 
suppressing yawns. William dictates his 
wife’s letters to Ann and Ann’s letters to 
Gerald. Of her loneliness. Edna is made to 
say: "The nights are so long, the sentence 
so savage!” Tt is also conceivable that Wil- 
liam Is sincere, in his own way; sincere in 
every direction. 

Ann’s conversations with him alternate 
between accusation and caution. She 
wants to make William feel guilty enough 
to reform but not enough to leave. She 
tries to accept his. excuses when he fails 
to show up and comes round only the next 
morning, but he always leaves out one or 
two elements in an otherwise plausible 
story. 

Accusation and Caution 

Ann has a masochistic habit of confiding 
in her mother. "William loves me,” she 
says. "He really does.” "You need more 
than love my girl.” her mother replies. 
"When you were bom, 1 lost all my. teeth.” 
She has passpd her life, Mrs. Walton 
says, peeling potatoes for the wrong man; 
her daughter is the modem equivalent. 
Ann’s landlady. Mrs. Kershaw, is like a 
more permissive mother; if she were not 
so fond of lending William her bicycle, 
Ann muses, he might be monogamous. 
Ann’s father keeps his arms crossed on 
his chest to -prevent her from seizing one 
or slipping into them. 

Miss Bainbridge’s books are so bleak 
that one would think she- could win a wide 
audience in. America, where bleakness in 
fiction is taken to be the hallmark of 
profundity. Perhaps her savage wit works 
against her. American women are trying 
to give up being the butt of the joke, and 
the hygienic effect of “Sweet William” 
may be lost on them. 

Apart from its retrograde politics, 
“Sweet William” is quite a good novel. 
Its only apparent flaw lies in its last line, 
which has already been singled out by ad- 
vance publicity for praise. It has to do with 
the shape of an Infant's nose, and according 
to reliable obstetrical information, normal 
newborn babies cannot have beaked 
noses, '

Exit, Harold Wilson 

In announcing his intention to step down as Britain's 
Prime Minister and Labor Party leader, Harold Wilson 
described the achievements of his four Governments 
and projected Britain's economic outlook in inevitably 
hyperbolic terms. 

He cited valid indications that Britain’s long-ailing 
economy is beginning at last to turn slowly upwards; 
but he omitted the fact that he is the Prime Minister 
who had to preside over an unprecedented decline of 
the British pound — to an astonishing low of $1.92 Only 
last week. 

He claimed for his administrations the achievement 
of “a higher level of social justice and equality than our 
people has ever known”; but he neglected to say that 
many of those gains have been eroded by one of the 
worst inflation rates in Europe. 

Mr. Wilson says the Government’s counterinflation 
policies — which necessitated scrapping much of Labor's 
social and economic program — “have been accepted by 
the great majority of the nation”; but he fails to add 
that the Government’s plan to slash public spending 
by $3.4 billion in four years was defeated only last 
week in Commons — with the help of a diehard left-wing 
faction of his own party. 

In his tendency to pass off appearance as substance 
and in his fascination for precedents, records and fig- 
ures, Mr. Wilson’s style is reminiscent of that of Richard 
M. Nixon. Thus, his announcement points out not only 
that he has been Prime Minister longer than any peace- 
time predecessor in this century, but that he answered 
more than 12,000 questions in Commons, addressed an 
average of 100 political meetings a year and read an 
average of 500 official documents per weekend. 

Mr. Wilson’s administrations have by no means been 
devoid of accomplishments; and he deserves much of the 
credit for leading the Labor Party back to power in 
1964 after thirteen years in the wilderness and again 
into office In 1974 against heavy odds. Indeedi if his 
Cabinet was not “the most experienced and talented 
team in this century," as he claims, it has been, minister 
for minister, superior to the Conservative Government 
it replaced two years ago. 

* * * 

A good deal of Mr. Wilson’s comportment, in office 
and out, can be explained by his obsession at all cost 
to hold together the disparate elements that make up 
the Labor Party. That overriding objective, arising from 
the deep wounds inflicted on the party by J. Ramsay 
Macdonald’s venture into coalition government in the 
1930’s, goes far to explain Mr. Wilson’s backing and 
filling on issues, his passion for balance in his appoint- 
ments, and his unwillingness to have a definitive show- 
down with Labor’s unruly left wing. * 

At substantial cost to his reputation and his record, 
Mr. Wilson has been able to keep Government and 
party together during trying times and to outmaneuver 
both his Tory opposition and his own left wing when 
it was necessary. He solidified Britain’s membership of 
the European Community over left-wing opposition by 
resorting to an unprecedented national referendum on 
the issue which many still believe was incompatible 
with the parliamentary system. 

He kept Britain firmly inside the NATO alliance 
despite left-wing sniping and the economic necessity 
for severe defense budget cuts; he maintained an influ- 
ential British role in a rapidly changing Commonwealth 
of Nations, and be preserved a relationship with the 
United States which remains special, despite all the 
attempts to downgrade it 

Whoever is elected by the Labor Members of Parlia- 
ment to take over the reins of Government and party 
from Harold Wilson — be his name Healey, Callaghan or 
Jenkins — is likely soon to discover that these were 
considerable achievements after all. 

F.B.I. Guidelines 

Attorney General Levi has issued a set of written 
guidelines designed to govern sensitive activities of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. In some areas, the 
guidelines represent a clear improvement over previous 
practice; in others, as Congressional critics have rushed 
to point out, they fail to provide sufficiently clear safe- 
guards against some particularly disturbing F.B.I. abuses 
of the past Their basic defect is that they do not have the 
force of law: they are merely administrative regulations, 
subject to amendment or recision at will by the execu- 
tive branch. 

The two areas where clear improvements have been 
made are in preventive action and White House investiga- 
tions. After rethinking his initial views, the Attorney 
General decided that the F.B.I. should not be authorized 
to undertake preventive programs, other than those 
which the law-enforcement agencies are normally per- 
mitted to carry out in the ordinary course of their 
operations. 

Thus, the authorization blanket under which COIN- 
TELPRO abuses occurred has been largely eliminated. 
And the new limitations on White Honse inquiries would 
abolish some of the most flagrant misuses of the 
FJ3J. committed by President Ford’s three immediate 
predecessors. 

Yet there remain large and legitimate causes for 
concern. Though preventive programs are not authorized, 
they are not specifically prohibited either. Moreover, 
some of the guidelines on domestic security investiga- 
tions seem open to interpretations which could impinge 
sharply on the freedom of speech, of association and 
of protest. , 

The Justice Department insists that those provisions 
are aimed at terrorism and that they have been carefully 
drafted to tie the activities to the use of violence and 
the violation of Federal law. The danger, however, is

that administrative interpretations of the language might 
broaden It to cover activities such as the passionate, 
but nonviolent, protests conducted as part of the antiwar 
and civil rights movements of recent years or the pro- 
tests around United Nations missions concerning human 
rights issues abroad. 

The department bas been open in developing these 
guidelines and has. responded in important measure' to 
the debate it has deliberately engendered. The -process 
has resulted In real advances in some areas. It has 
also seryed to sharpen a number of the issues involved 
in limiting EBJ. activities. Its greater value, however, 
has been to dramatize the importance of the work 
now being done in the Senate Intelligence Committee 
and the urgency for the Congress as a whole to enact 
legislation which would be more effective than adminis- 
trative orders in maintaining a viable FJLL while safe- 
guarding the liberties of American citizens. 


Democracy in D.C. 

Three-quarters of a million American citizens living 
together in one jurisdiction in the continental United 
States have no voting representation in Congress. They 
are the residents of the District of Columbia, who 
currently have only a nonvoting delegate in the House 
of Representatives and no representation whatsoever in 
the Senate. 

The House today will vote on a proposed constitu- 
tional amendment which would provide Congressional 
representation for the district. Full approval of the 
amendment requires affirmative votes by two-thirds of 
the members of the House and the Senate and ratifi- 
cation by three-quarters of the states. 

The carefully drafted proposition is not designed to 
turn the District of Columbia into a state, but merely 
to give its residents a meaningful vote and the same 
representation in Congress the rest of us have. Congress 
ought to approve this resolution quickly and give the 
states the opportunity to affirm— as part of their 
Bicentennial celebrations — the proposition that this 
Republic still opposes taxation without representation. 


‘Quality Zoning* ... 

New York City has long suffered not only from 
inadequate housing, but also from as poorly designed 
housing as that of any major city in the world. 

The Housing Quality zoning amendment, now before 
the Board of Estimate, offers a carefully studied alterna- 
tive to the standard pedestrian formula. It spells out a 
series of desirable amenities that cannot be achieved 
under present zoning restrictions: greater flexibility in 
plot coverage, lower buildings more compatible with 
certain neighborhoods, better apartment layouts and 
room sizes, provision of sunlight, security, and recre- 
ation areas. 

Whether or not a developer elects to build in this 
manner is completely optional; this legislation is not 
mandatory. Designing this way could he cheaper, as well 
as better, than the conventional way, once zoning makes 
it possible. Indeed, in many cases substantial savings 
could result 

An immediate benefit would be to make smaller, 
currently unusable sites profitable for housing, where 
present zoning requires large assemblages and towers. 
And there are other advantages for the builder. With 
housing projects increasingly subject to community 
board review, Housing Quality standards could be an 
expediting ally. 

Those who don’t want to be bothered with an improved 
alternative are free to continue building as badly as they 
want to. All the legislation really offers is opportunity. 
With New York’s problems, the city at least deserves a 
break in the way it lives; this provides a way to better 
housing with no cost to anyone and profit to alL 


. . . Revitalizing the City 

Construction, the traditional index of a city's pros- 
perity, means jobs, business and revenues. But beyond 
employment and building trade statistics, it is an 
instrument of revitalization. The right building in the 
right place becomes a catalyst for key areas and 
activities. 

The announced reconstruction of the Commodore as 
a new hotel — one of the first projects under the city's 
investment incentive tax-abatement program — will bring 
back to life and health a building that is currently in 
tax arrears and threatened with closing. The plan to 
combine the concession with a protit-sharing arrange- 
ment for the city keeps it from being a giveaway or a 
windfall. What clearly justifies such action is the 
property’s pivotal importance, in these uncertain times, 
to the future of midtown. 

But the project offers more than the obvious economic 
boost. As part of the arrangement, the developer would 
contribute substantially to cleaning and restoring the 
neighboring Grand Central Terminal. This fusion of land- 
mark upgrading and property revitalization, can be a 
potent tool for urban improvement in a broad and 
lasting sense. 

Another revitalizing project currently in the planning 
stage is the reconstruction of the S. Klein buildings on 
Union Square as a new department store to serve the 
surrounding residential and business area. With a 
refurbished park, improved traffic patterns and a wide 
neighborhood appeal, the proposal could restructure 
an entire section of the city. 

Building projects like these involve the quality of the 
city as well as its economic future. With both at stake, 
this kind of construction could make a significant 
difference to New York. 




Letters to the Editor 

CUNY: Of Furloughs, Research and Layoffs 


tmm 




To the Editor: 

I want to draw your attention to a 
disturbing remark made by Alfred A. 
Giardino, c hair man of the Board erf 
Higher Education. In discussing “pay- 
less furloughs,” Mr. Giardino, in an 
open letter to the faculty dated March 
3, allowed himself a claim which is 
both preposterous and alarming. I say 
this without prejudice to the overrid- 
ing issue of whether, faced with the 
various choices forced on us, a “pay- 
less furlough” would or would not be 
the lesser evil. I do not say that it is 
or that it is necessary or even toler- 
able. 1 only say that even If it is, an 
assumption Giardino makes in connec- 
tion with it is intolerable and would 
not be made by anyone who had the 
least understanding of higher educa- 
tion. 

Giardino says that, “contrary to 
rumor-mongers,” if we are to have a 
payiess furlough it would occur during 
a period in “which employees would 
not work.” That is to say, it would 
occur during a period in which the 
faculty was not actually teaching. But 
this equation of work with teaching 
is illegitimate and completely blind to 
the reality of what it is to be a pro- 
fessor in a university. Professors 
should and indeed must do research. 
They cannot survive in the system 
without it, for tenure and promotion 
require it Given the increased teach- 
ing load in the City University, sus- 
tained research must increasingly be 
done primarily during the periods 
when lectures are not occurring. This 
research is also an integral part of 
a professor's work. It is a pitiful sub- 
terfuge to say that this period, when 
lecturing is not going on, is not work 
time and thus it would not be so evil 
not to pay the faculty when they are 
not working. This is work time, and the 
failure to see that is to fail to under- 
stand what a university is. It is a sad 
commentary on our intellectual culture 
when such ignorance obtains in the 
Board of Higher Education. One is 


African Realities 

To the Editor: 

The exceedingly unrealistic Ameri- 
can policies toward Africa are becom- 
ing more and more pronounced. As the 
Soviets and their Cuban levies tramp 
through the vastness of Angola, and 
carry on their provocative gestures to 
other regions of the African subcon- 
tinent, they are met with little opposi- 
tion in the American Government 

While it can be argued that the U.S. 
policy did envisage the support of the 
non-Soviet Angolan factions, that is 
now a moot historical point. Reality 
is such that the victory went to the 
M.P.LA., thus putting the Soviets in 
an advantageous position in that stra- 
tegic, mineral-rich territory. 

Currently we are again witness to 
the open Communist threats in both 
South-West Africa and Rhodesia. Sup- 
plies, training and encouragement to 
the anti-government forces in both 
those territories come from the Com- 
munist world. It is my impression that 
the majority of the American Congress 
seems too bothered by "more impor- 
tant" matters to consider the fate 
of these two areas. While many people 
claim that our Africa policies are 
bankrupt (and they are) we also hear 
that we can only lose by taking the 
appropriate moves .toward thwarting 
further Communist inroads. On the 


inclined to say that they are either 
knaves or fools or, to give it the most 
favorably reading, they do not know 
the slightest thing about higher edu- 


cation.

Brooklyn, March 9, 1976 


To the Editor: 

it is clear that Chancellor Robert J. 
Kibbee’s proposal to scale down the 
size or the City University of New 
York because of financial exigencies 
is painful but needed surgery. The 
Board of Higher Education is currently 
reviewing the Chancellor’s recom- 
mendations for the restructuring of 
the CUNY system and the consolida- 
tion of programs within the university. 

Unfortunately, the Chancellor's pro- 
posal is totally silent about the 
disposition or transfer of affected 
faculty. Some of these college profes- 
sors have served the university faith- 
fully for as long as thirty years, and 
many are tenured members of the 
’university. Are they simply to be in- 
formed at the end -of the spring 
semester that their academic careers 
are terminated or will the Chancellor 
and the board face their responsibili- 
ties to the faculty in an orderly and 
humane way that would take 
advantage of their talents in other 
units of the university where they 
might be effectively employed? 

The American Association of Uni- 
versity Professors has already informed 
the Chancellor that his retrenchment 
proposals of last year, as they pertain 
to faculty, are unfair and unaccept- 
able. Is CUNY to suffer the final 
degradation of censure by the national 
university community? Let us hope not 
and that reason, justice and humanity 
will prevail. But time is running out

Nuclear ‘Double-Talk’ 

To the Editor: 

The Tunes of March 10 carries Rob- 
ert Trumbull's news article about “cer- 
tain strictures” demanded by Canada 
of India and Pakistan in return for 
Canada's resumption of nuclear aid to 
those countries. 

I have no objections to Mr. Trum- 
bull’s article, of course, but can’t help 
reflecting how ridiculous it is for the 
countries involved to pretend that 
India’s and Pakistan's objectives are 
other than making atomic bombs, or 
that their agreement to "certain stric- 
tures" will mean anything if and when 
the time comes to invoke their rights 
of "sovereignty" and "self-defense." 

Perhaps nothing can be done to stop 
their programs to arm with atomic 
bombs, but 1 wish they would spare 
us the double-talk.

Alaska: What the Wolves Are Doing 


To the Editor: 

As an Alaskan, I would like to an- 
swer the recent letter of Gary Goss 
about "Saving Alaska's Wolves.” 

It is astounding to know that there 
are so many Alaskan wolf experts in 
the "lower 4S” who sit in their nice 
tidy world and give us all kinds of 
advice and/or criticism on how to 
handle our wolf problem here in the 
bush. 

Our biggest problem with the wolf 
situation are all the misguided, misin- 
formed busybodies butting in on some- 
thing that cannot, by any stretch of 
the imagination, be any of their busi- 
ness. 

We are not trying to decimate our 
wolves — only trying to control a preda- 
tor the way all our sister states con- 
trol their predators, by thinning out 
the problem areas. The main reason 
for thinning them is not moose, 
although there are many square miles 
with no calves, only adults. 

Wolves are invading the outskirts 
of Fairbanks, Chugiak and Eagle River 
and killing and eating chained dogs in 
back yards, plus goats, horses and 
other valuable animals we depend on. 


Six dogs were devoured just sixteen 
miles from downtown Anchorage. 

We don't care how they do things 
in the Algonquin Park — or even in New 
York. We couldn't care less about 
"placating the opinions in the other 
49 states." 

We have the same right to control 
our state’s destiny as the people in. 
New York have to control theirs. 

It's galling to us to be treated like a 
"poor relation” by you people on the 
"outside" who believe we live in snow 
igloos and eat blubber. We have a 
beautiful country up here and are tiy- 
ing very hard to preserve and control 
our vast wilderness, so we can live in 
harmony with it. We do not need to 
be hamstrung in our efforts by do- 
gooders who don't know what they’re 
talking about. Do we up here tell you 
how to handle your problems? 

Surely, there must be some small 
problem in New York that could con- 
cern Mr. Goss and others like him. 

If nothing else, find homes for the 
150 wolves that are to be killed. 
We'll gladly live-trap them and ship 
them to you. Mary Duffy

Wild Dreams of a New Beginning 


By Lawrence Ferlinghetti 


There’s a breathless hush on the freeway tonight 


The seas come in over Utah . 

. Beyond the ledges of concrete 


Mormon Tabernacles washed away like barnacles 

restaurants fall into dreams 


Coyotes are confounded & swim nowhere 

with candlelight couples 


Ah orchestra onstage in Omaha 

Lost Alexandria still burns 


keeps on playing Handel’s Water Music ■ 

in a billion lightbulbs ■ 


Homs fill with, water 

Lives cross lives 


and bass players float away on their instruments 

idling at stoplights 


clutching them like lovers horizontal 

Beyond the cloverleaf turn-offs 


Chicago’s Loop becomes a rollercoaster 

'Souls eat souls in the general emptiness ’ 


Skyscrapers filled like waterglasses 

A piano concerto comes out a kitchen window 


Great Lakes mixed with Buddhist brine 

A yogi speaks at Ojai . 


Great Books watered down in Evanston 

It's all taking place in one mind’ 


Milwaukee beer topped with sea-foam 

On the lawn among the trees 


Beau Fieuve of Buffalo suddenly become salt 

lovers are listening 


Manhattan Island swept clean in sixteen seconds 

far the master to tell them they are one 


buried masts of Amsterdam arise 

with the universe 


as - the great wave sweeps on Eastward 

Eyes smell flowers and become them 


to wash away over-age Camembert Europe 

There’s a deathless hush 


Mannahatta steaming in sea-vines 

on the freeway tonight 


the washed land awakes again to wilderness 

as a Pacific tidal wave a mile high 


the only sound a vast thrumming of crickets - 

sweeps in 


a cry of seabirds high .over 

Los Angeles breathes its last gas 


in empty eternity 

and sinks into the sea like the Titanic all lights lit

The Way the Government Is Going 


41 



Our Government seems to be going 
haywire. It has responded to the over- 
whelming evidence of misdeeds by the 
Central Intelligence Agency, Federal 
Bureau of Investigation and other in- 
telligence agencies by ratifying past 
abuses and sanctioning their continua- 
tion. And very few people seem to 
mind or even notice. 

1, Covert activities. The Government 
has participated in a number of war- 
like acts, termed “covert activities,” 
against, countries With which .the 
United states is at peace. These ac- 
tivities include the use of military-type 
force; bribery, and tampering with the 
interim politics and domestic tran- 
quility of other countries. 

. .Although our Constitution provides 
that Congress, not the President, must 
decide when we go to war, the Presi- 
dent. -Continues to assert a -right to. 
initiate such action without prior Con- 
gressional approval. . . . 

Instead of removing all doubt and' 
declaring such activities unlawful un- ' 
less expressly permitted, the Senate is 
on its way to adopting a resolution 
containing a watered-down compro- 
mise that hardly changes the status 
quo. 

2. Government lawlessness. The 
Government seems uninterested in 
enforcing the law against high office- 
holders. A compelling case has been 
made for the need for a temporary 
“special prosecutor” to investigate 
and prosecute crimes by intelligence 
officials, but the Ford Administration 
resists the notion. 

Instead of concentrating on such 


By Raymond S. Calamaio 


crimes, the House of Representatives 
has decided to investigate Daniel 
Schorr, a newsman, for providing The 
Village Voice with a “secret” report 
on Intelligence that bad already been 
leaked and described in a number of 
newspaper stories. 

3. Oversight This is. the process by 
which Congress makes -sure that the 
executive is enforcing the law con- 
sis teat. with the Constitution. A resolu- 
tion to improve oversight by forming 
a new Senate committee is being con- 
sidered.' The measure approved by 
the Government Operations Commit- 
tee is a very promising start, but over- 
sight has failed so badly in the past 
that much more must be done than 
merely to give a new committee over- 
sight responsibility. 

The heart of the problem has been 
that many legislators preferred not to 
know when it came to matters of in- 
telligence. For a new oversight com- 
mittee to be truly effective, it will 
be necessary to require it to be in- 
formed on certain specific 1 subjects. 
Those 'subjects should include Intel - 
, ligence activities that pose a particular 
threat to individual rights, for example 
surveillance and dissemination of in- 
formation in investigative files. 

It is not too late for the Senate to 
strengthen- the resolution in this way. 
or to write these requirements into a 


separate measure. But, unfortunately, 
some Senate staff members fear that 
the resolution will be weakened by 
the Rules Committee. For example, it 
is known that a number of pro-FB.L • 
senators will attempt to deprive the 
to-be-formed oversight committee of 
power over legislation concerning FJB.L 
intelligence , activities. Without such 
power, oversight would not just be 
ineffective, as in the past, but laugh- 
able. ‘ 

4. Secrecy. The executive and the 
Congress seem to be falling all over 
each other to invent methods to pre- 
vent disclosure of classified informa- 
tion. So much effort is being spent on 
this that it seems to have been for- 
gotten why we got into the subject 
in the first place. 

The real questions are how to pre- 
vent the recurrence of intelligence- 
agency abuse of people's constitu- 
tional rights, and how to prevent the 
President from engaging the United 
States in unauthorized military and 
paramilitary activities. 

The problem is not how further to 
protect these agencies from account- 
ability by tightening procedures for 
secrecy. 

President Ford has sent to the Con- 
gress a bill to toughen penalties 
against individuals who disclose in- 
telligence “sources and methods.” 
Presumably, it could have been used

Paying 
The Price 
Of Empire 


By C. L. Sulzberger 


LISBON— Portugal is paying a steep 
price for the unenviable boast of hav- 
ing been the world’s very last great 
overseas empire. This position, im- 
posed by a myopic dictatorship that 
was only overthrown two years ago, 
is at the root of every major problem 
here today. 

Public health, illiteracy, employ- 
ment, investment, infiltration, produc- 
tion remain at dreadful levels. And 
things are going badly between Lis- 
bon and its former colonies, although 
some Cabinet ministers connected with 
such affairs like to gild the skunk 
cabbage. As Mario Soares, head of 
the Socialist Party (this nation’s larg- 
est - ). realistically says: 

‘Totalitarian regimes have been in- 
stalled there [the ex-colonies] and 
they are close to the Sonet orbiL 
The West is paying for its stupidity 
in not helping movements for inde- 
pendence from the SaJazar (Portugal's 
dictator] regime." Josd Medeiros Fer- 
reira, Secretary of State for Foreign 
Affairs, adds: “We expect to play a 
difficult role vis-a-vis our former pos- 
sessions during the next few years.” 

There is no escaping the United 
States share in the blame. Our National 
Security Council decided six years ago 
to - support Portuguese administration 
in Angola and Mozambique in order 
to avoid “chaos and increased oppor- 
tunities for the Communists.” This 
policy produced precisely what it . 
sought to avoid. 

Nationalist movements in Portuguese 
Africa infected the forces sent to 
restrain them with their own ideology 
and methodology. These inspired a 
revolution in Lisbon plus both chaos 
and near-Communism. African regimes 


FOREIGN AFFAIRS 


to send Daniel Ellsberg to prison for 
releasing the Pentagon papers (much 
information in these papers is what 
the Pentagon would probably describe 
as “sources and methods"). 1 

In addition, the resolution at present 
being considered by the Senate Rules 
Committee includes a pernicious provi- 
sion to discipline senators for dis- 
closing secret information. As Senator 
Jacob K. Javits correctly argued,' but 
to no avail, this provision contravenes 
the spirit of the speech and debate 
clause in our Constitution. 

5. Infiltration. Typical of the whole 
approach to solving — or, more ac- 
curately, not solving — the 'problem is 
the part of President Ford's executive 
order that permits the CJA. to in- 
filtrate student,, labor and cultural 
organizations even though such ac- 
tivity was banned by a 1967 executive 
order. 

No wonder that the former Director 
of Central Intelligence William E. Colby 
can say that intelligence has emerged 
“from the shadowy field outside the 
law.” Intelligence has not been brought 
inside the law; instead the law is being 
stretched to include intelligence- 
agency crimes and bad acts. 

We should consider seriously 
whether our nation needs to spend 
even a small fraction of its present 
budget of SIP billion on intelligence. 
We should consider carefully the sug- 
gestions of serious individuals like 
L F. Stone, Henry Steele Commager 
and Garry Wills, who have recom- 
mended dismantling the C.LA. . 

Many of the same -people who npw 
tell us our national security depends 
on intense intelligence activities are 
those who told us our national security 
depended bn fighting a war in Vietnam. 


were created that are anti-Western 
(above all anti-U.S.A.) and even irked 
with sympathizers here. 

Adm. Victor Crespo, Minister of 
Cooperation (a job once called Colonial 
Minister), assured me less than one 
hundred Portuguese are. now jailed in 
Mozambique. The figure is probably 
six times as large. And residents of 
that former colony — including those 
in “re-indoctrination camps” or prison 
—who don’t show up at homes or 
offices within ninety, days, are auto- 
matically dispossessed. 

The bitter feelings brought to 
Lisbon by an airlifted 400,000 Angolan 
refugees have been further soured by 
events in Mozambique. This stirs an 
anger that has considerable political 
importance here. Thirty percent of the 
new voters enrolled for next month’s 
legislative elections are homeless 
emigrants from Africa who are also 
mostly jobless. 

Maybe in time these people will 
prove to be of long-term benefit to 
Portugal because they represent much 
talent, energy and enterprise. But right 
now. despite an impressive national 
effort to care for them, house them 
and resettle them, they are unhappy, 
resentful and potentially dangerous. 

Many Portuguese are far from con- 
vinced that it was wise for Lisbon to 
ignore ks own pledge (the Alvor agree- 
ment) to the three competing Angolan 
nationalist movements by recognizing 
the Popular Movement (bLPiA.) 
Government. People here with Angolan 
experience say MJ.L.A. isn’t capable 
of imposing itself on the entire country, 
even with Soviet and Cuban support. 

With an election In the offing, the 
decision to recognize was avoided for 
a while because of differing internal 
reasons: (1) to court the anti-M-P.L-A. 
refugee vote; (2) to reaffirm last year’s 
Alvor accord; (3) to avoid irritating the 
West. But these were all forgotten 
when Western capitals, led by Paris, * 
rushed to acknowledge MPXA.’s 
regime while certain Liston Provisional 
Government leaders (now far left of a 
changing public opinion) urged recog- 
nition. 

Many disagree with Admiral Crespo’s 
belief that M.P.L.A. is the “only 
party” capable of governing Angola. 
Yet a kind of political coup de main 
was engineered here to support that 
view. Adm. Rosa Coutjnho, a former 
member of the National Revolutionary 
Council in Lisbon (once the PortUT 
guese revolution’s high commissioner 
in Angola), has just returned there for 
reasons nobody can explain. 

Admiral Coutinho no longer holds an 
official position. He is accused by 
some observers of having helped engi- 
neer a Lisbon-Moscow-Havana coup 
favoring MPJ.A while still on the rev- 
olutionary council. Crespo says there 
is no confirmable evidence of tins.- - 

The obvious ultimate solution for 
Portugal is to join the European Eco- 
nomic Community to which all dis- 
possessed former overseas imperial 
powers belong: Britain, France, Italy, 
Belgium, the Netherlands. They have 
discovered they can effectively pool 
their energies in that common enter- 
prise and at the same time can en- 
courage continued links between in- 
dustrial Europe and developing Africa. 

However, Portuguese Africa, with 
its long-delayed freedom and currently 
pro-Marxist bias, is far from playing 
any role in such a Eurafrican com- 
bination. And so is Portugal itself — 
with its antiquated economy and still- 
provisional Government unable to un- 
dertake long-range obligations.

Says Legislative Leaders 
Eliminated $2.3 Mifiion 
for Medicaid Audits 



•f 71|#- 

* -s-- J ■ 










Charles J. Hynes, the special 
prosecutor for nursing homes, 
said yesterday that legislative 
leaders had eliminated what 
he called a vital $2.3 million] 
fund for Medicaid enforcement! 
that had been promised by 
Governor Carey in his State 
of the State message in Jan- 
uary. 

Mr. Hynes, who termed the 
action an •'outrage." said he 
had been informed that the 
decision had been made at a 
meeting attended by Speaker 
Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn 
and the Assembly majority 
leader. Albert H. Bluraenthal, 
of Manhattan, on the Democrat- 
ic side, and the Senate majori- 
ty leader, Warren M. Anderson 
of Binghamton, Senator John 
J. March i of Staten Island, and 
the Assembly minority leader. 
Perry B. Duryea of Montauk, 
L. L, on the Republican side. 

All but Mr. Duiyea have fig- 
ured prominently in investiga- 
tions of political influence in 
behalf of nursing-home opera- 
tors, and Mr. Blumenthal faces 
indictments for bribery' ^ 
perjury, brought by Mr. Hynes. 

Special Line Included 
- The money in question is 
not Mr. Hynes's regular budget 
but a special line in the Health 
Department budget, for the hir- 
.ing of 90 additional auditor? 
and some 40 lawyers and other 
staff members. The people 
would be trained 'and directed 
by the Hynes office, to conduct 
a full audit of all the state's 
proprietary nursing homes over 
The next 12 months. 

"If somebody is saying that 
this was stopped because some 
people in the legislature are 
being investigated, chat is not 
the way it developed,” said 
Senator Manfred Ohrenstein of 
Manhattan, the Domestic mi- 
nority leader, at a news con- 
ference. 

His Republican counterpart. 
Senator Anderson, said that the 
Legislature fully intended to 
give the Health Department 
enough auditors <to deal with 
nursing home corruption and 
that J20 new auditors would be 
called for in the budget placed 
at the disposal of Mr. Hynes. 

Senator Anderson's top fiscal 
aide. James L. Biggane, said 
that he had first suggested the 
deletion of the Hynes auditors 
because Chose auditors were al- 
ways intended to be placed in 
the Health Department and 
"Mr. Hynes should avail him- 
self of those resources. 

In his first annual report 
last January, Mr. Hynes said 
that on. the basis of his past 
audits of 70 nursing homes, 
in all of which he said be 
had found fraud, he estimated 
that the full audit would recov- 
er at least S70 million for Medi- 
oaid. 

Mr. Hynes said last night 
tharl this estimate now ap- . 
peared to be conservative. . 

“I am angry," he said. "The . 
outrage is that this $2.3 million 
would be 75 percent returnable 
by the Federal Government. If 
you lake away the possibility 
of venality, then it's just short- 
sighted." . 

Later, Mr. Hynes sard that 
Governor Carey had renewed 
his commitment to the special 
enforcement fund last night, 
and promised to submit it in 
bis supplementary budget. 

Mr. Hynes had expressed the 
hope that when his office went 
out of existence, about the end 
of next year, he would be able 
to turn' over to the Health 
Department a Medicaid rate 
base that would have been 
purged of fraud, and a force i 
of trained auditors and lawyers 
to keep it that way. 

He recalled that Governor 
Carey had promised him the 
money, adding: "He's been yen 1 
cooperative." But he declined 
to comment on the propriety 
of legislative leaders who were |

The deletion of the special 
fund appeared in a brief pas- 
sage of the budget submitted 
by the leaders yesterday. After 
reporting that the budget pro- 
vided for 16S new positions 
for "health facility survey 
teams” and 220 more auditors, 
at an added cost of S5.8 million 
it said: 

“No funds are approved for 
permanent audit and fraud unit 
(52,236,000). Sufficient auditing 
personnel are provided as noted 
above to fulfill this function." 

. John L. Hardy, secretary' of 
the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee, said in Albany that 
he and his Republican counter- 1 
part. James L. Biggane. secre- 
tary of the Senate Finance 
Committee, considered the 
Hvnes request “entirely unjus- - 
tified.** 

“How many auditors do wo 
need when we’re up against 
the wall fiscally?" he said. 
"This has nothing to do with 
Hynes. Blumenthal or Stein- 
gut.” 

Asked about the statement 
of Assemblyman Blumenthal in 
a speech on Monday, express- 
ing a desire for a quick trial 
and a hope that Mr. Hynes 
would cooperate to that end. 
the prosecutor replied: 

“As l*ve said a numher of 
times, the prosecutor is always 
readv for trial the day after 
an indictment, I am ready to 
go tn trial as rapidly as he 
wants. I'll be glad to' cooper- 
ate.”

X TRit 


In the airline business on- time performance Is the 
name of the game. And for 13 months running (through 
January 76 when the latest CAB statistics were published) 
TWA has a better on-time performance record than either 
United or American. 

And we’d like you to know exactly how we came out 
on top. ^ou see, the facts of the matter are that the Civil 
Aeronautics Board monitors die on-time departure and 
arrival of every regularly scheduled flight tor 100 U.S. 
city pairs (excluding those under 200 miles). Any flight 
arriving within 15 minutes of its scheduled arrival is*" 
considered to be on time. 


The CAB then records this information on their form 
438. And based on these figures tor 13 months through 
January of this year, TVVA had more of its planes arriving on 
time (or within the 15-minute limit) than eidier United or 
American. 

It’s a record our people worked hard for and we can 
understand why our competition is upset about it. 

These figures represent 55% of TWA s available seat 
miles actually flown, or about 2,000 flights each week. 

So the next time you have an important appointment 
somewhere, you know which airline to take. 

TWA. The on-time airline. 














TWA flies to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Las Vegas, Denver 
m and many other major cities across the U.S.

Save-VeniceDrive

Sped*! to The Sew Yoa Timn 

VENICE — Three years after terioration of the city was a 


Tin flaw York TUns/uite Keu 

The lobby of Peachtree Center Plaza is seven stories high and contains a half-acre 
lake. The boteL, designed by John Portman, has 1,070 rooms. 


Italy passed a special law to 
protect Venice, work lags far 
behind schedule, but the first 
signs of progress are appear- 
ing. 

Political and bureaucratic 
problems continue to plague 
the project, which UNESCO de- 
scribes as “the biggest opera- 
tion ever undertaken anywhere 
in the world to preserve, re- 
store and revitalize a historic 
town.” Only a small fraction 
of the 5475 million appropriat- 
ed by the law has been spent. 

But now that most of the 
city's heating units have been 
converted to gas, the air is 
cleaner. Aqueducts have re- 
placed many underground 
wells, and the land has ap- 
parently stopped sinking. 
Plans are finally being drafted 
for new systems to process 
sewage and control high tides, 
which periodically swamp the 
city. 

The law will cover only 5 
percent of Venice's needs, ac- 
cording to Eduardo Salzano, 
the city’s chief planner. "But 
the important thing is to start 
the mechanism working.” he 
said. “So far it's been stag- 
nant." 

100,000 on Island 

To outsiders, Venice can be 
a cross between the louvre 
and Disneyland, an incompar- 
able mixture of plazas and 
palaces, museums and marble, 
canals and cannelloni, churches 
and charm. But the island of 
Venice, the historic center of 
a city that once influenced 
the entire Mediterranean world, 
also houses 100,000 people and 
the work that keeps them 
alive. 

The greatest problem facing 
planners here is to reconcile 
values that often seem to be 
in conflict. How do they pre- 
serve the artistic and archi- 
tectural masterpieces produced 
by the Venetians of 500 years 
ago and still promote the so- 
cial and economic well-being 
of the current residents? ' 

Flood Damage in 1966 

That problem has come into 
focus more sharply since last 
June, when Venice elected a 
Socialist mayor and a Com- 
munist deputy mayor. The new 
administration has strongly en- 
dorsed historic preservation, 
but it places top priority on 
stopping the rapid emigration 
from the island. 

The population has dropped 
by more than 40 percent in 
the last 20 years, and analysts 
say that the two main causes 
are shortages of jobs and of 
adequate housing. 

The current campaign to 
“save Venice” began in 1966, 
when the city was swept by 
a devastating flood. The United 
Nations Economic, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization is- 
sued a worldwide appeal for 
funds to selvage the paintings, 
sculptures and buildings that 
had been damaged. 

More than 20 private nation- 
al groups responded by con- 
tributing about S3.5 million, and 
their work is continuing. But 
as they got involved, the groups 
realized that the physical de-

very- complex process. 

Twice a day tides from the 
Adriatic sweep into the lagoon 
surrounding Venice and batter 
building foundations. Saltwater 
from ihe canals creeps up 
through the scone and brick 
through capillary action. Water 
vapor in the air condenses on 
the surface. As the liquid evap- 
orates. the salt crystallizes and 
expands, cracking the stone. 

Then the salt attracts more 
water, starting the cycle all 
over again. 

This has been happening for 
centuries, of course, but now 
the buildings are old and frag- 
ile, and modern innovations 
have made matters worse. Cen- 
tral heating accelerates the cap- 
illary action. Cement, which is 
now used as mortar instead of 
lime, attracts water. 

Huge petrochemical plants 
have developed nearby and 
motor boats have replaced gon- 
dolas. The resulting air pollu- 
tion covers many buildings 
with black crust that eats away 
at the stone. 

Instead of just restoring in- 
dividual buildings, some groups 
have sought more long-range 
projects. The West Germans, 
for instance, have refurbished 
an old palace on the Grand 
Canal and have established a 
permanent research institute. 

But these efforts were piece- -;1 
meal. The conviction grew here 
that the problems of Venice 't 
had to be tackled in a com- 
prehensive way. and in March Avgj 
1973 the Government adopted 
the special law. 

Delay Is Typical 

The directives to put the !aw>^3 
into effect were supposed to ba*^8 
issued that fall, but they were 'Ji| 
not published until last March« 
Such delays have been typical. '3g33 
but the outlook is not entirely 
gloomy. 

Fifty public buildings have 
now r been designated for re- 
storation, and work is sched- 
uled to begin this summer on 
the first one, a high schooL The 
foundations are so eroded that 
the building is supported main- ; 
ly by the neighboring struc- j 
tures. The wooden beams in j 
the classrooms are so cracked / 
that the ceilings are held up j 
by metal jacks. / 

The first target for residential / 
rehabilitation is Campo de/ 
Ruga, a worldng-class distric 
near the old shipyards. Then 
several hundred people live ii 
17th-century buildings groupet 
around a small square. 

Water from the canals seep^ 

10 feet up the walls, making 
the ground floors terribly hui 
mid. Most apartments lack 
bathrooms or central heating. 

The restoration plan seeks to 
provide modern comforts, while 
retaining the shape and scale 
of traditional community life. 

But planners still have not 
decided where the residents will 
go while their homes are being 
renovated, or how they will 
pay for the higher rents when 
they return. Detailed plans 
have not yet been approved by 
regional authorities, and work 
will not start for two years. 

Similar problems occur 
throughout the project. Preser- 
vationists would like to narrow 
or close off the openings to the 
Venice lagoon, which surrounds 
the island, in order to control 
the tides. But industrialists and 
politicians worry that such a 
project would hurt the port and 
cost jobs. For the same reason 
city officials have been reluc- 
tant to enforce stringent anti- 
pollution reguations. 

The original town plan di- 
vided the city into two zones, 
one where renovation would be 
strictly controlled and the other 
where new building would be 
permitted. This was roundly 
attacked by preservationists, 
and the new administration 
seems to share their view. But 
many Venetians argue that rigid 
standards could choke the city’s 
economy. 

The plan also provided for an 
expansion of the industrial dis- 
trict on the mainland west of 
the island. This was also widely 
criticized here, and a compro- 
mise has been devised designat- 
ing the area for new port facili- 
ties instead of industiy. 

Experts here believe that the 
city needs a comprehensive plan 
to sort out and evaluate these 
conflicting values. A team from 
UNESCO is starting a study 
that would provide guidelines 
for such a plan.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1976 


Arol T urns Down Building BOYS TOWN LI 
City Put Up for It in Bronx ’T5 INCOME DROP 


William T. Taylor, Ex-Chaima^l^umn 

Of ACF Industries, Dead at 75 


By JOHN L. HESS 


The Arol Development Cor- 
poration, operator of the Bronx 
Terminal Market, has refused 
to accept a $4.1 million budd- 
ing that the oity put up for 
it there, asserting that the con- 
crete is cracking and the roof 
leaks. 

The new 130.000-square-foot 
building was presented to Arol 
on Jan. 1 under the terras of 
a lease that, according to the 
city’s Investigation Department 
and the State Select Committee 
on Crime, may have been 
awarded fraudulently. 

The market was leased to 
Arol for 99 years, beginning 
in May 1972, ostensibly as part 
of a development plan. In No- 
vember 1973 an amendment 
to the lease transferred obliga- 
tions for repair and construc- 
tion from Arol to the city, 
at a cost of more than $10 
million to the city. A lawyer 
for Arol in the transaction was 
Patrick J. Cunningham, chair- 
man of the Democratic state 
committee. 

Tenants Balk at Rent 

Arol was to pay $30,000 a 
year In rent for the new build- 
ing — or 61.5 cents a square 
foot — in the early years of the 
lease. It was offered by Arol 
at $3 a square foot to merch- 
ants in the market, who are 
being evicted to make room 
for Yankee Stadium parking. 
They have balked at the rent, 
and the building remains 
empty. 

But a dispute about the con- 
dition of the building makes 
it possible that the city, and 
not Arol, will have to pay 
for its upkeep and debt service 
until tenants are found who 
are willing to pay Aral's price. 
Arol advertised for other ten- 
ants last Sunday. 

It ha'd been reported that 
the building was officially com- 
pleted by the Department of 


turned over to Arol on 
schedule. Henry Gavan, counsel 
to the Economic Development 
Administration, acknowledged 
in an interview that Arol had 
from the begmning challenged 
the building's "structural integ- 
rity" and had called it "unten- 
antable.” 

A review of agency files 
showed that as early as last 
Dec. 19 Mr. Gavan had warned 
Alfred Etsenpreis, who heads 
the E.D.A., that cracks in the 
concrete floors were such that 
Arol might reject the building. 

Mr. Gaven said that there 
had been concern all along 
about a possibly marshy condi- 
tion and that Arol had raised 
this problem in J974 in discus- 
sions about the possibility of 
its doing the building itself, 
for the city. 

’Showdown' Expected 
In support of Arol’s claim, 
it appearedi that there was 
some construction work going 
on last month in the supposedly 
completed building. Mr. Gaven 
said that Arol had indicated 
that it would ultimately take 
over the building, but that! 
there might be a dispute about 
when the rent was due. He 
said he expected a showdown 
at a meeting with engineers 
for both sides late this week. 

A spokesman for the Depart- 
ment of Public Works said last 
night that the building con- 
formed to the specifications 
of the agreement with Arol 
and that the cracks were nor- 
mal effects of shrinkage in a 
new building, were being 
caulked and would have caused 
only minor inconvenience to 
tenants. 

He added Arol had objected 
to a lack of firing for a meat- 
processing plant, but that the 
lease called for a conventional 
market warehouse. 

A lawyer for Arol declined 


Receipts Fell in Year to 
$20.9 Million

BOYS TOWN, Neb.. March 
16 (AP) — Boys Town, a private 
Roman Catholic institution, re- 
ported today that it had an 
income of $20.9 million in 1975, 
down from $22. 1 million in 
1974, and total assets of more 
than $242 million at the end 
of the year. 

Although donations, bequests 
and investment income de- 
clined during 1975, Boys Town 
said its total assets increased 
by $4 million from 1974, in 
part because of new construc- 
tion and the increased value 
of its buildings. 

The $242 million in total 
assets was up sharply from 
the $191.4 million net worth 
disclosed in an article that won 
a Pulitzer Prize in 1972. 

The Sun Newspapers of Oma- 
ha. a suburban weekly newspa- 
per group, won the prize when 
it disclosed for the first time 
the wealth of the private insti- 
tution founded in 1917 by the 
Rev. Edward Flanagan on the 
western edge of Omaha. 

Boys Town cares for orphans 
and bovs referred by courts 
or social agencies. T£ere are 
398 boys there now. The place 
achieved considerable public 
recognition after a 1838 jam 
“Boys Town, starring Mickey 
Rooney and Spencer Tracy. 

Its income from mail appeals 
and bequests was down from 
$10.9 million in 1974 to $9.9 
million in 1975. Income from 
dividens interest and gam 
on investments declined by 
$233,196 during the year, ac 


William Towson Taylor, chair- 
man of ACF industries Inc. 
from 1957 to 1967 and a lead- 
ing New York banker for more 
than 30 years, died Mondy at 
his home at 15 Pecksland Road, 
Greenwich, Conn. He was 75 
years old. 

Mr. Taylor led diversification 
of the concern, formerly the 
American Car and Foundry 
Company. 

The corporation, a manufac- 
turer and leaser of railroad 
freight and tank cars, now also 
makes a wide range of products 
for the automotive, oil, elec- 
tronic and other industries. 

Asked about the company’s 
policies, Mr. Taylor, a robust, 
vivacious man, made the fol- 
lowing remarks in a 1953 
interview: 

"We have lots of capital, are 
interested in' diversity, but 
don’t intend getting into the 
corset business. We won’t go 
into something we don't know 
and understand.” 

Was a Lawyer 

Mr. Taylor, a lawyer, had 
been vice president of the Guar- 
anty Trust Company and the 
Bankers Trust Company. One 
of his specialities was lending 
money to movie companies. 

He had also been a director 
of the Allied Stores Corpora- 
tion, Pitney -Bowes Inc., the 
General Time Corporation, the 
Adams Express Company, the 
CoHins & Aikman Corporation 
and the Union Trust Company 
in Connecticut 

Mr. Taylor was born in Balti- 
more and received BA. and 
LL.B. degrees from Columbia 
University in 1921 and 1923. 
He worked his way through 
college and law school as an

the State Division for Youth, 
Peter B. Edelman, told a Senate

youthful offenders were need- 
ed. not the larger ones some 
legislators have called for. 

At the same time, Mr. Edel- 
man, who has been acting head 
of the division for six months, 
deflected expected criticism 
from those who feel he is too 
soft in his approach to handling 
voung offenders by telling the 
Senate Committee on Crime 
and Correction that he was 
equally concerned with protect- 
ing society from the depreda- 
tions of truly hardened youth- 
ful wrongdoers.

lin, died Sunday at the Uni- 
versity of California Medical 
Center. He was 73 years old. 

Judge Carr was United States 
Attorney for the Southern Dis- 
trict of California from 1943 to 
1946. In 1944 he prosecuted Mr.

ported Joan Berry to and from 
New York for unmoral pur- 
poses in 1942. The jury in Los 
Angeles acquitted Mr. Chaplin. 

Later Mr. Carr obtained dis- 
missal of Other criminal charges

Farm Estate Tax Aid Asked 
NEW ORLEANS. March 26 
(UPI)— The National Farmers 
Union urged Federal action 
today on estate taxes, farm 
imports and crop insurance to 
bolster the agricultural econ- 
omy. The group, in the second 
day of its national convention, 
endorsed a proposal to raise 
the Federal estate tax exemp- 
tion from $60,000 now to 
$270,000 so family farms would 
not be forced out of operation 
by high taxes. President Ford 
has proposed an increase *~ 
$150,000.

March Held to Back 
Pressmen in Capital 

WASHINGTON. March 16 
(AP) — About 160 persons 
staged a candlelight march 
tonight to the home, of The 
Washington Post’s publisher, 
Katharine Graham, in sup- 
port of union pressmen who 
have been on strike against 
the newspaper for more than 
five months. 

The demonstration also 
was intended to draw atten- 
tion to the suicide of one of 
the strikers. Union members 
and supporters contend that 
a pressman, John Clauss. 59 
years old, shot himself to 
death last month in despair 
over being out of work since 
the walkout began last Oct. 1. 
After the pressmen re- 


debt- While the temporary debt 
limit was raised through June 
30. no change was made in the 
permanent ceiling of $400 bil- 
lion.

acting on the budgeL They 
were repulsed at the glass 
doors by state and city police- 
men while representatives en- 
tered the parlor adjacent to 
the chamber to talk with some 
Senators about their grievances. 

At about 5 P.M. the students 
left the building to return to 
the buses that had brought 
them to the capital. They as- 
serted that they had shown the 
Legislature that they were or- 
ganized to react to the budget 
cuts. 

Even while the demonstra- 
tions organized by the student 
government groups and other 
campus groups were going on, 
there was a compromise afoot 
affecting at least one of the 
students’ concerns. Legislative 
leaders agreed tothe Governors

Mocha Cheesecake to Satisfy a New Yorker’s Soul 


By CRAIG CLAIBORNE 

■Although it cannot be claimed that cheese- 
cake is the most frequently eaten dessert in 
Manhattan (as far as we know that is vanilla 
ice cream), it is almost certainly one of the 
most typical of Gotham’s creations and the 
one dessert that seems to fill displaced New 
Yorkers with the most nostalgic feelings. 

Cheesecake, as it is made and consumed 


in Manhattan, is pure New Yorkese although 
its origins are difficult to trace. Cheesecakes 
of one sort or another do exist in many coun- 
tries in Europe, the Polish curd cake, the 
cassata alia Sicilians, the Viennese Topfen- 
kuchen and so on — but somehow the relation- 
ships seem tenuous at best. They miss in 
spirit the flavor and texture of what might 
be ‘called New York’s soul food. 


' "There are hundreds, of recipes for cheese- 
cake, and one of the best and most unusual 
we’ve sampled recently .is a mocha cheese- 
cake' flavored with coffee and chocolate. The 
method of making this cheesecake is reduced 
-to its simplest terms in the step photographs 
shown here. Please read all the instructions 
thoroughly and have all the ingredients ready 
before starting .to cook.

Only in America 

America, you're beautiful! And as your bicentennial rolls 
around, we just couldn't be any prouder -L or happier than 
to have been a part of your history for the past 71 years 


Where else could a young immigrant start out 
with a small butter & egg dairy and have it 
blossom into a chain of modern 
supermarkets? Only in America! 

So, we say a prayer of thanks 
for 200 years of freedom and 
opportunity. And with it goes 


the hope that we'il celebrate 
many more years together.

president of the 
£ J^the Association of 
. /- . •:> ,*iDance Companies. 
-^Vith the Countess 



Marina de B rentes, Mrs. 
Traub was co-chairman of 
the S50-a-head benefit and 
had arranged for nine danc- 
ers from a company called 
America's Second Century to 
model the dresses. 

An hour before the party 
was to start. Rdgine sat in 
an improvised dressing room 
while her personal makeup 
man. Jacques Clemente of 
Elizabeth Arden in Paris, ap- 
plied her mascara and Jean 
Louis Hym of the Cinandre 
salon fluffed up her red 
curls. Outside, pandemoni- 
um reigned. Electricians 
cursed, dancers .practiced 
leaps, the florist's men car- 
rying great sheaves of calla 


lilies jostled those with cases 
of liquor. 

Bloomingdale's clerks blew 
up balloons and tossed them 
on the dance floor, where 
an early arrival. Hurley 
Papock, did an improvised 
wriggle in a R£gine dress she 
had bought that day. En- 
gine's, husband, Roger Chou- 
kron, and a small army of 
managers and waiters gave 
orders in rapid French. 

It seemed that nothing 
could be ready in time. But, 
miraculously, as the crowds 
began to pour in. the hostess, 
dressed in a loose tunic and 
trousers of thin grey silk 
painted in gold, was there to 
kiss cheeks or brush hands 


with the wives of French dip- 
lomats, or Diana Vree- 
land and Diane von Fursten- 
berg and Candice Bergen and 
Ben Vereen and Hubert de 
Givenchy and Pauline Tri- 
g£re and Julio Tanjeloff, the 
Argentinian who has bought 
both Georg Jensen and the 
S. Klein on Union Square. 

Rfigine took to the micro- 
phone and apologized that 
there were not enough seats. 
“You are not got sitting." she 
said. “But I think you are 
enjoy." 

And they did. ''Super," 
"The best show I've ever 
seen.'* “It should make the 
•‘A Real Pro* 

designers here jealous." 
“What a wonderful way to 
show clothes," they cheered. 
"She's a real pro." 

Which, of course, R£gine 
is. Not only in the nightclub 
business, but she has also 
had experience selling 
clothes. “Before nightclubs," 
she explained, "I worked in 
France for boutiques as, bow 
you say, traveling salesman." 

She has always required 
that the women who come 
to her clubs be well dressed, 
she herself going to Saint 
Laurent and Dior for her 
evening clothes in the past. 
She has always wanted to de- 
sign clothes for dancing. “I 
am night woman,” she con- 
tinued. “I design to go with 
my personality. Everything 
is loose, supple, to move in 
freely.” 

Why is the collection 
called Zoa? "La Grande Zoa," 
she explained. ‘That is name 
of my lucky song I sing in 
Paris." It is about a char- 
acter who is an antiquarian 
by day and a transvestite 
who likes to dress up by 
night" 

The Time Is Right’ 

Her eyes (“Green when I 
am angry, brown when hap- 
py") look amused under her 
thin eyebrows. 

Rhine's eyes were brown 
as she watched her guests 
dancing on the glass floor. 
"The time is right for the 
dub and the clothes,” she 
said. "Women want to go 
out, to look feminine again." 

. The dancers seem to agree. 
“Divine" and “smashing” • 
were some of the words 
shrilled over the din erf the 
music.

Soup Stops: 
Informal, 



By MB® SHERATON 

Anyone regularly wanders around 
the city on foot, whether for 
or pleasure, sooner or tater devetops a 
collection of favorite resting places, usual- 
ly where some sort of food and dnnk 
is available, to renew energies, ootn 
phvsical and spirituaL For some these 
restorative stopovers may be oars, wnue 
others favor ice-cream parlors or pastry 
and coffee shops. But for many, including 
me, there are no stops like soup stops. 

In addition to offering great hearty 
soups served scaldingly hot, a bona fide 
soap stop must be informal and easygoing, 
requiring a minimum of Involvement and 
expenditure, which usually means a lunch- 
eonette with counter service. 

That set of requirements unfortunately 
eliminates the fairly new and fashionable 
soup restaurants such as La Potagerie, 
Pot au Feu and La. Bonne Soupe, ail 
self-conscious, complicated and expensive, 
although the last of the three has some 
interesting, well-prepared soups. 

The new soups at Chock Full oT'Iuts 
seemed promising, but four of the daily 
specials proved so disappointing that it 
seemed hopeless to continue. Clams in 
the pallid chowder were dry and papery, 
and the yellow hot water called chicken 
soup was adrift with dicings of chicken 
as spODSily soft as bean curd. Tomato 
rice and beef barley were starchy, salty 
and greasy— no bargains at any price. 

Small Places Better 

It is far better, then, to look for small 
independents and, luckily for the soup 
freak, there are many distributed around 
town. One of the most unprepossessing 
and rewarding is a tiny wedge of a lunch- 
eonette called; officially. Lorenzo’s Restau- 
rant, although the only name visible out- 
side is Italian Home Cooking. And while 
the formal address of this obscure find 
is 323 Bleecker . Street, it is really on 
Father Demo Square, at the point where 
Avenue of the Americas meets Carmine 
and Bleecker Streets. 

Having found this remote mecca, sit 
at the counter, or at one of the few 
tiny tables and try the unusual green, 
minestrone with its rich and velvety split 
pea base enriched by firm, fresh zucchini, 
celery, onions, peas,' string beans, cabbage 
or collard greens, dicing of potato and 
the short stubby macaroni, ditali. Heaped 
with grated romano cheese, and accompa- 
nied by a crusty cut of Italian whole-wheat 
bread, this makes a soul satisfying lunch 
for only $1.50 that is available only Mon- 
day through Friday, as this place closes 
weekends. 

Few soup stops can match the Front 
Porch, whether at its original Village loca- 
tion. 253 West 11th Street (comer of 
Fourth Street), or uptown at 2272 Broad- 
way (between Slst and 82d Streets). The 
window is a vertible greenhouse of hanging 
plants and. with the sparkling white- 
topped tables, young ana friendly help 
and the ingenious menu of fragrant, savory 
soups, this is among the city's more encou- 
raging outposts. 

Many Weekly Favorites 

Some of the many weekly favorites 
are Ukrainian borscht with cabbage, to- 
matoes and big lean chunks or beef, 
a Provensaie pistou that is virtually a 
vegetable stew, friar’s chicken soup creamy 
with, rice and barley and generously 
flecked with chicken and veal, and the 
Finnish summer vegetable soup, kesac. 
All can be had in bowls for SI .75. cups 
for $1.25. Either way. they are served 
with dark moist pumpernickel or yeasty 
Italian loaves. 

If ever in need of a soup fix in the 
East Village, lose no time in finding the 
B & H at 127 Second Avenue (near St. 
Mark’s Place). This slim, crowded, hectic 
and topsy-turvy luncheonette is a kosher 
dairy restaurant in disguise, with a long 
counter and a few uncomfortable tables. 
With luck, you’ll hit it when the thick, 
oniony lima bean soup is on hand, or, 
perhaps, the piquant cabbage or dill-scent- 
ed potato soups. The cold beet borscht 
or the sorrel-based schav, both enlivened 
with snowy peaks of sour cream, are 
the best I’ve ever tasted this side of 
my mother's kitchen. 

In a somewhat more sophisticated vein, 
try the thyme-scented Manhattan clam 
chowwr at the Grand Central Terminal 
Qystet Aar. Served with two fluffy biscuits 
and ah the oystereties you can eat, for 
95 cents, this makes an outstanding lunch 
or between-meal pickup. For more ambiti- 
ous appetites, indulge in the classic oyster 
stew. ($3.95) the plump and briny mollusks 
afloat in the creamy broth, or" the more 
fiery. Tabasco-spiked oyster pan roast 
($4.45), which is a personal favorite. 

More lavish soup entrees here vary 
from day to day, with the so ur-edged 
Russian solianka that includes sturgeon

THE NEW YORK TIMES. WEDNESDAY. MARCH 17, 1975 


With Those Rings, Stern Stdys Wed to New York 

Om PHTTVS MTRtV ■ ■ • 


By ENID NEMY 
Hans Stem got a great big 
band yesterday, and a lot of 
the people standing on the 
brand new red carpet and 
applauding until their palms 
hurt were city officials. No 
wonder. 

Mr. Stem, a Jewelry tycoon 
whose name is a byword in 
South America, Europe and 
the Middle East, was, at a 
time when some have in- 
dicated a loss of faith in Man- 
hattan, opening a plush and 


spacious street-level midtown 
store. 

•■New York is still the most 
important city in the world," 
said Mr. Stem, explaining 
why he had decided to ex- 
pand his smaller “upstairs" 
retail operation into a full- 
fledged prestigious, and ex- 
pensive, one in the Olympic 

Tower building. 

"Whatever happens, it 
won’t stop being the most 
important city in the world," 
he said. 

To mark his faith in the 


city, Mr. Stem not only pre- 
sented a $5,000 check to 
WNYC, the municipal bread- 
casting system, but also 
donated a supply of his low- 
er-priced jewels as prizes in 
a S5-a-chance penny arcade 
pinball machine. The 35 fee 
also went to WNYC. 

The machine, and another 
that supplied coffee beans to 
the winners, attracted a 
variety of guests, including 
Elinor Guggenheimer, the 
City’s Commissioner of Con- 


sumer Affairs; Robert L. 
Turner, genera! manager of 
Avery Fisher and Alice Tully 
Hails at Lincoln Center, and 
Sandy Bain of Restaurant As- 
sociates. 

Despite the champagne at 
• 1 1 A. M.. and the Donald 
Eruco White breakfast of 
brioche suert (brioche bread 
sliced and toasted with su- 
gar and almonds') and pro- 
sciutto-draped melon. .Mr. 
Stern insisted that his new- 
est store would cater to the 


«rr?-e trade “only as a by- 
product." 

“We Will cater to the mid- 
dle class and upper middle 
class." he said. 

The store will special- 
ise in colored stones— emer- 
alds, aquamarines, tourma- 
lines. topaz end amethyst. 
There are amethyst rings' at 
S57.50. emerald rings for 
SoO.GMO and diamond rings 
for SI 25,000. Bracelets, pins, 
earrings and necklaces are 
available in an equally wide 
range of prices. 


mrngmm 


Amethysts and 
diamonds 
valued at about 
$25,000 were 
worn by Jane 
Kipness at H. 
Stem opening.

$$$ Spent For Lunch 
Getting You Down? 

When figuring out the weekly food bud- 
get, do you remember to include the cost 
of lunches eaten away from home? These 
often-ignored costs add many dollars to 

weekly expenses. i 

The most economical A 
lunches, of course, are A 5» - \ 

toted from home. Press- \f\ \ 

ed for "packing” time 
in the morning? Try l 

preparing lunch the (ObFi. 
night before with dinner & 

leftovers and chilling it \ // 

immediately in the re- 
frigerator. Or, if sandwiches are your 
mainstay, they may be frozen and stored 
up to a month if properly wrapped. 
Diversity lends excitement to noon time. 
Use vour imagination in creating different 
lunches with foods for eating out-of-hand 
such as fresh, crisp vegetables, lean meat 
roll-ups, and a wide variety of cheeses. 

. If you want to warm 
V : Qrd up your day with a hot 
lunch it is easy to bring 
an iusufeted container 
or vacuum bottle with 
soup or a casserole. Be 
■ FiiiSf ifiSaP* sure your container 
keeps food at 140°F or 
iaa above— to prevent bac- 

teria growth . 

And though “brown bagging” can be a 
real money-saver, you don’t want to be a 
victim of food poisoning. Keep cold lunches 
in your company refrigerator— or bring 
a frozen sandwich that will thaw by lunch- 
time. Frozen chicken or turkey is good. 
Bologna keeps well too. When including 
fresh fruits and vegetables— make sure 
they are well-scrubbed. A preservation 
tip for sandwich makers —include high 
acid items containing vinegar, such as 
pickles, Italian salad dressing, etc. to re- 
tard bacteria growth. 

Use your imagination— and follow com- 
mon sense safety rules. You can make 
lunch a fun, delicious and economical meal !

THE NEW YORK TIMES. WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1976 


CONSUMER NOTES 


Discounts for Cash 
Vs. Credit Cards 


By IRVIN 
It has been 2 lmost two 
years since American Ex- 
press agreed to allow mer- 
chants honoring its credit 
cards to offer discounts to cus- 
tomers who paid cash, an ac- 
tion that was applauded by 
consumer groups and fol- 
lowed by a Federal law that 
went into effect last Oclober 
that made' it illegal for a 
credit card company to bar 
its participating merchants 
from offering similar dis- 
counts. 

The American Express ac- 
tion and the enactment of 
the law were championed 
by Consumers Union, were 
both followed by predictions 
by consumer activists of 
widespread discounting and 
by contentions by the credit 
card industry that the effect 
would be negligible. 

Inquiries here and around 
the country in the last two 
weeks failed to turn up any 
evidence of widespread dis- 
counting for cash. Among 
the merchants offering the 
discounts, however, there 
was enthusiasm for the de- 
vice. 

For example, David Reale. 
an executive with Market 
Tire in Washington, said: "I 
am hearing more and more 
from customers, ‘What is 
your discount for cash?’” 

The Discounts Vary 

The normal cash discount 
at Market Tire, Mr. Reale 
said, is 5 percent when the 
concern is conducting sales. 
“We have to pay the credit 
card company for service,’* 
he said. “We would just as 
well lower the price.” 

One of Market Tire’s com- 
petitors. the Stindham Tire 
Company, which has 20 out- 
lets in the Washington area, 
offers a 2 percent discount 
for cash, but this has been 
in effect for 10 years, predat- 
ing the present push by con- 
sumer groups. 

One of the larger organiza- 
tions offering the discount 
is Dorman Winthrop Clo- 
thiers in Los Angeles, whose 
men's clothing stores have 
sales of more than S3 million 
a year and that formerly 
cha'rged credit-card custo- 
mers 3 percent above the 
cost of the clothes. 

"Then I read about Consum- 
ers Union taking on the 
credit-card companies and 
decided to offer discounts 
for customers who paid in 
cash.” said Morton Dorman, 
head of the company. 

Other cash-discounters in- 
clude — the M. & A. Tire Com- 
pany, which offers a 4 per- 
cent discount at its three 
Long Island stores: the Old 
Town Bookworks in Alexan- 
dria. Va., whose manager. 
Sandy Baylis, said "we donT 
give it to discourage credit 
cards — it's a good selling 
point." and 4 - Day Tire 
Stores, an Sll-million-a-year 
concern that has 20 outlets 
in California and Texas and 
whose president. Don Carr, 
said of cash -discounting. 
“We started it." 

‘Starting to Spread' 

Mr. Carr, whose company 
also has an interest in the 
three Len Kenneth's Golf 
Stores in Southern Cali- 
fornia. which also offer dis- 
counts for cash purchases, 
said of the device. •'It's cer- 
tainly starting to spread.” 

If 'it is spreading, it does 
not appear to have had a 
big impact in the metropoli- 
tan area, which comes as 
no surprise to the credit-card 

industry. 

“It has not caught on." 
said H. Spencer Nilson, who 
publishes a newsletter about 
the credit-card business. 

*7 predicted [when Ameri- 
can Express agreed to allow 
the discounts} that the dis- 
counts would not be used 
by more than 1 percent of 
merchants. And that is gen- 
erous " 

Mr. Nilson's opinion was 
echoed by John Keane, a 
spokesman for BankAmeri- 
card, who said. “I don't think 
there's been much effect at 


*fiK- 


MO LOTS KY 

all — we’ve achieved our 
growth goal,” and Jess Greg- 
ory' of American Express, 
who said: “There has been 
no impact on us. What we’re 
learning is what we suggest- 
ed: The theory doesn't work 
very' well." 

What Mr. Nilson and the j 
credit card companies see J 
as the flaw in the theory 
is this ' contention: The 
merchant loses money by of- 
fering cash discounts; it is 
not simply a shift of the | 
credit Fee from the card com- j 
pany to the customer. 

'Flaw* in Discounting 
They say that the cash j 
discount would have to be 
paid by the merchant not I 
only to the would-be credit 
card customer, but also to 
the large number of people I 
who would have paid in cash ! 
anyway. While the merchant i 
would break even by giving a | 
discount to a would-be credit I 
card customer who paid cash. ' 
he would lose in the trans- I 
action that would have been | 
cash anyway. I 

One leading Congressional 
proponent of cash discount- 
ing. Representative Frank 
Annumio. Democrat of Illi- ; 
nois. remains optimistic, as- ] 
serting that a lack of public ; 
awareness is the main reason 
that cash discounts were not 
being offered widely. 

“There is no way to force 
merchants to give cash dis- i 
counts." said Mr. Annunzio, j 
chairman of the House's Con- 
sumer Affairs Subcommittee, j 
“but my belief is that if just ; 
a few" restaurants, depart- ! 
mem or appliance stores in i 
tech community began ad- 1 
vertising that they offer the 1 
discounts, the competition 
for the increased cash volume | 
would automatically make 1 
other merchants want to of- : 
fer the cash discounts, too." i 

Taking the Pulse 
Of Medical Field j 

An organization called : 
Consumers Center for Health ' 
Information is being formed ' 
by two existing groups. Con- ; 
sinner Action Now and the ; 
Scientists Institute for Public . 
Information. i 

According to Consumer j 
Action Now. the center will : 
provide information on the i 
most often prescribed drugs 
3nd the most common sur- 1 
gical procedures, and in Tor- ■ 
mat ion will be made available | 
on such topics as how to j 
choose a doctor, nutrition, | 
prescriptions and how to file : 
a complaint against a doctor. 1 
Further information may ■ 
be obtained by writing to ; 
Consumer Action Now. 30 
East 63th Street, New York ; 
City. N.Y. 10021. 

How to File a Case 

Against a Lawyer 

For those who have no 
problems with their doctors. 1 
but are unhappy with their I 
lawyers, a booklet has been j 
puhiished entitled “How to 
Complain About Your Law- j 
ver." 

Some examples of unethi- 
oal conduct that may result 
in disciplinary action against , 
lawyers’, the" booklet says, ; 
are neglecting a case, misin- 
forming a client of the case's : 
progress and misusing a . 
claimant's funds. 

“ir a lawyer who did legau 
work for \ou caused you 
financial harm, you can sue ' 
for damage." "the bookie; 
Mates, but it warns: "Yom 
chances nf winning are no- 
usually good, and it is ofteu 
d: flic ult to find another law 
ver to take the case 
enurt." 

Therefore the booklet rec- 
ommends filing a complaint 
to prevent future unethical 
conduct by lawyers, and it j 
tells how one may proceed. 
Copies of the booklet may ' 
be obtained by sending 23 
cents and a stamped, self-ad- 
dressed envelope to the New' 
York Public Interest Re- ;

H Sfns! LtiTshe assured 

Jr p 

"at 



the room Ruth 
ky nodded. Her hus- 
ras being treated for 


an acute medical problem. 

"But it’s not so much an- 
ger, 1 " she said. “You're de- 
pressed. You keep running. 
Your whole life is stopped. 
It's revolving around the per- 
son who is ill. You're waiting 
for something the doctor can 
tell you that will give you 
some hope." 

“It would certainly case 
some of the feelings of the 
relatives, if. there was more 
communication with the doc- 
tors," her brother * in - law, 
Harvey, said. 

Repeatedly, the matter of 
communication between fam- 
ilies and physicians came 
up. expressed as the most 
vital source of moral support. 

“You hesitate to bother 
the doctors," raid Mrs. Mur- 
phy whose husband of 32 
years was anticipating a heart 
valve replacement in the near- 
future. “But I just had to 
know if he was better or 
worse. The doctor was in the 
elevator, but he came over 
and talked to me. It was like 
lifting 50 pounds off my 
shoulders." 

And after they've spoken 
wiLh the doctor and know 
the facts, the family members 
go back to the bedside. And 
what do they talk about? 
The weather? 

“You don't want to keep 
the talk on his illness/ 1 said 
Mrs. Zamelsky. 

“But sometimes you have 
to speak of things that arc 
not pleasant,” Mrs. Murphy 
said. “And when my husband 
wants to talk about certain 
important matters, 1 let him 
talk. And when he wants 
to face the fact, I let him 
face it. You have to keep 
a grip on yourself and let 
them get it out of their sys- 
tem.” 

Trying not to show their 
feelings. Everyone In the 
room, it seemed, had some- 
times failed at that «— and 
sometimes succeeded. 

“When I see him with all 
those gadgets. I hurt, but 
I don't want to show him, 1 ' 
a young woman said.- "But 
I want to tell him he has 
every right to feel bad. You 
want to help and you don't 
know how to help.” 

Such feelings of helpless- 
ness can be assuaged in the 
group discussion. One person 
may suggest how he or she 
has found ways to help the 
patient. ("Jusi hold his hand 
very tight," a man suggest- 
ed.) 

Although families inev- 
itably sometimes get in Uie 
way of the split-second land 
: of responses the staff must 
_make to sudden changes in 
the patient’s condition, 
JoAnne Ferguson, the inten- 
rstve care unit's head nurse, 
explained how the family’s 
Intimate knowledge- of the 
.patient can help the staff. 

• '“Families can often tell 
us something about the pa- 
tient," she said. "If there 

• has been a change, they may 
notice it — for instance if the 
patient has become a little 
confused. Their perceptions 
can help the doctor or nurse." 

. "But we tell them not to 
keep watching the intraven- 
ous dripping,” she added. 

“ 'just- talk to him,’ we say/’ 


Nurses in me unit are ex- 
pected to attend at least one 
of the weekly meetings. 

"They all come back with 
the feeling of what it’s like 
to be out there sitting in 
that solarium, waiting and 
wondering what’s going on/' 
Mrs. Ferguson said. “I think 
after the meetings they're 
more in tune with the fam- 
ilies.” 

Whether reelings are under 
control or openly expressed, 
they take their toll. “Some 
families can cope very well 
with stress— there are women 
who needlepoint like crazy." 
Mrs. Ferguson said, “But 
when the tension level is way 
up, we sometimes ask the 
doctor to spend a little extra 
time with the family." 

The level of stress Is some- 
how reduced when people 
hear others describe Lhe 
same anxieties. And the re- 
alization may dawn that 
someone else's loved one was 
in worse shape than one's 


own — and got boner. The 
patient and his illness are 
put in same kind of perspec- 
tive, Miss Brody pointed out. 

“The meetings are a means 
of sharing feelings and infor- 
mation/' she said. "And they 
help us recognize some of 
the individual problems that 
we might not have been 
aware of.” 

What kind of advice would 
these experts- in dealing with 
stress have for the family- 
in such a crisis? 

Miss Brodv made some 
points; 

“Take each dav at a time/* 
she suggested, “Take each 
problem as it comes up. Try 
not to keep saying ‘what 

if . . / 

“Seek help from the staff. 
If you have questions, ask 
them. And ask to see the 
social worker. Because when 
you get lost in your fears, 
you don’t know- where you 
end. and someone else be- 
gins." 


Equal-Pay Case: Billions at Stake 


LUXEMBOURG, March 16 (UPIJ— 
The Advocate General of the Eu- 
ropean Court of Justice has called 
on the court lo rule that European 
women be given equal pay for equal 
work— and make it retroactive to 
19S2. 

In most cases, the court, which 
has jurisdiction over the nine Com- 
mon Market nations, follows the Ad- 
vocate General’s recommendation. If 

it agrees with him in this case, 
it could cost European governments 
billions of dollars in back pay. 

A decision is expected within a 
month. 

The case involves a suit by a 
former Belgian airline stewardess. 
GabricLZe Defrenne, who says her 
pension was less than a man in 
her job would have received. She 
appealed to the European court for 
back pav after a Belgian court reject- 
ed her case. 


The amount of money involved 
Li Mrs. Defrenne’s case is small, 
bu: if the court sets the precedent, 
women ail over Europe could file 
similar suits and strain — if not break 
— the budgets of seme European com- 
panies and governments. 

The Advocate General. Alberto 
Trabucchi. is not a lawyer for either 
side but a court official whose job 
is to summarize the issues and the 
law and to recommend a decision. 

Mrs. Defrenne based her case on 
Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome— 
the Common Market “constitution*’ — 
which calls for “the application of 
the principle that men and women 
should receive equal pay- for equal 
■work." 

The Belgian airline, Sabcna. backed 
by lawyers from Britain and Ireland, 
argued that this article was only 
a principle and needed national laws 
to give it force. 

But Mr. Trabucchi said Article 


1 19 "created rights for the individual 
workers which national courts shall 
protect without awaiting implement- 
ing enactments, whether of national 
or of community origin.” 

He added that this principle “had 
to be applied from tbe end of the 
first stage [of the integration of the 
original six members of the Common 
Market] — i.e., from Jan. I, 1963.” 

The original six members were 
Belgium, France. West Germany, Ita- 
ly, Holland and Luxembourg. Britain, 
Ireland and Denmark joined in 1973, 
and any back pay assessed against 
them presumably would be retroac- 
tive to then. 

Mr. Trabucchi added only one con- 
dition — “that equal work means 
identical work and not merely com- 
parable work.*’ This could hamper 
Mrs. Defrenne's case unless she could 
show that Sabena male stewards 
doing identical work received higher 
pensions.

Child-Care Course: No Credits, but a Boon for the Student 


Jaime Keating bathing her doll 


By GEORGE VECSEY 

SpeaUJ to The N nr York Tlnm 

HEMPSTEAD, L. T.. — If 
word gets out; this could 
be the most popular course 
at Hofstra University— danc- 
ing, painting, snack and play- 
ing outdoors when the 
weather is good. 

Unfortunately for college- 
age aspirants, th is course is 
open only to children from 
ages 3 to 5 whose parents 
study or work around the 
rumpus. 

Hofstra's cheery Child Care 
Center is one of the newest 
of at least 350 campus-based 
centers around the United 
States — and part of a move- 
ment that is showing its 
worth to educators and 
parents. 

■This place is great,” said 
Tobi Klein, who leaves her 
daughter here while taking 
two courses, “They have 
creative techniques, and my 
daughter loves it. It makes 
it much easier for me to 
go to college. 1 ' 

Made Own Arrangements 

The growth of these cen- 
ters is relatively new. In the 
past, students or staff mem- 
bers with prekindergarten 
children had to make their 
own arrangements with rel- 
atives. babysitters or nurse- 
ry schools. But in the last 
decade, more women have 
returned to college and have 
sought solutions to the child- 
care problem. 

Now there is even a na- 
tional organization of 350 
centers, based in Arlington, 
Va. The National Campus 
Child Care Council was 


founded by Rae Burrell after 
her experiences as a student 
and mother in California. 

“It used to make me mad 
to see the football players 
eating steaks on school funds 
while working mothers had 
no place to leave their chil- 
dren while they went to 
class,” Miss Burrell said 

"If the school cut back 
on funds, we’d give aH our 
children Fopsicles and march 
them into the president’s of- 
fice. Or we’d close our center 
am i our mothers would take 
the children to class. The 
teachers would call up the 
president and say, ‘Hey, 
these kids are driving us 
nuts.” 

As a result of efforts 
around the country, colleges 
began setting up vastly dif- 
ferent centers. Some were 
financed through college or 
private sources with modem 
buildings and large staffs. 
Others had to charge up to 
$1.50 an hour and existed 
on the frantic efforts of 
parents- 

“Each group must learn 
to work witlun the forces 
on the campus community,” 
said David Lichtenstein, who 
runs four separate centers 
at the State University of 
New York at Stony Brook. 

“It is almost a clkhfi, but 
centers are in trouble in the 
Northeast, while the South- 
west and California are far 
ahead.” 

"There are two basic 
thoughts about centers,” Mr. 
Lichtenstein continued. “Pub- 
lic colleges tend to see 
these centers as part of the 


academic and research role, 
while private colleges tend 
to stress the service aspect. 
My reading is that private 
schools are more in need 
of students, so they offer 
the center as an induce- 
ment.” 

Mr. Lichtenstein said he 
is concerned about industry 
or schools offering child-care 
centers as a service because, 
be said, “It could be exploita- 
tive as a fringe benefit — 
keeping them in a job or 
school they don’t want. Child 
care should be available to 
everybody." 

73 Before Hofstra 

But until that day comes, 
individual schools are trying 
to cope. On Long Island, 
where many colleges are 
within easy commuting dis- 
tance, three schools preceded 
Hofstra into the child-care 
area. Adel phi’s, open for two 
years, has 90 children en- 
rolled, some for 40 hours 
a week. Stony Brook has 
150 at four centers around 
campus. The State University 
of New York at Old West- 
bury has a nonprofit co-op 
with 43 students. 

From 1964 through 1973, 
Hofstra sponsored a highly 

regarded nursery school as 
part of its school of educa- 
tion. But when the college 
faced a financial crisis (it 
has dismissed nearly 200 
staff members this school 
year), it closed down the 
nursexy. 

However, as enrollment 
dwindled, Hofstra also found 
empty classrooms in the edu- 
cation building. The former 
director of the nursery, Dr. 


Bruce Grossman, decided to 
run a child-care center both 
as a service and for the 
benefit of education students 
— “actually to see children 
in the flesh,” Dr. Grossman 
explained. 

He hired Carol Keyes, a 
mother of three children who 
was returning to work. The 
center started with three en- 
roll ees in September; it now 
has 25. The parents drop 
the children off at staggered 
hours with a limit of three 
hours, since the center does 
not extend to full-time stu- 
dents or workers. . 

“Some parents meet their 
kids for l unch. They brown- 
bag it on campus or they 
buy lunch nearby,” said Dr. 
Grossman. “It keeps the 
parents and children close. 

I don’t think it’s a good 
idea for children and parents 
to be isolated all day.’ 

The parents seem pleased 
that the center is keeping up 
with the high standards of 
Hofstra's former nursery. 

“My son was bored at an- 
other school,” said Jo Perpig- 
nano-Humphreys, wife of a 
Hofstra teacher and herself 
a yoga instructor. “My son 
was very introverted. But 
here I think he has a crush 
on Mrs. Keyes. And he loves 
to paint.” 

“J was leaving my daughter 
with my mother and my 
mother-in-law,” said Janet 
Kapelas, a student at nearby 
Nassau Community College. 
“But when I learned we were 
allowed to use this center, 

I was delighted. Even when 
I don't have classes, Alyssa 
makes me bring her here.”

said many of his 
“ ‘ i.f, rs. former dashiki

.African styles for three- 
piece suits. 

"My customers who usei 

to wear them were college 
sradenrs and very much into 
the political struggle of the 
late 60's," he said. “But now 
they are professional people 
and they dress like profes- 
sional people. But you can't 
really say that the dashiki 
is dead: the college students 
are still wearing them. 1 
don’t see them as much as 
before, though.” 

But one young man. a 
professional photographer, 
said that his dashikis are 
still part of his ‘'working 
wardrobe." 

Comfortable and Loose 

“I was turned on to the 
dashiki and other African 
clothing through politics," he 
said. "But now I wear them 
because they are comfortable 
and because I like the loose 
feeling and cuL I'll always 
wear them and I think others 
will too." 

While the dashiki ap- 
parently no longer has the 
fashion clout it used to, its 
impact can’t be denied. Mr. 
Morgan noted that the dashi- 
ki started the trend toward 
loose-fitting, casual shirts for 
men. and two pattern-making 
companies, Butterick and 
Simplicity, responded to the 
demand for the African-In- 
fluenced shirt. The dashiki 
shirt pattern is still part of 
their stylebooks. 

The exotic African caftans, 
jheDabas and robes that were 
almost as prevalent as the 
dashikis also seem to have 
faded from view, at least 
for daytime wear. It's for

—particularly where supplies 
are heavy — there will be 
notable price relief for the 
consumer." 

In the supermarkets, food 
prices during the first half of 
the year are expected by the 
department's economists — 
who have been forecasting 
the level of food prices 
with considerable accuracy 
throughout the inflationary 
period-— to rise around 1 per- 
cent each quarter and to av- 
erage about 6 per cent over 
the level of prices a year 
earlier. 

During the second half of 
the year food prices will be 
heavily influenced by two 
factors. Both are difficult to 
forecast, but their possible 
extreme levels are capable of 
being roughly estimated by 
projection.. 

One is the weather and 
crop conditions during the 
1976 growing season; the 
other is the speed of recovery 
in the economy as a whole. 
At the present rue of re- 
covery, persona! purchasing 

power after taxes could rise 
as 'much as 4 percent this 
year, compared to a small 
rise last year and a 2 percent 
decline in 1974. 

- Other Possibilities 

Given average weather and 
crop conditions, national 
crops could be large, and if 
they coincided with large 
world crops, further increases 
is production of livestock- 
related foods and moderate 
economic growth, the rise in 
retail food prices would be 
further slowed in the latter 
part- of the year. 

In the New York-north- 
eastern New Jersey area 
food-price increases were 
lower than in the country as 
a whole in the last three 
years. During the 1967-1972 
period, according to Herbert 
Bienstock. regional Commis- 
sioner of Labor Statistics, 
food prices in New York rose 
5.2 percent a . year dmpared 
to 4.3 percent in the country 
as a whole. Then the rela- 
tionship changed. 

In 1973 the. Increase here 
averaged 13.1 patent, and 
14.5 percent nationally: in 
. 1974 it was 14.2j^rcent here 
■and 14.4 percem. nationally, 
and in 1975 it was 8.1 per- 
cent here and S.5 percent na- 
tionally. 


women save their African- 
styled fashions. 

The natural or Afro hair 
style is still the undisputed 
favorite among most blacks, 
both men and women. But 
now they’re shorter — at both 
uptown and midtown hair 
salons and barber shops, sty- 
lists are clipping Afro'ed 
heads closer, some to within 
an inch or two of the head. 

"The natural is here to 
stay,’’ said Geneva Wheeler, 
who owns and manages Le 


Zebre hair salon on 57rh 
Street. Miss Wheeler opened 
Le Zebre two yein ago to 
cater to the hair and bcauiv 
needs of black women, but 
men also come to her shop 
to have their hair styled. 

"Straight hair is coming 
back,” Miss Wheeler contin- 
ued. "but the ‘fried, dyed, 
laid-to-the-side’ loo* is not 
what black women want 
now. They want cuts and 
styles that give them versa- 
tility and freedom to change. 


To go natural one day, have 
a cap of cjris the next and 
then perhaps cornrows with 
beads, ribbons or silk threads 
for ar. evening party look." 

The straight styles may 
be gaining strength, but the 
women wno line up for corn- 
row braids in Bob Keys's 
shop on 135th Street tesirfy 
to the continued popularity 
of tiie African - influenced 
style. 

“I think versatility and 
easy care of the cornrow 
styles are the reasons that 
thev have remained popular 
with some women,” observed. 
Sonia Bullock as she wove 
strands of synthetic hair into 
Barbara Bure's own for a 
long cornrow hairdo- 

What's Important 

"They can be dressed up 
or down and usually last 
. for two or three weeks." 
added Alaine Thompson, an- 
other com row stylist at Mr. 
Keys's shop. "And I think 
to 'most women that is as 
important as the African look 
they get with tne corn row*." 

Mr. Keys, who also cuts 
and shapes Afros in his snop. 
said that he is also cutting 
them shorter. 

The jewelry and headwraps 
that many women wore with 
their street-sweeping cafians 
and jheflaoas still pack a 
!o: of fashion sower. To their 
current fashions many wom- 
en add their headwraps and 
hea 'i y amber, brass, ebony 
and ivory jewelry'. 

’-we! McCabe, director of 
public information for .New 
York State’s Women’s Divi- 
sion. said she used African 
accessories to complement 
her regular wardrobe. 

*Mv mother and I have 
necklaces in different lengths 
of amber, trading beads and 
brass beads which we share," 


Mrs. McCabe said. ‘They are 
a dramatic contrast for sim- 
ple clothing like, say, turtle- 
necks and blazers." ’ 

The popularity of those 
amber and African bead 
necklaces isn’t limited to the 
women, though- Mrs. Mc- 
Cabe’s husband. Gene, a 
writer and a filmmaker who 
just finished a pilot televi- 
sion comedy for the Public 
Broadcasting Corporation 
about a black high school, 
occasionally wears trading 
bead chockers, though da- 
shiks are no longer part of 
his wardrobe. 

Exotic Touches 

"I don't distinguish be- 
tween my African tilings and 
my regutar clothing and ac- 
cessories," 2 4 -year-old Julie 
Bvackbum said. 

That day Miss Blackburn 
was wearing a silk scarf 
knotted around her head, a 
turtleneck sweater, a brass 
neck ring, 'faded jeans stuffed 
into her boots and a raccoon 

coat. 

Actually, i:'s not iust bUHc 
women who are adding exot- 
ic touches to their basic 
wardrobes. The wrapped 
head has been popular lor 
the past seasvn 'or two and 
the African jewelry has been 
sold in boutiques and depart- 
men: stores r:r the last few 
years. 

"You can a roue and debate 
whether or ns: tile African 
fashions ar; still important 
to most blacks, and depend- 
ing who you talk to they 
either are or they aren't," 
observed on; young man 
who admits pushing his dash- 
ikis to the back of his closet. 
"But the bottom line is that 
most of us just no longer 
feel [he obligation or pres- 
sure to show jLr oo'iTical 
selves through our dress and 
hair styles.”

As a dog goes 
through life, his 
nutritional needs 

change. Read about 
delicious, meaty 
Cycle®- and how these 
four different foods 
meet those changing 
needs as no single 
dog food ever has. 



Cyde’l-for puppies 
(up to 18 months) 

During this 
short time, 
your puppy 
should grow to 
his full adult size. Pound 
for pound, he bums up 
100% more calories than 
he will as an adult. He 
■needs extra protein, and 
about twice the vitamins 
and minerals to build 
muscle and bone. And 
unlike dry puppy foods. 
Cycle 1 comes in tender 
meaty chunks. 


Cycled -for young 
adult dogs ( ages 1 to7) 

Cycle '2 is 
specifically 
formulated for 
your dog's peak 
years. Tor the 
way his body 
bums up energy and uses 
protein. With the correct 
balance of vitamins and 
minerals to help keep him 
trim and fit. (And the good 
meaty taste it takes to keep 
him happy.) 




Cyde*3-for 
overweight dogs 

A few excess 
pounds can 
be unhealthy 
for your dog. He' 
may not appear 
overweight, so check with 
your veterinarian. If your 
dog is overweight, he 
should be fed Cycle 3. Its 
tasty formula contains 
less fat and 20% fewer 
calories than the leading

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1976 






Turkish and Chinese Snails Taking Over the French Market 



". j' i_». 


By ANDREAS FREUND 

Special to Hie Nnr York Tines 

PARIS, March 16— There 
has long been a kind of pride 
here in producing what 
Frenchmen call the world’s 
best snails, but it has turned 
oat that most French snails 
in fact come from Turkey, 
and some from China and 
elsewhere. In addition, what 
are sold as French “burgundy 
snails" most likely come 
from Savoy these days. 

Attention was drawn to 
this situation by a recent 
survey in Alsace following 
reports of stepped-up imports 
of snails from China and 
Formosa. The survey find- 
ings were startling. 

It was found that in the 
annual production of 5,000 
tons of canned snails, only 
5 percent are French snails. 
About 60 percent are Turkish, 


and Chinese snails repre- 
sent 4 percent. The remain- 
ing portion, consists of snails 
from West Germany, else- 
where in Western Europe, 
Greece and Algeria, and less- 
er quantities from Senegal 
and Morocco. 

The decline of the Burgun- 
dy snail in the early 1960’s 
came with more extended 
tilling in the area and in- 
creasing use of insecticides. 
The tilling killed many of 
the snails hibernating in the 
ground, and the insecticides 
killed the snails’ staple food. 

Before that snails had been 
plentiful. Pierre Troisgros, 
one of the brothers who run 
the noted restaurant in the 
Burgundian city of Roanne, 
recalled in a telephone con- 
versation that children used 
to pick up snails on their 
way home from school, with 


some eating as many as 150. 
“Simply boiled, of course," 
Mr. Troisgros added. “No 
butter.” 

Following the near-extinc- 
tion of the Burgundy snail, 
businessmen in Paris discov- 
ered Turkey as a producer. 
They invested heavily in 
plants processing the unsea- 
soned snail meat and had 
it shipped to France. 

By 1968, Turkey had prac- 
tically cornered the market 
here in snails. The price for 
one kilogram (Z2 pounds) 
of snail meat was then about 
$ 2 . 

The Turks gradually raised 
their price to $5.40 in the 
following two years and im- 
porters decided to find other 
sources of supply. 

One of them was Albert 
Mai Tam, who specializes 
in imports from the Far East. 


He traveled to China, signed 
an agreement, and two years 
later a new Chinese snail 
meat industry was in opera- 
tion turning out little plastic 
bags with the product frozen 
for shipment to France. The 
price: $2.20, compared to the 
Turkish price that had by 
then risen to $6.75. 

The scientific name of the 
Chinese snail is Acfaatina fu- 
lica, and the Customs Depart- 
ment has demanded that 
cans with the Chinese pro- 
duct bear the inscription 
“escargot azatme." The re- 
quirement has been met, but 
with printing so small it can 
hardly be read. 

Opinions on the taste of 
Turkish and Chinese versus 
French snails differ widely. 
There is an almost instinctive 
dislike of the imports, but 
in a recent test meal present- 


ed here to a tester who is 
the son of a snail breeder, 
he guessed wrong about the 
country of origin of what 
he ate two times out of three. 

Many lovers of snails con- 
sider what basically counts 
is the sauce with them and 
how it is seasoned. At the 
Troisgros brokers’ restau- 


rant, the recipe is to use 
white wine, shallots, parlsey, 
garlic, salt and pepper. 

When Claude Terrail, own- 
er of Paris's three-star Tour 
d’ Argent Restaurant, was 
asked bow he served snails, 
he was a little shocked. “We 
serve no snails at aU," he 
said "because garlic is 


Panned from my restaurant.” 

But Mr. Terrail has an 
interest in L’Escargot, a res- 
taurant specializing in snails 
that he said he still got in 
small quantities from the few 
remaining producers in Bur- 
gundy. Not so Mr. Troisgros, ■ 
who ‘gets his from Savoy,_ 


sow the major prod 
province. 

But in Savoy, too, 
is a problem becaus 
Swiss poachers who 
in the guise of tourists ; 
the nearby border and 
put in a hard day's 
to take away masse 
snails.

SPRING IS COMING 
and soon Lamb will be 
gamboling in 

.‘ S-PB the Meadows 

There’s no gambling with Gristede’s Bee\ 

... it’s U.S.D.A. Prime- the grade that has been and still is the highest grade 
Should you buy U.S.D.A. Choice Beef the odds are in your favor 
(3 chances out of 4) that you’ll get a quality equal to the old Choice quality 
before the grading change, BUT — there is still a chance (1 out of 4) that 
you’ll get beef marked Choice that formerly would have been the lower 
grade of U.S.D.A. Good. That’s gambling— you pay your money and take - 
your chances. 

If you’re inclined to gamble, we suggest you confine it to Las Vegas or 
the local O.T.B. There is no place for gambling in the kitchen or at the 
dinner table. You have virtually nothing to gain and everything to lose. 

You can’t go wrong when you buy the best.

The relatively strong show- 
ing by tabic wines is the 
most heartening sign of all. 
Zt shows that Americans are 
continuing to become wine 
drinkers and that economic 
conditions have not seriously 
affected that trend. Indeed, 
even during the worst part oF 
the wine slump, the amount 
of table wine entering dis- 
tribution channels continued 
to increase. 

A Heartening Sign 

Incidentally, statisticians 
used the term "entering dis- 
tribution channels" because 
it is a more accurate gauge 
of what is going on than pro- 
duction figures and because 
it is easier to compile than 
other data. 

The Impact figures show 
that table wines continued 
last year to increase their 
share of the United States 
marker. They now account 
for 5S percent of wines en- 
tering distribution, up from 
57 percent in 1974. Dessert 
wines were at 18 percent, 
down from !9: vermouth was 
steady' at 3 percent, spar- 
kling wines were down to 5 
percent from 6 percent in 
1974, and special naturals 
were up from 15 to 16 per- 
cent. 

The most interesting trend 
developed in these figures 
was the performance of Cali- 
fornia wines. They were up 


from 249 million gallons in 
1974 to 273 million, an in- 
crease of 9 percent. Wines 
from other states were off S 
percent and imports were 
down 4 percent from the pre- 
vious year. 

Wines from "other states" 
means New York primarily 
and it was the third year 
in a row of decline for these 
wines from their J972 peak. 
For imports, it was the sec- 
ond year of decline from 
a 1973 peak. About 45 mil- 
lion gallons of wine from 
states other than California 
entered United States distri- 
bution channels. The peak 
in 1972 was 52 million gal- 
lons. 

Imports last year totaled 
49 million gallons of wine, 
in 1973 the figure was 55 
million. 

The import figures, accord- 
ing to Impact, would have 
shown a much more serious 
decline had it not been for 
large increases in shipments 
here of Italian and German 
wines. Apparently, importers 
are still working ofi large 
inventories or French wines 
acquired in f he buying rush 
of the early J 370’s. 

• 

Several weeks ago much 
of this space was given over 
to a discussion of the prob- 
lems of small wineries in 
New York State, many of 


■“Wine Sale™*" 
HAROLD BEARAK 


which problems from archaic 
and repressive state laws. 

The discussion noted that 
the small wineries were 
working on the passage of 
a bill that would reduce state 
license fees and give them 
some other commercial ad- 
vantages they do not now 
enjoy, it also noted that the 
small wineries had long com- 
plained that the larger win- 
eries in the state had worked 
against them. 

William Fox, manager of 
winery' public relations ax 
.the Pleasant Valley Wine 
Company of Hammondsport, 
one of New York's best- 
known labels, has taken 
strong exception to that con- 
tention. 

Proposed Benefit 

According to Mr. Fox, 
many executives of the 
-state's larger wine companies 
have worked to support the 
so-called fram winery bill, 
which would reduce licensing 
fees for smaller wineries, 
“with a desire to see all 
grape growers benefit." 

Mr. Fox added that it was 
the larger wineries in the 
state who pioneered in the 
development of the French- 
American hybrid varieties 


of grapes that the smaller 
wineries now use almost ex- 
clusively. 

The established wine pro- 
ducers also open "continui- 
ty of supply, quality and 
taste," Mr. Fox said, and 

"are part of the industry' 

that pays the taxes to help 
the New York State econo- 
my." Furthermore, he said 
they contributed to the Ge- 
neva (N. Y.) Experimental 


Station "for the betterment 
of wine making for all." 

He agreed with the con- 
tention of some of the small- 
er wine producers that New 
York's wine Industry lagged 
behind other states, and he 
suggested tha; part of the 

reason was that “writers 

in other states now support 
the efforts of their states' 
wine industry, but we in 
New York are not so fortu- 
nate."

out to be a "false economy” 
that nullified budgetary and 
administrative controls, con- 
tributed' to bad morale at 
headquarters and created a 
category of school employees 
who were serving at head- 
quarters far longer than they 
originally-intended to. 

Now' a proposal far chang- 
ing the practice— by estab- 
lishing new categories of 
headquarters employees 
colled education administra- 
tors and education adminis- 
trator associates— has been 
advanced by . the deputy 
school chancellor, Bernard R. 
Gifford, and is currently un- 
der study by the policymak- 
ing Board of Education. 

More Than Tides 

Dr. Gifford’s proposal — 
which, be said, was prompted 
by the Sirayer-Yavner report 
— involves more than creat- 
ing two new series of job 

titles. It is a comprehensive 
concept intended to attract 
retain and reward highly 
competent pedagogical per- 
sonnel for headquarters posts 
and, at the same time, to 
prevent the development of 
a new self - perpetuating 
bureaucracy. 

The proposed new job titles 
—the education administra- 
tors series' for line or supervi- 
sory positions, the associate 
senes for staff positions — 
would be neither purely ped- 
agogical nor administrative. 
Educators would be assigned 
to these positions at a level 


and salary commensurate 
with their responsibilities. 

No tenure would be grant- 
ed in the new titles. The 
position would be periodical- 
ly evaluated and those em- 
ployees who ore dropped or 
who want to leave can re- 
turn in the case of teachers, 
to their former district or, 
if supervisors, to whatever 
citywide vacancy exists. But 
the new system also provides 
a career ladder with opportu- 
nities for advancement. 

Under the current practice 
there are educators in bead- 
quarters positions who often 
do the same work as their 

non - pedagogical colleagues 

but who, because of their 
school titles, frequently re- 
ceive far higher salaries and 
sometimes longer vacations. 
The proposed new system 
would end such inequities. 

It is now also possible 
for an acting assistant princi- 
pals or acting principals as- 
signed to a headquarters du- 
ties to receive their per- 
manent licenses and earn 
tenure as school supervisors 
on the basis ot their perform- 
ance In the nonschool jobs. 
The proposed system would 
rule this out 

Dr. Gifford's plan is also 
intended to be fair to educa- 
-tors working “out of title” 
at headquarters who now of- 
ten do not receive the profes- 
sional recognition and status 
they deserve. For example, 
there is a high-school mathe- 
matics teacher who is work- 


ing with systems managers 
and analysts on a computer- 
ized pupil-personnel evalua- 
tion program. The employee’s 
job title — “teacher-assigned” 
— does not reflect this. 

Even more important. Dr. 
Gifford said, the new plan 
would provide a means of 
attracting new headquarters 
personnel. The plan calls for 
public notice of vacancies, 
screening of applications and 
interviews with qualified 
candidates. In the past, many 
got their assignments at 
headquarters on the basis 
of a recommendation by col- 
leagues or because they 
knew the right person.

Enrollment in Roman 
Catholic schools in the Unit-

The Board of Education 
yesterday dropped its court 
action to compel protesting 
parenls to end their occupa- 
tion of administrative offices 
at five public schools in Com- 
munity School District 3 on 
the West side. 

The parents, who started 
the protest at Public School 
ST on. March S and expanded 
it to four other schools last 
Friday, are objecting to the 
central beard's action in 
shortening the school days 
of pupils mice a week as 
an economy measure. 

A central board spokesman 
said that the court suit seek- 
ing an injunction against the 
parents had been withdrawn 
because the order to shorten 
school time had been com- 
plied with and that the dis- 
trist had given assurances 
that the parents' action 
posed no threat to the safety 
of children or interfered with 
their education. - 

The other schools in the 
protest are P-S. 9. p.S. 75, 
P.5. 84 and P.5. 166.

MdL, who is its editorial 
chairman, said its purpose 
was to train students in the 
publishing business and to 
provide an outlet for young 
writers among others. The 
venture is giving the students 
an immediate lesson in the 
economics of publishing — 
they are now trying to raise 
about S 15.000 in contribu- 
tions to finance the first 
three books.

Usery Sees Wages in ’76 
Increasing by 8% to 9% 


THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 1976 



By GENE SMITH 

Secretary of Labor William 
J. Useiy Jr. reiterated his belief 
here yesterday that wage In- 
creases negotiated this year un- 
der major labor contracts wiii 
average “on the order of 8 
to 9 percent" 

The secretary had told the 
Senate Budget Committee last 
December that he agreed with 
economists that such pay in- 
creases would fall “in the 9-to- 
10 percent range.” 

The latest figure was con- 
tained in the text of his address 
yesterday to the 99th annual 
meeting of the American Paper 
Institute. However, he omitted 
the following paragraph: “An 
average negotiated wage in- 
crease this year might run on 
the order of 8 or 9 percent." 

In an interview following his 
talk, the Labor Secretary said 
he “would stand by that 8 
or 9 percent figure” and added 
that he had left it out “because 
it would need more detail than 
I bad time for.”

Best way out of town? 
Philadelphia. One way. 



A beautiful blonde once drove me to Philadelphia. She also 
drove me to drink. 

(They're the only two things I have to thank her for.) 

I suggest, however, you postpone the deiights to be gained 
from blonde or bottle, and board the next rail car to sanctity and 
sanity on the Delaware. 

Ah, yes: Philadelphia. The firm promise of businessas usual 
and more of the same. A pleasurable paucity of insatiable tax 
mongers. An abundance of fully improved industrial land nearby 


and millions of square feet of office space within. Both available at 
reasonable rates. 

(That’s a diplomatic way of saying cheap money, my friend.) 

Follow, then. Follow by canoe, by ox cart or on foot if not by 
train. Foiiow with blonde, if you insist. Follow your nose to the 
coupon below and forward it for additional information. Tern pus 
fugits. Yes, indeed. 

(Something about the city you're in reminds me of the 
Titanic.)

Tbe latter argument was held to 
have particular importance for the cre- 
ation of a European economic and 
monetary union. 

The American school of. thought, 
held particularly at the -United States 
Treasury, put its major emphasis on 
the importance of preserving ex- 
change-rate flexibility as a means of 
avoiding overvalued or undervalued 
currencies, which led to baiance-of- 
payments disorders for nations and 
eventually to currency crises,- which 
could disrupt world trade and invest- 
ment. . 

Having been through decades of 
Chrome deficit in the United States

were unwilling to see their dollar 
pegged again at si value which, sooner 
or later, they expected to be over- 
valued— as other countries devalued 
against them. 

' The devaluation of the United States 
dollar, starting with the Smithsonian 
agreement of December 1971, achieved 
the desired result of strengthening the 
United States trade position. After an 
initial lag, American exports soared 
from $43.5 billion in 1971 to $107 bil- 
lion in 1975. Inflation accounted for 
some of the surge but far from all. 
Amen can exports increased from 4 
percent of the gross national product 
in 1971 to 7.1 percent of GJMJ*. in 
1975. And- tb'e American balance of 
payments on current account swung 
• into surplus last year after having 
been in deficit continuously s ince foe

yesterday that it intended 
“shortly” to make an offer for

Utilities That Supply Water Raising Rates 


By REGNALD STUART v 

Hie -pace of waiter in going 
up ' in many areas because 
foe nation's water supply 
systems are faced with rising 
operating costs and tough 
new state and Federal water 
quality standards. 

Sizable water rate in- 
creases have been imposed 
in a number of cities and 
towns in rpcent months by 

municipal and privately 
owned water systems. And 
regulatory and industry es- 
timates are that more in- 
creases will be imposed more 


feequentlypn a broader scale 
during foe next five to 10 
years. • <*■ 

The increases range from 
a 39 percent rise by the 
City - of Detroit, which sup- 
plies water te~'neariy half 
the state of Michigan, to 
a 9 percent advance for most 
of the 190,000 customers of 
tbe Southern California Wa- 
ter Company. 

Water systems in the 26 
counties under the juris- 
diction of foe Honda Public 
Sendee Commission recently 
received rate inc re ases aver- 


aging 31 percent, while foe 
90,000 customers of the New 
Haven Water Company in 
Connecticut were issued a 
20 percent rate increase last

‘Ten years from now water 
rates will probably be three 
times what they are today, 
but even at that price it 
is still a good bargain.” said 
Charles E. Woods, president 
of the New Haven Water 
Company. For ■ most of its 
residential customers, foe 
New Haven company’s aver- 
age annual bill ranges from 


$130 to $140. 

The New Haven Water 
Company received its in- 
crease last year on foe heels 
of what Mr. woods described 
as “dramatic” increases m 
all costs since the 1973 oil 
embargo. Although the com- 
pany does not expect to ask 
regulators for another rate 
rise this year. Mr. Woods 
said, substantially more wfll

Advantages of Index Funds Debated 

By ROBERT METZ

8 ways 

DREYFUS 
Liquid Assets 

can work for you 

1 • Earn Income on your cash reserves even 
over short periods of time. 

2. Wrife checks on your Dreyfus Liquid 
Assets account to pay large bills. 

3. Save yourself the trouble of making your 
own money market investments. 

4. Take care of fiduciary responsibilities. 

5. Give yourself a regular monthly income. 

6. Take advantage of current interest rates. 

7. Maintain liquidity and stability. 

8. Diversify your portfolio. 


Pension - fund managers 
have carried on a nervous 
debate over the level of in- 
vestment prudence expected 
of them under the Pension 
Act of 1974. 

One result has been to 
popularize the index fund, 
which is designed to copy, 
through a careful selection 
of stocks, the performance 
of a chosen market index 
to such a degree that there 
will be almost no difference. 

The theory’ is that if the 
portfolio manager does as 
well as a popular representa- 
tive average of important 
stocks suc-h as the Standard 
& Poor 500, he will be above 
reproach — even if the portfo- 
lio and the average it copies 
drop significantly in value. 

• 

In a recent speech at a Fi- 
nancial Analysts Research 
Foundation seminar, Prof. 
Roger F. Murray, who has 
years of experience as a pen- 
s ion- Fund manager, was high- 
ly critical of current interpre- 
tations of the prudence 
expected and of the index 
funds as well. 

Dr. Murray is professor 
of banking and finance at 
Columbia University's Grad- 
uate School of Business. 

In his speech. Professor 
Murray said that the prudent 
need not be brilliant or infal- 
lible as forecasters hut added 
that tolerance of “sheer stu- 
pidity must be limited." 

He said that institutions 
reputed to be thoughtful and 
prudent proceeded in the 
late 1960's to chase the , ‘wi!l- 
o'-lhe-wisp" of instant stock 
gains, leading them to call 
high-risk companies "emerg- 
ing growth stocks" or "spe- 
cial situations." Such practi- 
ces did not establish 
prudence or reduce the expo- 
sure to substantial per- 
manent loss of capital, he 
added. 

• Professor Murray then lev- 
eled a number of criticisms 
at the index fund. He argued 
that it was a mistake to 
invest in an index fund if 
the decision was based on 
the generally better record 
of the Standard & Poor's 500 
stock index in the 1973-74 
bear market. 

He explained that the S. 

& P. was dominated by the 
"very large, financially 
strong companies" of rela- 
tively low volatility and thus 
did better in market declines. 
But the index tends not to 
do so well in rising markets, 
he said. 


Since periods of rising 
prices tend to exceed peri- 
ods of falling prices, invest- 
ing in an index fund, he 
said, is a "formula for a 
solid, consistent long-term 
loser." 

He went on to say that 
while it was undoubtedly dif- 
ficult to beat the perfor- 
mance record of the S. & 
P. over time, the "superior 
37-year record of the Chemi- 
cal Fund suggests that it 
is not impossible.” 

It would be "elementary 
prudence" to reduce a stock 
portfolio’s volatility in high 
markets and increase it when 
the market is low, he said. 

"An index tfund seeks to 
keep volatility, by definition, 
at the market’s level at all 
times," Professor Murray 
said. "The exposure to loss 
of a portfolio when the S. 
&-P. 500 is at 100 in 1972 
somehow seems greater than 
when the index is at 67 in 
1974 and the potential for 
gain the reverse. 

• 

Professor Murray conclud- 
ed that, if one believed that 
common stocks generally 
were undervalued, he should 
not invest in an index fund 
since the fund would be un- 
likely to keep pace with the 
market leaders. 

"If one is not that optimis- 
tic about the stock market, 
he ought to seek an even 
smaller equity proportion, an 
even lower level of volatil- 
ity, and a Irager component 
of fixed-income securities,” 
he added. 

Last week. William L. 
Fouse. vice- president of 
Wells Fargo Investment Man- 
agers. which manages an in- 
dex fund, wrote a six-page 
response to Professor Mur- 
ray's speech. 

Among other things, he 
said that those who bought 
more volatile stocks to 
beat the index were in- 
clined to trade more than 
those managing index funds 
so that their gains were tem- 
pered by substantial broker- 
age fees. 

Mr. Fouse granted that 
Chemical Fund's record of 
superior performance was 
clear-cut but stressed the 
"practical difficulty” of 
identifying the successful 
fund of the future. 

As for the recommendation 
that investors buy stocks 
when they were “low” Mr. 
Fouse again stressed that it 
was not easy without hind- 
sight to know when the 
market was. in fact low.

about the legislation. 

|£e Business Roundtable, an 
organization, of 158 of the na- 
tion largest corporations, in- 
cluding the three largest banks, 
t beli-three largest automobile 
companies, the three largest 
s tegj . companies, seven of the 
larjtest oil companies and ma- 
joiyjetaileTs and utilities, has 
be&f in the forefront of the 
lobbying against the measure. 

'{{|eir principal argument has 
be&r that damage suits of the

seriously damage or even bank- 
ny£[same companies while giv- 
ing* ony individual consumer a 
yeijjj small sum of money.

/feyocates of the bill have 
argned that it will require the 
risl^.ipf just such large damage 
payments to dissuade major 
conjjianies from illegal price- 
furing agreements and other 
antitrust violations.

110 years, and our net plant 
is worth $70 million,” said 
the 49 -year -old executive, 

who has spent 25 years at 
the company. “Over the next 
10 years we will spend about 
$140 million on plant, double 
that of our whole history.” 

At the Southern California 
Water Company, William F. 
Franklin, president, said that 
virtually all water systems 
serving a substantial number 
of customers had expe- 
rienced sharp increases in 
costs from every, direction — 
chemicals to treat water, en- 
ergy to run fkonping stations, 
delivery ■systems, construc- 
tion and labor costs. 

"Before the oil embargo 
the average use per customer 
was about 200,000 gallons 
a year, and that cost them 
$85 to *95,” Mr. Franklin 
said. "Now it costs about 
$108 a year. And that’s likely 
to increase, hinging on infla- 
tion. about 10 percent a year 
for the next five years." 

Although water is still 
cheap when compared with, 
other utility services, the re- 
cent wave of increases and 
prospects for more have ap- 
parently disgruntled consu- 
mers in some areas, accord- 
ing to Eric F. Johnson, execu- 
tive director of the American 
Waterworks Association, the 
principal trade association of 
the nation’s municipally 


owned and privately owned 
water systems. 

Another major concern of 
many water systems in terms 
of rising costs as the Safe 
Drinking Water Act of J974 
and the stringent'- require- 
ments it may pSace-km some 
water systems after enforce- 
ment ot the act begms in. 
1977. Somq states' -.|iave al- 
ready adopted* uniformwater 
quality standards as tough 
as, if not tougher. than, the 
Federal rules. Investments in 
new plant to meet the new 
standards wiH run into bil- 
lions of dollars, industry offi- 
cials say. 

The overall impact on rates 
of the recent increases in 
operating costs and future 
need to install costly water_ 
qua^ty . control systems is 
likely to vary_ from water 
system to water system ' be- 
cause of the industry’s broad 
diversification. 

Most of the nation’s esti- 
mated 40,000 water supply 
systems are municipally 
owned and not all are regu- 
lated by- -state- -regulatory 
bodies. 

. Of- the -roughly 12,300 in- 
vestor-owned water supply 
systems sejyj0g_.aho.ut 40 
million people. 5,100 are 
community systems, 3,800 
are systems for mobilehome 
developments and more than 
3,000 are unclassified, ac- 
cording to the National Asso- 
ciation of Water Companies.

$1 05 Million Stiff Remain- 
Bond Prices Off Slightly 


By JOHN H. ALLAN 
The credit markets gave 
great heave yesterday as they 
worked to move a huge volume 
of financing for all types of 
borrowers — Government agen- 
cies, corporations and states 
and cities. One 
investment banker 
called the corpo- 
rate bond market 
"sloppy" and a tax- 
exempt bond deal-, 
er described his sector of the 
market as "a mixed bag.” The

debenture Issue offered at 
yield of 3.56 percent was re- 
ported by the underw rite rs to 
be 65 percent sold at the end 
of the day. 

Bond prices declined slightly 
in secondary market trading as 
traders and investors sought to 
make sense of the terms of the 
new issues marketed yesterday 
and of the reception that in- 
vestors gave them. On balance, 
the fixed-income markets 


seemed to move toward slightly 
low- 


higher interest rates and 
er prices. 

In the corporate bond market, 
the syndicate of underwriters 
led by Merrill Lynch that priced 
5300 million of Southwestern 
Bell Telephone Company 40- 
year debentures late Monday 
afternoon offered them formal- 
ly to investors yesterday. 

The Southwestern Bell bonds 
carrying an 8±A percent inter- 
est rate and a price of 99.375 
percent of face value, were 
about 65 percent sold, a spokes- 
man for Merrill Lynch reported 
By this estimate, at least $105 
minion of the bonds remain 
in the underwriters' invento- 
ries, hut investment bankers 
asserted that the bonds would 
be sold without changing the 
8.56 percent yield. 

One Corporate Issue 

In the one corporate issue 
priced late in the afternoon 
for sale today, $75 million of 
International Harvester Credit 
Company nates due April 1, 
1984, were given a 9 percent 
interest rate and priced at 100 
percent. The issue, underwrit- 
ten by a Morgan Stanley group, 
is the first by the company 
since Standard & Poor’s down- 
graded its securities to BBB4- 
from A. The company is rated 
A by Moody's. 

The General Motors Accept- 
ance Corporation filed with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission SI 50 million of 10- 
year notes to be offered April 
7 by a Morgan Stanley group. 

in the Government securities 
market, the Treasury an- 
nounced plans to sell $2.5 bil- 
lion of four-year 10% -month 
notes on Wednesday, March 
24. to raise new cash. The 
minimum denomination will be 
SI ,000. 

Treasury Bills 

The Treasury also announced 
that it would sell S5.5 million 
j of bills at its regular weekly 
auction next Monday. The 
amount, SI 00 million less than 
the Treasury sold this week, 
will match the amount of bills 
scheduled to mature March 25. 

In the Federal agency market, 
the Govemmet National Mort- 
gage Association sold $239 mil- 
lion of mortgage-backed 30- 
year securities to a four-man- 
ager group led by Salomon 
Brothers. The investment bank-

Gala Cosmetics Gets New Look jTjiey live their dM 

today, not tomorrov 


By PHILIP H. DOUGHERTY 

A former agency man has 
become United States presi- 
, dent of the Gala Cosmetics 
Group and he's really shaking 
the place up. 

Arthur Heimbold, 41 years 
old, who had worked at 
Young & Rubicam, DKG. and 
Marschalk, became chief op- 
erating officer last summer 
of the division of tbe Smith 
& Nephew Associated Com- 
panies of Britain that has 
been distrubuting and selling 
Mary Quant cosmetics :iere. 

The executive, with the 
company for four years, is 
taking it from a sales -dis- 
tribution-oriented company 
to a true marketing company. 
• 

In the past, Mr. Heimbold 
explained, the American com- 
pany merely bought the prod- 
ucts and the advertising for 
them from the British com- 
pany and moved them into 
the marketplace. What little 
additional trade advertising 
that was needed was done 
in-house. 

Now the operation, which' 
should be renamed Mary 
Quant Cosmetics Ltd. within 
six months, is also develop- 
ing products for its own mar- 
ket and if it can get a better 
deal by having them manu- 
factured here will arrange 
to do so. 

And it has given up. its 
ln-house advertising set-up 
and has retained Trompson 
Monroe Advertising, a small 
shop that specializes in travel 
anti resort advertising. 


Most of the larger agencies 
with cosmetics experience 
couldn't touch Mary Quant 
because of client conflicts, 
Mr. Heimbold said, noting 
that he chose Trompson 
Monroe because of its ability 
to create attractive promo- 
tion packages for travel 
agents — a talent that can 
easily be adapted for Quant 
retailers. 

The media advertising 
budget is only about $750,- 
000, which is spent in the top 
40 markets, he said, but if 
you add in other marketing 
expenses and promotion and 
the co-op program the total 
is more like $900,000. 

The cosmetics line is aimed 
at younger women, which is 
obvious enough from the 
names — Bell Bottom Blues 
and Peppermint Polish eye 
make-up; Gold Digger, Chili 
Crush, Red Hot Mama and 
Choosy Cherrv lipsticks, and 
Big Spender. Flesh Pot and 
Nearly Nude nail polish, for 
example. 

• 

So the media used is 
aimed at them,, too. the 
younger fashion magazines, 
radio and newspapers, in 
markets where the young 
are heavy newspaper read- 
ers. 

What sets the Mary Quant 
line apart from the rest of 
the cosmetics field. Mr. 
Heimbold mainains, is that 
it is generally sold in doth-, 
mb boutiques and hot at 
cosmetics counters in depart- 
ment stores or in drug stores. 

In addition to cosmetics, 
Mr. Heimbold’s company is 
pushing a line of Mary Quant 
fashion accessories inde- 
pendent of its arrangement 
with the British Gala Cos- 
metics Group. They include 
sun glasses, scarves, jewelry, 
lingerie and hats. 

And, said Mr. Heimbold. 
"with the exception of hats, 
they’re all one size fils all." 

Johnston Gets Wall St. Journal 
Jim Johnston Inc., Chapel 
Hill, N. C., which has been 
doing creative advertising as- 
signments for The Wall 
Street Journal, has opened a 
New York office and will 
handle advertising sales pro- 
motion for the newspaper on 
a full-service basis. The ac- 
count. billing about $1 mil- 
lion. was previously at the 
office here of Clinton E. 
Frank Inc., which closed. 
Circulation advertising for 
The Journal is done by Bat- 
ten, Barton, Durstine & Os- 
born. 

James J. Johnston resigned 
suddenly in April 1974 from 
Griswold - Eshleman. Cleve- 
land, where he was president 
and chief executive officer. 

He moved to Chapel Hill and 
opened a creative boutique. 

Welcome back to the rat 
race, Jim.

Crush Adds Two Words 

For its 1976 advertising. 
Crush International, the soft 
drink company, is adding 
two words to last year’s 
theme. “Ask for Crush. The 
Taste That's All Its Own." 
The new words are "It's 
Outstanding." 

The Evanston, III., organi- 
zation is not disclosing what 
its ad budget is. but it does 
say that Lee King & Partners 
of Chicago has prepared, a 
multimedia effort.

Hotel’s View of City 
Is in Eye of Beholder 

New York, too. is in the 
eye of the beholder. 

An ad for the Barclay Ho- 
tel. HI East 48th Street, in 
the March issue of Gulfshore 
Life, which caters to the 
well-tanned and well-fed 
folks who live around the 
Naples area on the west 
coast of Florida, starts out 
this way: 

“New York is breakfast 
with your banker, dinner 
witft your lawyers and trying 
to keep a hundred securities 
analysts from having you for 
lunch." 

“ Hardly the view from 
Eighth Avenue.

End to Lawyer Ad Ban Urged 
Lawyers sorely need a new 
communications link with the 
public, Alexander H. Carver, 
who is both a lawyer and an 
ad agency account super- ' 
visor, testifed the other day. 

Mr. Carver, who is with 
Foote, Cone & BeldJng, was 
urging the New York State 
Bar Association’s Special 
Committee to Review the 
Code of Professional Respon- 
sibility to lift its ban on the 
right of a lawyer to advertise. 

Right now, Mr. Carver said, 
most of the communication 
about lawyers is done by the 
lawyer across the desk to 
his client or in the news 
media and that unusaUy "is 
often [about] an attorney in 
trouble." 

Should the bar decide to 
allow lawyers to advertise 
their services. Mr. Carver 
said, there should be estab- 
lished “a permanent com- 


mittee to advise and counsel 
attorneys on individual ques- 
tions and problems." 

Having conceded that there 
could be ads that would em- 
barrass the profession, he 
added, that those instances 
would be rare. "In the vast 
majority of cases, an attorney 
who can afford to advertise 
will be one who makes a 
good living because he serves 
his client well,” be said.

31 Products on Borden ‘1776’ 
The sole sponsor for the 
television premiere of the 
movie "1776" will be Borden

products from C remora to 
Lustro-Ware housewares. The 
musical story of the second 
Continental Congress will 

• run on the NBCrTV network 
on June 29. Conahy & Lyon

SO A MEDIA SCHEDULE THAT INCLUDES 
PRIME TIME AND PRIME PRINT MIGHT BE AVERY 
PALATABLE SOLUTION TO YOUR MEDIA NEEDS. 


What were trying to say is 
simply this: Although National 
; . :Geogr^)iiie hasa greater circulation 

j“' ; than Time and Newsweek combined, 

- we don r t want to get into a shouting 
match with TV. We J d rather show you 
how muchNationalGeographie can 
add to your television coverage. 

National Geographic can 
complement your television . 
schedule. 

s - If you*re selling a product or a 

service which requires a broad base 
aind huge numbers, television may be 
your primary medium. That's what it 
deKvers best. But if you also need to 
’reach people in the upper income 
groups, National Geographic is the 
first place to look. No other medium is 
so suited for reaching huge numbers 
of people with money to spend. 




Reaching more people who 
watch TV less. - 

Syndicated research proves that 
television viewing drops off among 
people with higher incomes and 
educations. And this is precisely 
where the Geographic’s strength is 
greatest. By adding National . 
Geographic to your TV schedule, you . 
can smooth out and fill in your demo- 
graphics... reach more of the people 
who watch TV less! 

National Geographic goes 
where the money is. 

We have the numbers to prove it. 
The higher the income, the greater 
the Geographic's penetrating power. 
For example, in the top income group 
where TV viewing drops off, National 
Geographic reaches more than eight 
million readers who have a median 
income of $27,638. And our total adult 
audience— 22 million readers— has a' 
median income of $16,696, the highest 
of any major publication in America. 


It’s the logical first choice 
for so many products and 
services. 

You name the product or service. 
Chances are the Geographic will fit its 
demographics better than any other 
major magazine. Particularly when 
you need to reach people with more 
money to spend. 

Right how, by adding National 
Geographic to your present TV 
schedule, your advertising can be 
further optimized by reach, by 
frequency, or a combination of both, 
against your target audience. Check it 
out and see if you don't agree. 

Primetime... 
plus prime print. 

So let the Geographic help put 
you in clover. Combine National 
Geographic with televisionand give 
your advertising message the visual 
immediacy of prime time <md the 
lasting impression of prime print

; About Real Estate 

How Irish Importers 


and Israeli Bagel Makers Find Happiness in Two Neighbor! 


’ By ALAN S. OSER 
J The real-estate people in- 
llsist that location is all-impor- 
tant. Well, sometimes yes, 
■sometimes no. 

s No in the case of the Irish 
Tea Sales Corporation. It is 
“a small importer of delicacies 
Tram the British Isles and 
[operates from the first floor 
*of a three story building on 
95th Avenue in Ozona Park, 
rQueens. Two elderly partners 
.'—John Smith, who is 65 
years old, and Joseph Patrick 
pYloore. 72 — are to be found 
inuch of the time wandering 
.'about among stacked cases 


of imported jams, chocolates, 
cereals, sauces, biscuits, 
pickles and above all teas. 
The strong aroma of tea 
bangs in the air. 

Yes in the case of “Bagels 
and ...” It is a fairly 
new bagel emporium at 51 
Christopher Street in Green- 
wich Village, started by two 
Israelis, David Beit-Halach- 
my, 39, and Reuvin Gershoni, 
33. The Village seemed ready 
for a small but stylish restau- 
rant based on bagels, they 
said amid piped-in Mozart 
. Since today is St Patrick's 
Day, the door will be locked 


at Irish Tea Sales. Mr, Smith 
will be marching on Fifth 
Avenue with the County Ca- 
van Men's Association, which 
he has done steadily since 
2929. Mr. Moore will be with 
the County Westmeath men 
as marshal. He is a former, 
president of their organiza- 
tion. 

But tomorrow, with nor- 
malcy restored, they should 
be back at their posts, filling 
wholesale orders from deli- 
catessens ' and specialty 
shops. They have been there 
for 15 years. 

Actually, the business 


started during the Depression 
on LaSalle Street in Manhat- 
tan, and then moved to York- 
ville and to Jackson Heights, 
where it operated in the 
home of a late partner named 
Benson. Mr. Smith found the 
new quarters, bought the en- 
tire building and now lives 
upstairs with his wife and 
eight children. To loyal cus- 
tomers, the address hardly 
mattered. Mr. Moore joined 
the company 25 years ago. 
“We’re the only two left,” 
he sand. 

It is a neighborhood of 


small houses and small busi- 
nesses cheek by jowl, with 
' Atlantic Avenue a block 
away in one direction and 
Woodhaven Boulevard a 
block away In the other. 
Across the street there is 
a manufacturer of kitchen 
cabinets in a building once 
used by a folding-box manu- 
facturer, and by Canada Dry, 
and long ago by a maker 
of the black pots used m 
coal stoves. 

Mr. Moore got his . start 
selling Shamrock and Pride 
of Erin tea from a suitcase 
■during the Depression, when 


it cost 50 cents a pound. 
The company carries those 
lines still, and also Mc- 
Grath's. Other specialty iir.es 
are Lamb’s and Irish Cottage 
jams and jellies. 

For an importer long in 
business, the old customers 
keep coming back. “This is 
a good neighborhood.” said 
Mr. Smith. 

Mr. Belt-Haiachmy finds 
similar comfort in the Vil- 
lage. He is in the fashion 
business too— he runs the 
Peacock boutique on Green- 
wich Avenue — and he met 
Mr. Gershoni when Mr. Ger- 


shoni had a small belt-de- 
signing company. Mr. Beit- 
Halachmy was a customer. 

They wanted to go into 
the food business together, 
and after some thought, they 
chose bagels. “Bagels have 
been around for a long time 
but thfc concept — sit in and 
take out — is fairly new,” said 
Mr. Beit-Halachmy. “We fed 
people are tired of hambur- 
gers and hot dogs.” 

The partners took a 10-year 
lease on the store, with a 
five-year renewal option, and 


got. a. bank fc

were going somewhere and 
not just boarding the cars for

Each of the city’s new 
downtown hotels, the Omni 
International, {he Peachtree 
Center Plaza and the Atlanta 
Hilton, seems to have taken 
some of its inspiration from 
the Regency, but each in its 
own way, and each in some 
spectacular manner, goes the 
Regency one better. 

The Omni, for instance, Is 
not— nor are any of the other 
new structures— simply a ho- 
tel. The $70-miHion four- 
building complex, of which 
the hotel is a part, also con-

Regency, the glass elevators 
soar up the walls over the 
“great space”. 

The $50-mfllion Peach- 
tree Center Plaza is a 70- 
story, bronzed silver cylin- 
der. The lobby is seven 
storeys high, with diners and 
drinkers perched on concrete 
lily pads anchored on a half- 
acre lake. It is a Portman 
design, and contains shopping 
and entertainment facilities 
as well as 1,070 rooms. 

200 Meetings Booked 

The Atlanta Hilton, de- 
signed as the flagship of the 
chain, is built in a “tri-wing” 
configuration, 29 - stories 
bigh. It has not one, but 
seven, high-rise lobbies, or 
atri ums , as they are called. 
There is the usual comple- 
ment of shops, and seven res- 
taurants, including one called 
“Another World,” where di- 
ners are treated to artificial 
flashes of lightning and 
peals of thunder. 

The $3 5 -mill ion Georgia 
World Congress Center, a 
huge trade and convention 
center buill on 13 acres of 
downtown property adjoin- 
ing the Omni International, is 
expected to provide steady 
business. It boasts the largest 
exhibition floor in the nation; 
the cafeteria can handle 
20,000. Not yet completed, 
the center has already 


rangements of public spaces.

The Peachtree Plaza is the 
first such hotel to be completed 
— there is a similar, but not 
identical, one under construc- 
tion in Detroit and a five-tower 
variation in Los Ange'es — and 
it is unquestionably the most, 
elaborate and most sophisticat- 
ed building Mr. Portman has 
yet built

space as well as anyone 
around. It is too bad that all 
visitors do not enter the hotel 
from the Peachtree Stree: door, 
for that is one of the building's 
best architectural experiences, 
far better than the more fre- 
quently used motor entrance 
around the corner. 

On Peachtree Street a row 
of concrete benches is built 
into the facade, a gracious ges- 
ture and one that clearly af- 
firms the importance of the 
street in what one might call 
the building's value system. 
The benches are broken _ by 
a concrete canopy, the sides 
oF which run down to the 
ground to create a sense of 
enclosure. Another similar 
structure, smaller, is set within, 
focusing the visitor to the cen- 
ter and enclosing him further 
as he enters a long, softly 
lit corridor. 

The corridor is low and lined 
with open shops, - and only at 
the end does one burst through 
into the large and complex 
open space. It is a superbly 
crafted and controlled proces- 
sional experience. 

Mr. Portman has often been 
criticized, and justifiably so, 
for the less than refined details 
of many of his earlier buildings. 
Much of his work has played 
to the grandstand, and this 
has earned him the enmity of 
the members of bis profession 


from the northern half of 
Missouri into southeastern 
Kansas, while light snow oc- 
caurred in upper Michigan 
and Wisconsin. Skies were 
fair from western Minnesota 
through the Dakotas into the 
central Rockies, and also 
across western Texas and the 
southwestern quarter of the 
country. Rain fell along the 
coast of the Pacific North- 
west.

COPENHAGEN, March 16 
. (Reuters) — The Danish Govern- 
ment has decided to let 200 
Vietnamese war orphans stay 
in Denmark as long as they 
wish. Prime Minister Anker 
Jorgensen said today. 

The announcement reversed 
an earlier decision to send them 
back to Vietnam at the earli- 
est possible moment 

Last month the last of the 
Vietnamese children, who ar- 
rived here last April from 
South Vietnam, were removed 
from the care of their guardian. 
Henning Becker, a West Ger- 
man journalist. 

Mr. Becker, originally granted 
guardianship by the new de- 
funct South Vietnamese Gov- 
ernment. fought Danish child 
welfare authorities for custody 
of the orphans for several 
months and opposed govern- 
ment plans to return them to 
: .Vietnam.

e composer's works 
i principally by him- 
‘Fanfare for the Com- 


mon Man” {IMS), “El Salon 
Mexico" (1936), the Hoe- 
down section of “Rodeo** 
(1942) and the suite from 
the opera “The Tender Land” 
(1954-57). 

in addition. Mr. Copland 
is joined by Benny Goodman 
for the Concerto for Clarinet 
and Orchestra, a work that 
the jakz musician commis- 
sioned in 1948. The composer 
and clarinetist last performed 
the concerto together in the 
mid- 1950‘s.

The interview for the Moy- 
ers program was recorded 
last summer in the spectacu- 
lar setting of Aspen, Colo. 
In addition to conversations 
with Mr. Moyers, the com- 
poser chats informally with 
Aspen students and musi- 
cians. Biographical data, be- 
ginning with the fact that he 
was bora in Brooklyn in 1 900. 
are woven into commentaries 
on his ssiaus and passionate 
involvement with music. 

For Mr. Copland, music is 
“emotions, feelings, reac- 
tions,' 1 the totality of which 
"enlarges the listener’s sphere 


Also Focus of ‘Moyers* 
Journal* Interview 


of reference.” The effect of 
this peculiar art is unique. 

Unlike other prominent fig- 
ures in the music world. Mr. 

Copland is hesitant about 
reducing music to music-ap- 
preciation sentences or para- 
graphs. “You limit it," he 
says, when you translate the 
musical experience into 
words. 

He tells an anecdote about 
his score for the film ‘The 
Heiress” to illustrate the 
power of music to control 
the emotions of an audience 
“even when they don't know 
their emotions are being 
played with.” With the orig- 
inal score, a key scene in 
the film provoked unwanted 
laughter. A more dissonant 
score created a more taut 
feeling and, at subsequent 
previews, “there wasn't a 
sound in the house." 

Gentle and soft-spoken, . 

Mr. Copland can almost be Iff/Ii/y’Offir/e 
devilishly droll. Mr. Moyers DZiieve 

reminds him that five years 
ago Leonard Bernstein de- 
clared that Aaron Copland 
has “left the simplicities, he's 


left the great, basic themes 
of his music.” What is the 
composer's reaction? 

Mr. Copland replies: "You 
always take into account 
who says it. Jf Lenny Bern- 
stein says it, he may be in 
a had mood or in a partic- 
ular point in his develop- 
ment where everything that 
he thought was great seems 
less great now. That's al- 
ways possible, you know, 
and he may be right He may 
have exaggerated in the oth- 
er direction. He tends to ex- 
aggerate, anyhow, both 
ways” 

‘■"Copiand” was produced 
and directed for “Bill Moyers' 
Journal” by Wayne Ewing.

paying unjust claims for grain 
losses. 

He noted that in 1974. the 
most recent year for which 
figures are available, the rail- 
road paid more than S20 mil- 
lion in claims for grain lost 
in transit. 

“If the railroads had lost 
as much grain as they have 
paid for, they would need a 
snow plow to clear their 
trades,” said Martin R. Gruber 
Jr., supervisor of weights for 
the Southern Weighing and In- 
spection Bureau, which is sup- 
ported by railroads in the 
south. 

Similar bureaus serve rail- 
roads in other parts of the 
country. They supervise weigh- 1 
ing procedures and weight 
agreements with clients and 
attempt to prevent losses. 

Mr, Gruber testified at a joint 
hearing of two subcommittees 
of the Senate Agriculture Com- 
mittee — the Subcommittees on 
Foreign Agricultural Policy and 
on Agricultural Production. 

They are hearing testimony on 
legislation to reform the coun- 
try's scandal ridden grain-in- 
spection system. 

Under the present system, 
grain is inspected by private 
or state agencies employing in- 
spectors licensed by the Agri- 
culture Department. Federal su- 
pervisors spotcheck, on a ran- 
dom basis, the work of the 
private and state inspectors. 

Spokesmen for the railroad 
took n position on the federal- 
izing of grain inspection and 
weighing, but they called for 
strict. Federal standards for all 
weighing and handling of grain 
as well as strict standards of 
independence and competence 
for personnel involved. 

Meanwhile, Cargill, Inc., be- 
came the first grain company 
to agree voluntarily to an “af- 
firmative action plan*' to assure 
integrity in grain inspection 
and handling. The Agriculture 
Department recently asked all 
grain companies to adopt such 
programs. 

Cargltl agreed to a plan for 
increased inspection and audits 
with regular reports to the de- 
partment I also promised re- 
ports and audits of customer 1 
complaints.
