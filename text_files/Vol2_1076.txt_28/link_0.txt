            Leading Ingredients
          
        
Paracress Extract: A medicinal floral extract proven to instantly and visibly lift and firm the skin upon application


SQUALANE: Derived from sugarcane, it mimics body's natural hydrating oils to provide weightless moisture to deliver active ingredients deep into the skin and prevent overdrying.
Pink Marine Algae: Visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around the eye area within 7 days






All Ingredients:
Water (Aqua), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Squalane, Glycerin, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Olivate, Jojoba Esters, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Panthenol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cetyl Palmitate, Spilanthes Acmella Flower Extract, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Sorbitan Palmitate, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Astaxanthin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol, Citric Acid.






1Can eye cream be used on my eyelid?

Yes, it is safe and we recommend you apply around the eye area for even better results.



2Is the packaging recyclable?

Yes, the glass jar is fully recyclable, once rinsed out. Just dispose of the inner seal disc and outer label.



3How is this different than the Peptide Eye Gel?

Marine Algae Eye Cream is a rich, yet non greasy cream that visibly lifts and tightens the delicate eye area. It is specifically addressing preventing and correcting the look of fine lines and wrinkles, while Squalane + Peptide Eye Gel is a lightweight gel formula that targets signs of fatigue including dark circles and puffiness. 



4The color is different. Did you change the formula?

No formula changes. As we don’t use synthetic colorants, the color in the eye cream comes from a natural algae extract that has that peachy hue. Depending on the lot of this particular ingredient, there can be variation in the finished product color.
