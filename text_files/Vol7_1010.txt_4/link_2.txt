Glyceryl ricinoleate
In cosmetic formulations Glyceryl ricinoleate can have the following functions: Emulsifier/co-emulsifier, refatting agent, dispersing aid. But the primary function of Glyceryl ricinoleate is a skin protection agent.
The availability of the free hydroxyl groups of Glyceryl ricinoleate is the reason for its excellent skin protection. Glyceryl ricinoleate is surface-active because of its free hydroxyl groups of mono- and diglycerides. It forms W/O-emulsions and also acts as co-emulsifier in O/W-emulsions. Glyceryl ricinoleate is well-tolerated by the skin and mucosa. Skin reactivity to aggressive substances is decreased and therefore Glyceryl ricinoleate can be readily used as a skin-protecting agent.
Glyceryl ricinoleate is attracted to the adsorption sites on the skin surface, and therefore protects it from being attacked by harmful substances.
Characteristics
The consistency of Glyceryl ricinoleate can be liquid to pasty, due to temperature conditions fractionated crystallization can occur. SOFTIGEN® 701 is a fatty, yellowish to white product with a neutral odor. At 30 – 35 °C it is a clear liquid of oily consistency having a viscosity of approx. 500 –600 mPas.
Glyceryl ricinoleate is miscible with fats and oils. It is readily soluble in ethanol, diethylether, toluole and methylene chloride. It is water dispersible. Polar binding forces (Van-der-Waals forces) come from the glyceryl hydroxyl groups and from the 12-hydroxy-9-cis-octadecanoic acid (ricinoleic acid). Because of its purely vegetable origin and manufacturing process, Glyceryl ricinoleate is free from heavy metals, catalyst residues and solvents. It is stabilized with BHT. It contains max. 0.5 % of water.
