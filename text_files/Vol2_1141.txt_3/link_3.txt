But once you're armed with a little extra information, you'll realize just how widespread and beloved this soothing ingredient is. "Vitamin E is the name given to [a] family of oil-soluble antioxidants," cosmetic chemist Ni'Kita Wilson previously explained. Out of the eight types of vitamin E, she noted that "tocopheryl acetate and tocopherol are most commonly found in skin-care products."While vitamin E may be most well-known for its moisturizing properties, it's foremost an antioxidant that guards and strengthens a weakened skin barrier, which seals essential water and electrolytes in and protects the skin against dehydration and external stressors. Vitamin E also plays an important role in relieving conditions like flakiness, peeling, roughness, and itchiness, and also lends a helping hand in improving the appearance of acne scars.You'll often find vitamin E paired with another skin-loving nutrient, vitamin C. The reason for that is because vitamin E "works synergistically with vitamin C to provide UVB protection," David Kim, MD, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York City, explains. While vitamin E alone can provide some level of protection against damage caused by free radicals, it's much more effective when combined with vitamin C, and a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology further proves this point.Because vitamin E is fat-soluble, Dr. Kim says that it's "readily absorbable in our skin, which is great for people with dry skin." However, he says that those with oily or acne-prone skin should be cautious around vitamin E, as it can potentially exacerbate breakouts. (No thanks.)Naturally occurring vitamin E can be found in other moisturizing powerhouses like argan, sunflower, almond, safflower, rice bran, and grapeseed oils, which means you probably have plentiful vitamin E already baked into your skin-care routine. But if that's not the case, worry not, because we rounded up the best vitamin E products below, as recommended by Allure editors and board-certified dermatologists.Ready to feel more confident when reading your beauty products' ingredient labels? Enter, the Allure Ingredient Index. In this comprehensive guide, you'll find everything you need to know about the most in-demand (and under-the-radar) ingredients in your favorite skin-care products.All products featured on Allure are independently selected by our editors.

(As with any vitamin C-infused product, wearing sunscreen during the daytime is of the utmost importance.)Dr. Kim is one of many dermatologists that recommend this highly effective elixir, which is spiked with a 1 percent concentration of vitamin E. "Compounding vitamin C with another antioxidant [like vitamin E] helps preserve the stability and boost the effectiveness of the serum," Michelle Henry, MD, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York City, previously explained. Both vitamin E and ferulic acid essentially make it easier for your skin to absorb the serum.Pinterest2/15KraveBeauty Beet the Sun Lightweight Sunscreen SPF 40Shop Now$20KraveBeautyAfter two years of intensive research and independent testing, KraveBeauty's Beet the Sun SPF is finally back after being discontinued in 2021. With a freshly-minted rating of SPF 40 (and new packaging), this skin-soothing formula remains a real treat for your complexion.Ingredient highlights include antioxidant beet root extract (also high in vitamin C for a radiance boost), hydrating hyaluronic acid, and of course, vitamin E to maintain a healthy barrier. "The silky, lightweight cream disappears without a trace and leaves my skin feeling dewy and fresh-faced," Allure commerce editor Sarah Han confirms.Pinterest3/15Versed Day Dissolve Cleansing BalmShop Now$18VersedWe're looking out for you when we say, "please step away from the single-use cleansing wipes." Our advice? Use a small dollop of Versed's Day Dissolve Cleansing Balm to melt away your toughest makeup without leaving your complexion looking raw and irritated.For a fully relaxing experience, take about a minute to thoroughly massage the vitamin E-infused balm into your (dry) skin — it's so satisfying to watch all of your eye makeup break down. Once it comes into contact with water, the balm transforms into a milky texture that rinses off totally clean and residue-free. And, for an extra dash of nourishment, you'll find avocado, clove leaf, eucalyptus, and jojoba oils in the formula for baby-soft skin.Pinterest4/15The Inkey List Vitamin B, C, and E MoisturizerShop Now$8The Inkey ListShop Now$8SephoraIdeal for normal skin that needs a daily dose of hydration, The Inkey List's Vitamin B, C, and E Moisturizer lays it all out in its name.

Hello dewy, but not shiny, skin.Pinterest7/15Paula's Choice C15 Super BoosterShop Now$55Paula's ChoiceShop Now$55AmazonWhile Dr. Kim notes that Paula's Choice doesn't disclose the percentage of tocopherol present in the formula, he recommends the C15 Super Booster nonetheless if you're looking for a potent vitamin C serum (15 percent) that's bolstered by both vitamin E and ferulic acid. As the name states, this antioxidant-rich booster can be used alone as its own step, or added to your favorite moisturizers and serums. The latter cocktail could also relieve any potential irritation sensitive skin may experience, which we appreciate.Pinterest8/15The Body Shop Vitamin E Eye CreamShop Now$19AmazonThe Body Shop's Vitamin E Eye Cream pumps a dream team of hyaluronic acid and vitamin E into the delicate, prone-to-creasing areas around your eyes so they stay plump and smooth throughout all of the emotions and eye strain you encounter.
