        Quali-E: effective skin production with environmentally friendly technology
    




The most widely used active ingredient in the beauty industry, Vitamin E has proven antioxidant effects, enhances moisturization and strengthens the skin barrier. Vitamin E helps to counteract the appearance of inflammation linked to oxidative processes through downregulation of its mediators. As one of the most powerful oil-soluble antioxidants and free-radical scavengers available today, Vitamin E plays a crucial role in oxidative regeneration of skin exposed to stressors. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of vitamin E manufacture has confirmed that the DSM production process generates very little GHG emissions, up to 89% less from raw materials compared to conventional building blocks and 74% less from energy generation compared to coal-based production.






















        Product Features
    





Vitamin E is available in several natural and synthetic forms for the personal care application:
The Vitamin E acetate forms, d-α-Tocopheryl Acetate and dl-α-Tocopheryl Acetate, are extremely stable in formulations and therefore the compounds of choice for cosmetic preparations with maximum vitamin efficacy. 
The tocopherol forms dl-α -Tocopherol and Mixed Tocopherols are mostly used to stabilize oxygen-sensitive ingredients in cosmetic formulations, to enhance the shelf-life of the formulation. 


















        Benefits
    





Helps to protect beautiful and healthy-looking skin. 
Helps improving skin resilience induced by damages from urban pollutants. 
Helps to enhance skin sensation by soothing. 
Helps in skin softening & improves appearance of skin with acne and blemishes. 
Significantly strengthens the skin barrier, even with rinse-off products containing α-tocopherol in concentrations of less than 0.2%.

        Mode of Action
    




The protecting effects of Vitamin E are manifold and reported in many publications. But its central role is that of a strong antioxidant, capturing free oxygen radicals generated by exposure to UV-light or pollution and preventing damages.
