But with real cream. Duh.) Well, a friend of mine asked me if she need to keep it the other day, and I realized I had no idea. I can't believe after over five years of being a beauty editor, I had not a clue as to what to tell my girl. I mean, is it a packaging formality that you can ditch (like the seal on vitamins or something)? Or should you hold on to it? Anyways, I investigated.You guys, I can't believe it: The consensus in the dermatologist world seems to be YES. You should keep it! Crazy, right?! I have always ditched 'em in the past. Whoops.Anyway, the seal helps block out light and air that can break down the active ingredients in your creams, whichever they may be. So, is it the end of the world if you tossed it? Probably not, but your stuff will last longer and be more effective if you hold on to it.
