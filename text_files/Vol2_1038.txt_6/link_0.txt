Background
Various forms of plastic are ubiquitous in our modern lives. Unfortunately discarded plastic is also a major environmental problem with non-biodegradable plastics choking waterways, polluting streets and taking up precious space in landfills. Most plastics can be sucessfully recycled. Plastic recycling is made easier by special codes put into the plastic item at the point of manufacture.
Plastic Recycling Codes
Plastic recycling codes come from the The Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc. (SPI) that introduced its resin identification coding system in 1988 after lobbying by recyclers. The recycling codes are explained below. 
Number 1 Code - Polyethylene Terephthalate, PETE

Figure 1. Symbol for PETE plastics 
Name of Plastic - Polyethylene Terephthalate, PET or PETEDescription - PET or PETE is a clear, tough plastic commonly used as single use bottled beverage containers. It is easily recycled, inexpensive, lightweight and poses a low risk of leaching breakdown byproducts into the environment. It is in high demand for remanufacturers but recyclign rates are only around 20%. Can also be used as a fibre.Recycling Method - Collected through most curbside recycling programsVirgin Plastic Uses - Soft drink, water and plastic beer bottles, pillow, quilt and sleeping bag fillings, food containers.Recycled Plastic Uses - Polar fleece, packaging film, carpets, tote bags, furniture, building materials like panelling and occasionally new containers.
Number 2 Code - High Density Polyethylene, HDPE

Figure 2. Symbol for HDPE plastics 
Name of Plastic - High Density Polyethylene, HDPEDescription - HDPE is a readily recyclable, versatile plastic commonly used for packaging. It is usually white or coloured and poses a low risk of leaching.Recycling Method - Collected through most curbside recycling programs. Some programs only allow containers with necks.Virgin Plastic Uses - Some garbage and shopping bags, milk and cream bottles, bleach, detergent and household cleaner bottles, motor oil containers, butter containers, yoghurt tubs, milk crates, rubbish bins, pipes and moulded products.Recycled Plastic Uses - Oil bottles, recycling containers, drainage pipes, floor tiles, synthetic timber, fencing, laundry detergent bottles.
Number 3 Code - Polyvinyl Chloride, PVC

Figure 3. Symbol for PVC plastics 
Name of Plastic - Polyvinyl Chloride, PVCDescription - PVC can be either a hard and rigid plastic or flexible and elastic plastic. It can be clear, white or coloured. PVC is a tough polymer and weathers well so is commonly used for siding, pipes and other building materials. PVC contains chlorine so should never be burnt as bruing will release toxic chemicals. The manufacture of PVC can release dangerous dioxins.Recycling Method - Rarely recycled. May be accepted by synthetic timber or plastic timber makers.Virgin Plastic Uses - Cleaning product and detergent bottles, shampoo bottles, food packaging, wire conduit, medical equipment, pipes and fittings, siding and hoses.Recycled Plastic Uses - Pipe and fittings, decks, panelling, truck mudflaps, drainage mats and flooring, speed bumps, mats and shoes.
Number 4 Code - Low Density Polyethylene, LDPE

 Semiconductors eBook   Compilation of the top interviews, articles, and news in the last year.   Download a free copy Figure 4. Symbol for LDPE plastics 
Name of Plastic - Low Density Polyethylene, LDPEDescription - LDPE is a soft, flexible plasticRecycling Method - LDPE is not often recycled through curbside programs. Many stores have programs that allow for plastic shopping bags to be returned to the store for recycling.Virgin Plastic Uses - Squeezable bottles, shopping bags, food bags like bread and frozen food bags, dry cleaning bags, clothing, carpet, garbage bags, black plastic sheeting, ice cream container lidsRecycled Plastic Uses - Trash can liners and cans, compost bins, shipping envelopes, paneling, lumber, landscaping ties, floor tile Film for builders, industry, packaging and plant nurseries, bags, agricultural piping
Number 5 Code - Polypropylene, PP

Figure 5. Symbol for PP plastics 
Name of Plastic - Polypropylene, PPDescription - Polypropylene is a hard, flexible plastic that has a high melting point and is suited for high temperature applications like holding hot liquidsRecycling Method - Collected through some curbside recycling programs.Virgin Plastic Uses - Ice cream containers, drinking straws, lunch boxes, potato crisp bagsRecycled Plastic Uses - Brooms, brushes, rakes, compost bins, recycling crates, plant pots, motor vehicle parts 
Number 6 Code - Polystyrene, PS

Figure 6. Symbol for PS plastics 
Name of Plastic - Polystyrene, PSDescription - Polystyrene may be either a rigid, brittle plastic or made into foam products. Evidence suggests that polystyrene can leach toxins into food.Recycling Method - Collected through some curbside recycling programs.Virgin Plastic Uses - Imitation crystal glassware, plastic cutlery, takeaway food containers, hot drink cups, meat trays, egg cartons, CD cases Recycled Plastic Uses - Insulation, packing materials, rulers, office equipment, clothes pegs, coat hangers, light switches, air conditioning vents
Number 7 Code - Other 

Figure 7. Symbol for other plastics 
Name of Plastic - All other plasticsDescription - Number 7 plastics simply icludes all other plastics. These include compostable and biodegradable plastics like polyactide through to acrylic, nylon and polycarbonate.Recycling Method - Traditionally not recycled but now being collected through some curbside recycling programs.Virgin Plastic Uses - Water bottles, CDs and DVDs, bullet-proof materials, sunglasses, telephone, MP3 player and computer cases, signs and displays, clothingRecycled Plastic Uses - Plastic timber, outdoor furniture, pipes, injection moulded products
