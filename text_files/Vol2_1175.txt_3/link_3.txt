Cetyl Alcohol
Cetyl Alcohol is a widely used, all-purpose, stabilizing emulsifier / co-emulsifier, and it is compatible with almost all common cosmetic ingredients. It is a common non-gelling thickening agent that's used throughout the cosmetic industry for its  stable consistency, and the other benefits it  gives to products. It  is comprised of 95% fatty acids derived from vegetable oils, primarily coconut and palm oils.
Cetyl Alcohol is used in formulations to make all kinds of creams, lotions, shampoos, conditioning agent , hair conditioners. In creams and lotions it improves feel and texture, while also thickening and adding body. In shampoos and conditioners it adds texture and smoothing and feel to the product, and helps with improving wet comb out. In body body washes it adds nice feel to the product while also adding body and thickening. 
In makeup products like lipsticks, and other non water based products, it adds emolliency and consistency.It is often used as an easy to use and natural thickener / rheology modifier that will improve the texture of all formula containing an oil phase. 
In addition to the more  common uses (emulsion stabilizing for example) it is also used for its excellent after feel, as an  emollient, moisturizer, viscosity stabilizer, non gelling thickening, and foam enhancer in water based products. 
Cetyl Alcohol is an excellent addition to you hair and skin care products. It is environmentally friendly, is a green product as a thickener. Plus cetyl Alcohol adds good after feel in lotions and creams, and in hair conditioners offers good comb out ability.

fabulous in lotions and shampoo bars

I use this in lotions (1-2%) and in shampoo bars (3-5%) and find it contributes a silkiness that I really like. It is easy to use, melts readily, blends nicely. I love it!
