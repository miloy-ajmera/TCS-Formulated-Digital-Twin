Great !!



This is an excellent eye cream, doesn't irritate my eyes at all it lifts and smooths out the delicate eye area. It's a thick eye cream which I like , I put a little on my ring finger and rub them together to warm it up some then lightly dab on the top and bottom occipital bone because the skin there is thin and it will spread out where it needs to be. Works very fast ! Love it.

My go-to eye cream



[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm an Estee Lauder gal and I love this eye cream! Super moisturizing without being too heavy for daywear.

Not as expected



[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this a month ago because it has peptides in it.  I use it every night anda little in the AM before putting on my under eye corrector.  Do not see a difference at all.  Will return it.  Very disappointed!!
