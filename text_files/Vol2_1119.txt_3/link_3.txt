The product is a mix of waxes and mineral oils, and is a part of many health and beauty routines.One claim currently popular on social media is that Vaseline can be used to increase your breast size and firmness. The idea is that by applying Vaseline to your breasts every day for a given period of time — usually around 30 days — you can increase your cup size.Can Vaseline help your breasts grow?There’s no clinical evidence that applying Vaseline to your breasts will increase their size or firmness. Rubbing the product on your chest each night will not cause them to grow.Can Vaseline combined with toothpaste increase breast size and firmness?Some claim that by massaging Vaseline on your breasts and rubbing toothpaste on your nipples, you can increase breast size and firmness. Just like with Vaseline, there’s no evidence toothpaste has an effect on the size and firmness of breasts.If you believe your breasts feel tighter after an application of toothpaste, it’s likely the toothpaste has dried, thus creating a tighter feeling on your skin.When you remove the toothpaste, that tight feeling will likely fade and your breasts will not have been impacted in terms of size or firmness. Toothpaste might be damaging to the delicate tissue of the nipple.Are there any risks? As long as you’re not allergic to any of the ingredients in Vaseline or the toothpaste you use, there are no risks in applying them to your breasts. If you experience sneezing, a runny or itchy nose, or a rash where the products were applied, you may be allergic and should stop application. Be aware that the ingredients of some toothpaste brands can irritate sensitive skin.How can you increase breast size? Your breast size is generally determined by genetics and body weight, thus there are limited ways to naturally increase their size. Women do often experience a change in their breast size during pregnancy or during certain times in their menstrual cycle.Breast augmentation surgery is the only proven method for increasing breast size. This relatively common surgery (which involves adding implants under your breast tissue) does include risks, including:pain in breastsbruising or bleedinginfection leaking or rupture of implantsscarringAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there’s also a connection between breast implants and an increased risk of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. If you’re considering surgically increasing your breast size, consult with your doctor to learn more about the process, expectations, costs, and risks.Takeaway There are countless claims about ways to naturally grow your breast size, including the suggestion that applying Vaseline and toothpaste to your chest each night will, after several weeks, cause growth.Though the risks to trying this natural technique are minimal, there’s no evidence that it’s effective. If you’re interested in increasing the size of your breasts, the most proven method is through breast augmentation surgery. Be aware that there are risks, side effects, and costs to consider.
