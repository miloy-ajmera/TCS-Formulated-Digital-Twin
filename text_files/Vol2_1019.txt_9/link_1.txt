  FAQ's   Why should STEP 2 creams be layered before 8-in-1 BioSerum?Together with the activity to stimulate new skin, the defensin-molecules have an extra beneficial activity to "close gaps" between cells on the surface of our skin. It means that defensins prevent water loss from the skin. The 8-in-1 BioSerum contains the highest concentration of defensins, meaning that once our bioserum is applied, penetration into the skin surface other products will be compromised (if "nothing/water goes out" - then "nothing is goes in").
This is a unique property of defensin molecules, therefore we always advise layering the 8-in-1 BioSerum as the last step of the skincare regimen, only sunscreen and makeup (if any) is recommended to be applied on top of the 8-in-1 BioSerum in the morning or nothing at night.
