                      Select the area of the website you want to search in the drop-down menu next to the search bar: Products, Formulas, Literature or Contacts.
                    
The 'SDS' option allows you to directly find an SDS for a product listed on the website.

                      Enter one or several keywords: they can be trade names, INCI names, formula names,
                      events at which Kobo presented a paper, names or departments for contacts.
                    

                      If several keywords are entered, the results will be of Products, Formulas, Literature
                      or Contacts that have all keywords together (AND search). If no results are found
                      with all keywords, the search will present results with either of the keywords (OR
                      search).
                    

                      Result tables can be sorted by clicking titles in the headers: click once for sorting
                      by ascending order, twice for descending order. All columns can be sorted, including
                      territories.
                    

                    Depending on area searched, links in the result tables will bring you to Product
                    Description pages, or Products, Formulas, Literature or Contact pages.
