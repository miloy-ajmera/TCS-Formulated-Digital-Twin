            Pigment Blends
        

Our pigment blends are a standardized mixture of different iron oxides such as iron oxide yellow, red, brown and black and titanium dioxide. These blends are typically used in foundations and face powders. When further mixed with mica pigments and other cosmetic colors, however, these blends can also be used for making lipstick, lip gloss, eye shadow, blush and lip liner pencils. Many more shades can be created by adding titanium dioxide (for lighter  shades) or iron oxides (for darker shades), or simply by blending  the different pigment blends  with each other. When the pigment blends are used to make liquid foundation they need to be well dispersed in an emollient using a mortar and pestle. Only then the colors will develop fully. Likewise, for making powder mineral foundation the pigment blends need to be blended with the mineral fillers using the with mortar and pestle.
