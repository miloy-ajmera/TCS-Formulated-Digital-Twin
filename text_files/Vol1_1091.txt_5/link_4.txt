The hand cream for hand cream experts.
For very dry hands & nails.
A hand cream so perfect - we cloned it into 4 naturally-infused options to transform your hands and nails from dry to super soft.
With triple lanolin.
We can’t get enough of this superstar-hero-ingredient. Triple lanolin packs a moisture punch to transform even the driest hands and brittle nails to super-soft, deeply & truly hydrated hands & nails.
The molecular structure of lanolin mimics human oils, so our hand cream leaves a silky veil on your skin for continual moisture without a hint of sliminess.
To get the best results, warm the Lanolin + Rose Hand Cream between your hands and massage it into your nail beds, cuticles, and skin. This self-care ritual will leave a sily veil on skin which naturally absorbs into your skin.
Rose Oil + Shea Butter + Vitamin E.
With added Moroccan rose oil - which is a brilliant antioxidant, our Rose Hand Cream is soothing and smells gorgeous. We also added Vitamin-E and Shea Butter for a super rich, creamy skin conditioner feel.
We use just the right amount of rose oil so it smells like an actual cool grown-up in expensive high-heels way.
Use daily for all-year-round hydrated beautiful, soft hands.

This is the best hand cream I've ever used, honestly. I've been using it since it was first made available. It disappears into my skin rapidly as my hands are very dry and dehydrated. They're also very sensitive and easily irritated, so having to wash them multiple times daily with soap, as well as frequently applying sanitiser hasn't helped them during the ongoing COVID crisis. 
This hand cream has always instantly saved and soothed my skin. I've ventured off to other companies, trying other pricier, supposedly more luxurious creams, but I've always returned to Lano. 
The quality is exceptional. The  invisible barrier that this cream creates is brilliant, keeping my hands protected and hydrated. Lanolin really is a miraculous product. Lanolin is probably the best anti-ageing product/ingredient, yet so many companies don't use it thus making a huge mistake with their ingredient content.
The rose (original scent) is subtle and pleasant. I loved the lemon fragrance while it lasted. I do wish another there were another citrus scent, as vanilla, coconut, and milk & honey aren't as traditional plus they're all quite sweet (not that the scents are that overpowering, but also, sweeter ones tend to attract mosquitoes which isn't a bonus for those of us in Australia.) Another floral and/or citrus scent will always get my vote and would be greatly appreciated! 
Please, don't stop making this - it's the main product of yours that I rely on regularly. 
Thank you Lano.               S           Spiridusa        Very moisturizing, but... Very moisturizing, maybe one of the most moisturizing creams I've ever used. But the smell has nothing to do with roses. I can't identify the aroma and it's not a pleasant one either. Quite sticky after application and does not absorb quickly.               l           lorrbee        Rose + Lano Handcream Intense I love this hand cream.  I have very dry hands but I apply this before I go to sleep and do not need to reapply during the day unless it is really cold.  I have not suffered the splits in my fingers since using it.  Excellent.               J          Joy        Not a fan of the smell The cream is intense it starts with a sticky feeling but it fades away. This cream has help my hands with moisture but honestly I'm not a fan of the smell does not smell like rose, I might try another scent.               C           Chrissy Walters        Simply stunning A gorgeous hand cream, the smell is divine and so thick and moisturising.             123
