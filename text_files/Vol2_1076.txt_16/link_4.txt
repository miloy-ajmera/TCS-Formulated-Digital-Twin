Store at room temperature 15°-30°C (59° -86°F).

Uses: Helps prevent sunburn. If used as directed with other sun protection measures (see above), decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun.

Love love love!
Hands down the best tinted sunscreen I’ve ever used. It’s not oily at all and blends into the skin beautifully. I feel hydrated with enough coverage (don’t need any foundation!). It also lasts a while! Will be using this for the long haul.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



                Is HydraTint reef-friendly?
              



Yes, HydraTint does not contain reef damaging chemicals such as Octinoxate or Oxybenzone and is ‘reef-friendly’.





                Will the tint match my skin tone?
              



HydraTint was formulated with a beautiful tint to be compatible with most skin tones.





                Can I continue use after a procedure?
              



HydraTint was formulated to be used as a daily sunscreen, as well as post-procedure. Because post-procedure care can vary depending on the procedure, use as directed by your health care provider.





                Is this non-comedogenic?
              



HydraTint has gone through Comedogenicity testing to determine if the product can clog pores, which it passed – proving it does NOT clog pores.





                Can this be used on all skin types?
              



Yes, it is formulated to be used on all skin types (oily, combination, dry). If you have specific skin concerns, please consult with your health care provider.





                How long will this product last?
              



This is completely dependent upon use. If using once a day, it will last approximately 5 months.





                Is it safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding?
              



Please consult with your health care provider.
