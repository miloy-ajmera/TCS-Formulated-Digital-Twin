Abstract

Emulsion treatment compositions comprise an aqueous continuous phase and a discontinuous phase in the form of an oil-in-oil emulsion. The oil-in-oil emulsion comprises a reactive component including a reactive agent and an internal oil, wherein the internal oil solubilizes the reactive agent, and a middle oil in which the reactive component is dispersed. The middle oil is immiscible with the internal oil, does not solubilize the reactive agent, is immiscible in the aqueous continuous phase, and includes a hydrophobic particulate thickener. Methods for treating hair comprise applying the emulsion treatment compositions to hair.




Description

FIELD OF INVENTION
The present invention relates to a system for the delivery of reactive cosmetic actives (such as reactive conditioners, dyes, styling aids, sunscreens etc.) to amino acid based substrates from a chemically shelf stable formulation.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Consumers have been treating amino acid based substrates for years. Such treatments have included the waterproofing or coloring of textiles, the sunscreening of skin, the coloring, conditioning, and styling of hair, the dentifrice treatment of teeth, and more. It is well known that if such treatments can be done by a safe covalent attachment to the substrate, that the treatment will be much more long lasting. Therefore, several reactive chemistries have been developed to provide covalent attachment to amino acid based substrates such as hair. Historically, these technologies, based on covalent attachment of cosmetic actives, have primarily relied upon electrophilic (electron accepting) and nucleophilic (electron donating) reactive groups or âhooksâ. More recently, a Protected Thiols âhookâ technology for the covalent attachment of cosmetic actives to amino acid substrates has been proposed.
It is highly desirable to formulate consumer products as aqueous solutions or aqueous emulsions for a number of consumer preferred attributes, e.g., ease of rinsing, aesthetic feel, less coating of bathroom tiles, environmental concerns, etc. However, attaining such aqueous compositions is problematic in the delivery of technologies for the covalent attachment of cosmetic actives to amino acid based substrates. The reactive groups or âhookâ moieties which are reactive towards amino acid residues in hair protein are also reactive towards electron rich ingredients that are employed in the formulation of consumer products to deliver these actives, including water and even atmospheric oxygen. This leads to pre-mature decomposition of the hooks of covalent reactive compounds, referred to herein as reactive agents, over the shelf life of the product which severely or completely mitigates reactive efficacy with a substrate upon usage by the consumer.
While the prior art delivery systems have addressed some of the problems of achieving covalent attachment of cosmetic actives to amino acid based substrates, they have not addressed the problems to the extent of or in the manner of the present invention, and there is a continuing need for additional improved delivery system approaches that will enable the formulation and delivery of reactive agents to amino acid based substrates from an aqueous composition that is chemically shelf stable.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is directed to emulsion treatment compositions which comprise (a) an aqueous continuous phase; and (b) a discontinuous phase in the form of an oil-in-oil emulsion which comprises (i) a reactive component including a reactive agent and an internal oil, wherein the internal oil solubilizes the reactive agent, and (ii) a middle oil in which the reactive component is dispersed, wherein the middle oil is immiscible with the internal oil, does not solubilize the reactive agent, is immiscible in the aqueous continuous phase, and includes a hydrophobic particulate thickener.
The present invention is further directed to emulsion treatment compositions which comprise (a) from about 50% to about 85%, by weight of the emulsion treatment composition, of an aqueous continuous phase; and (b) from about 10% to about 50%, by weight of the emulsion treatment composition, of a discontinuous phase in the form of an oil-in-oil emulsion which comprises (i) a reactive component including from about 1% to about 5%, by weight of the emulsion treatment composition, of a reactive agent and from about 25% to about 60%, by weight of the oil-in-oil emulsion, of an internal oil, wherein the internal oil solubilizes the reactive agent, and (ii) from about 40% to about 60%, by weight of the oil-in-oil emulsion, of a middle oil in which the reactive component is dispersed, wherein the middle oil is immiscible with the internal oil, does not solubilize the reactive agent, is immiscible in the aqueous continuous phase, and comprises from about 5% to about 15%, by weight of the middle oil, of a hydrophobic particulate thickener.
The present invention is further directed to methods for treating hair by applying an effective amount of such compositions to hair.
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
While the specification concludes with claims, which particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.
The present invention relates to the delivery of reactive agents via multiple emulsions for use in chemically shelf stable products.
The term âamino acid based substratesâ, as used herein, refers to proteinaceous materials, such as keratin, as found in human and animal hair, skin, and nails. Amino acid based substrates useful herein are hydroxyl-containing, amine-containing, thiol-containing, and disulfide-containing amino acids.
The term âcovalently reactiveâ, as used herein, refers to the ability of reactive agents to form covalent bonds with functional groups within proteinaceous keratin, e.g., with keratin amino acids comprising âSH, âOH, âNH2 or âSâSâ groups, thereby forming a permanent bond with the keratin that is resistant to shampooing or cleansing.
The term âwater immiscible solventâ, as used herein, refers to solvents which cannot be uniformly mixed or blended with water or a separate aqueous phase.
The term âreactive agentâ, as used herein, refers to compounds that comprise a reactive group or âhookâ that is covalently reactive with amino acid based substrates and a monovalent or multivalent cosmetically active functional group that imparts one or more visual, tactile or other cosmetic beneficial effects on proteinaceous materials such as keratin, hair, skin, animal fur or wool.
The term âchemically shelf stableâ or âchemically stableâ, as used herein, applies to a composition comprising a reactive agent wherein the reactive agent does not chemically decompose substantially (via hydrolysis, reduction or oxidation) over the desired shelf life of the product such that the reactive agent maintains its ability to react with the proteinaceous substrate.
The treatment compositions of the present invention can comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, or limitations described herein.
All cited references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention.
All percentages, parts and ratios are by weight of the total composition, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the specific ingredient level and, therefore, do not include solvents, carriers, by-products, filler or other minor ingredients that may be included in commercially available materials, unless otherwise specified.
Multiple emulsions are composed of droplets of one liquid dispersed in larger droplets of a second liquid which are in turn dispersed in a final continuous phase. In addition, emulsions typically consist of a continuous phase and a discontinuous phase. For example, in an oil-in-oil-in-water (O/OW) multiple emulsion, the oil-in-oil emulsion is the discontinuous phase and the water phase is the continuous phase.
For an O/O/W system, in which the external continuous phase is aqueous, the primary emulsion is an oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2), which is then emulsified into the external aqueous phase. For the purposes of clarity, and in accordance with recognized standards of nomenclature, the external aqueous phase is designated as (W), and the primary oil-in-oil emulsion is designated as (O1/O2). The primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2) includes an internal oil phase which is designated as (O1) contained within a middle oil phase which is designated as (O2). After the primary emulsion (O1/O2) has been further dispersed in the external aqueous phase (W), the complete multiple emulsion system is designated as (O1/O2/W).
A primary advantage of the present invention is the provision of a delivery system approach that will enable the formulation and delivery of reactive agents to amino acid based substrates from an aqueous composition that is chemically shelf stable. This is accomplished via an oil-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsion delivery system (O1/O2/W), wherein the reactive agent is solubilized within a suitable (O1) oil and then the (O1) phase comprising the reactive agent is emulsified within a suitable (O2) oil to form a primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2). The resulting oil-in-oil emulsion is then emulsified within the aqueous continuous phase (W) to form a multiple emulsion (O1/O2/W), which confers improved chemical shelf stability to the reactive agent. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the (O2) phase provides a barrier between the (O1) phase and the aqueous continuous phase in order to minimize contact between the chemically unstable reactive agent and the aqueous continuous phase.
In its simplest form, the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention include (a) an aqueous continuous phase; and (b) a discontinuous phase in the form of an oil-in-oil emulsion which comprises (i) a reactive component including a reactive agent and an internal oil, wherein the internal oil solubilizes the reactive agent, and (ii) a middle oil in which the reactive component is dispersed, wherein the middle oil is immiscible with the internal oil, does not solubilize the reactive agent, is immiscible in the aqueous continuous phase, and includes a hydrophobic particulate thickener.
The oil-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention typically comprise the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2) in an amount which provides the desired shelf stability. In one embodiment, the oil-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsion treatment compositions comprise the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2) in an amount of from about 1% to about 60%, more preferably from about 5% to about 55%, and more preferably still from about 10% to about 50%, based on the weight of the oil-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsion composition.
Discontinuous PhaseâPrimary Oil-in-Oil Emulsion (O1/O2).
The discontinuous phase of the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention includes a reactive component including a reactive agent and an internal oil, and a middle oil in which the reactive component is dispersed and which also comprises a hydrophobic particulate thickener.

The emulsion treatment compositions typically comprise the reactive agent in an amount of from about 0.01% to about 10%, more specifically from about 0.5% to about 8%, and more specifically still from about 1% to about 5%, based on the weight of the emulsion treatment composition (O1/O2/W).
(O1) Phase
The discontinuous phase of the oil-in-oil emulsion employed in the treatment compositions of the present invention also comprises an oil (O1). The oil (O1) helps to solubilize or disperse the reactive agents described hereinbefore. While it is recognized that some components of the composition may be dispersed rather than solubilized in the discontinuous phase, the nomenclature (O1) is employed to describe this component herein. The oil (O1) may comprise either an oil or solvent (both polar and non-polar) provided that the selected reactive agent is sufficiently soluble/dispersible in the selected oil or solvent. Suitable non-polar oils/solvents have a solubility parameter ranging from about 5.5 (cal/cm3)0.5 to about 8.0 (cal/cm3)0.5. Suitable polar oils/solvents have a solubility parameter ranging from about 8.9 (cal/cm3)0.5 to about 15.0 (cal/cm3)0.5. Solubility parameters for the (O1) phase, and means for determining such parameters, are well known in the chemical arts. More specifically, as used herein, the solubility parameter refers to the Vaughan Solubility Parameter (VSP) (â¡) which is a calculated parameter used to define a material's solubility and is defined as the sum of all the cohesive forces and the square root of the energy of vaporization. The VSP typically has a range of 5-25. A further description of solubility parameters and means for determining them are described by C. D. Vaughan, âSolubility Effects in Product, Package, Penetration and Preservationâ 103 Cosmetics and Toiletries 47-69, October 1988; and C. D. Vaughn, âUsing Solubility Parameters in Cosmetics Formulationâ, 36 J. Soc. Cosmetic Chemists 319-333, September/October, 1988.

Oil Phase (O2)
The discontinuous phase of the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention include an oil phase (O2) which emulsifies or disperses the reactive component to create the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2). It is believed that the oil phase (O2) serves as a barrier between the (O1) phase and the aqueous continuous phase to minimize contact between the chemically unstable reactive agent and the aqueous continuous phase. The barrier also serves to prevent the premature degradation of the reactive agent over the shelf life of the composition to enable the delivery of the reactive agent to the amino acid based substrate, i.e., hair, in a consumer preferable medium, i.e., an aqueous emulsion cream.
Oil Phase (O2) Oils
Preferred (O2) oils suitable for use in the present invention include those oils that are immiscible with the (O1) phase, do not solubilize the reactive agent, and are immiscible in the aqueous continuous phase (W). Preferably, the oil phase (O2) has a solubility parameter ranging from about 6.0 (cal/cm3)0.5 to about 9.0 (cal/cm3)0.5.
Suitable oils for the oil phase (O2) of the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to fatty acid derivatives, di- and tri- glycerides, vegetable oils, vegetable oil derivatives, and liquid nondigestible oils as those described in U.S. Pat.

Exemplary di- and tri-glyceride oils include castor oil, soybean oil, derivatized soybean oils such as maleated soy bean oil, safflower oil, cotton seed oil, corn oil, walnut oil, peanut oil, olive oil, cod liver oil, almond oil, avocado oil, palm oil, sesame seed oil, vegetable oils and vegetable oil derivatives, coconut oil and derivatized coconut oil, cottonseed oil and derivatized cottonseed oil, jojoba oil, cocoa butter, and mixtures thereof.
Liquid nondigestible oils include polyol polyesters such as sucrose polyesters, for example cottonseed sucrose octaesters, and solid polyol polyesters include sucrose octaesters prepared from C22 fatty acids. Specific examples of liquid nondigestible oils include a mixture of esters of behenic acid and sucrose available commercially as SEFA Behenate from The Procter & Gamble Company Cincinnati, Ohio, and a mixture of esters of cottonseed acid and sucrose available commercially as SEFA Soyate/Cottonate from The Procter & Gamble Company Cincinnati, Ohio.
Ester oils include those comprising an aliphatic alcohol hating about eight to about twenty carbon atoms, and an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid including from two to about twelve carbon atoms, or conversely, an aliphatic alcohol having two to about twelve carbon atoms with an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid including about eight to about twenty carbon atoms. The ester is either straight-chained or branched. Preferably, the ester has a molecular weight of less than about 500. Nonlimiting examples of suitable esters include, but are not limited to, a) aliphatic monohydric alcohol esters, including, but not limited to, myristyl propionate, isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl acetate, cetyl propionate, cetyl stearate, isodecyl neopentonoate, cetyl octanoate, and isocetyl stearate; b) aliphatic di- and tri-esters of polycarboxylic acids, including, but not limited to, diisopropyl adipate, diisostearyl fumarate, dioctyl adipate, and triisostearyl citrate; c) aliphatic polyhydric alcohol esters, including, but not limited to, propylene glycol dipelargonate; and d) aliphatic esters of aromatic acids, including, but not limited to C12-C15 alcohol esters of benzoic acid, octyl salicylate, sucrose benzoate, and dioctyl phthalate. Additional esters are listed in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook, Vol. 2, Eight Ed., The Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Assn., Inc., Washington, D.C. (2000) at pages 1670 through 1676, incorporated herein by reference.
The acetoglyceride esters include acetylated monoglcyerides and the lanolin and its derivatives include lanolin, lanolin oil, lanolin wax, lanolin alcohols, lanolin fatty acids, isopropyl lanolate, acetylated lanolin, acetylated lanolin alcohols, lanolin alcohol linoleate, and lanolin alcohol riconoleate.

The emulsion treatment compositions typically comprise the oil phase (O2) in an amount of from about 1% to about 95%, more preferably from about 25% to about 80%, and more preferably still from about 40% to about 60%, based on the weight of the primary oil-in-oil emulsion.
Oil Phase (O2) Particulate Thickener
The oil phase (O2) of the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention also includes a particulate thickener. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the addition of a particulate thickener to the oil phase (O2) serves as a further barrier between the reactive agent and the aqueous continuous phase and also serves to prevent coalescence of the (O1) phase. It is further believed that the particulate thickener functions to impart a yield point to the (O2) oil which mitigates Brownian movement within the oil phase (O2). It is also believed that the steric stabilization afforded by the particulate thickener coupled with the resulting higher viscosity acts to prevent coalescence of the (O1) phase, thereby imparting phase stability to the primary emulsion (O1/O2).
Preferred particulate thickeners suitable for use in the present invention include those thickeners that are immiscible in the aqueous continuous phase (W) and can take the form of a wax, hydrophobic silica, hydrophobic clay or mixtures thereof.
In one embodiment of the present invention, the particulate thickener can comprise a crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizer. The crystalline, hydroxy-containing stabilizer is selected from the group consisting of: 
        
    wherein R1 is 
        
 R2 is R1 or H, R3 is R1 or H, R4 is a single bond or C1-20 alkyl, R5 is a single bond or C1-20 alkyl, R6 is H or C1-20 alkyl, and R4+R5+R6=C1-22, and wherein 1â¦x+yâ¦4; 
        
 wherein R7 is âR4(CHOH)xR5(CHOH)yR6, wherein R4, R5, R6, x and y are as defined above; and M is Na+, K+, Mg++, or H; and iii) mixtures thereof.   
Some preferred hydroxyl-containing stabilizers include 12-hydroxystearic acid, 9,10-dihydroxystearic acid, tri-9,10-dihydroxystearin and tri-12-hydroxystearin (hydrogenated castor oil is mostly tri-12-hydroxystearin). Tri-12-hydroxystearin is most preferred for use in the emulsion compositions herein. Tri-12-hydroxystearin is available commercially as Thixcin RÂ® from Rheox and as FlowtoneÂ® from Southern Clay Products.
In another embodiment of the present invention, the particulate thickener can comprise hydrophobically modified dispersed amorphous silica. As used herein the term âdispersed amorphous silicaâ refers to small, finely divided non-crystalline silica having a mean agglomerate particle size of less than about 100 microns.
Fumed silica, which is also known as arced silica, is produced by the vapor phase hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride in a hydrogen oxygen flame. It is believed that the combustion process creates silicone dioxide molecules which condense to form particles. The particles collide, attach and sinter together. The result of this process is a three-dimensional branched chain aggregate. Once the aggregate cools below the fusion point of silica, which is about 1710â¡C., further collisions result in mechanical entanglement of the chains to form agglomerates. Precipitated silicas and silica gels are generally made in aqueous solution. See, Cabot Technical Data Pamphlet TD-100 entitled âCAB-O-SILÂ® Untreated Fumed Silica Properties and Functionsâ, October 1993, and Cabot Technical Data Pamphlet TD-104 entitled âCAB-O-SILÂ® Fumed Silica in Cosmetic and Personal Care Productsâ, March 1992, both of which are herein incorporated herein by reference.
The fumed silica preferably has a mean agglomerate particle size ranging from about 0.1 microns to about 100 microns, more preferably from about 1 micron to about 50 microns, and more preferably still from about 10 microns to about 30 microns. The agglomerates are composed of aggregates which have a mean particle size ranging from about 0.01 microns to about 15 microns, preferably from about 0.05 microns to about 10 microns, more preferably from about 0.1 microns to about 5 microns and more preferably still from about 0.2 microns to about 0.3 microns. The silica preferably has a surface area greater than 50 sq. m/gram, more preferably greater than about 130 sq. m./gram, and more preferably still greater than about 180 sq. m./gram.
The fumed silica is hydrophobically modified via the addition of non-polar moieties to the surface of the silica. Exemplary hydrophobically modified fumed silicas for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, silica dimethyl silylate whereby the fumed silica's surface has been modified with dimethyl silyl groups available commercially as Aerosil R972 and Aerosil R974 both available from Degussa; and CAB-O-SIL TS-610 and CAB-O-SIL TS-720 both available from Cabot; and silica silylate whereby the fumed silica's surface has been modified with trimethylsiloxyl groups available commercially as Aerosil R812 and Sipernat D17 both available from Degussa; and CAB-O-SIL TS-530 available from Cabot.
In another embodiment of the present invention, the particulate thickener can comprise hydrophobically modified dispersed smectite clay selected from the group consisting of bentonite, hectorite and mixtures thereof. Bentonite is a colloidal aluminum clay sulfate. See Merck Index, Eleventh Edition, 1989, entry 1062, p. 164. Hectorite is a clay containing sodium, magnesium, lithium, silicon, oxygen, hydrogen and fluorine. See Merck Index, Eleventh Edition, 1989, entry 4538, p. 729.
Hyrophobically modified dispersed smectite clays are called organoclays and are formed by reacting monoquaternary compounds with the smectite clays to form an organoclay complex. Non-limiting examples of organoclays for use in the present invention include dihydrogenated tallow benzylmonium hectorite available commercially as Bentone SD-3 from Rheox; quaternium-18 hectorite available commercially as Bentone 38 and in mixtures M-P-A 14, Bentone Gel DOA, Bentone Gel ECO 5, Bentone Gel EUG, Bentone Gel IPP, Bentone Gel ISD, Bentone Gel MIO, Bentone Gel MIO-A40, Bentone Gel SS-71, Bentone Gel 10ST, Bentone Gel VS-5, Bentone Gel VS-8, Bentone Gel VS-38, Bentone Gel VS-5PC, and Bentone Gel YVS all available from Rheox; quaternium-18 bentonite available commercially as Bentone 34 from Rheox and Claytone 40 and Claytone SO from Southern Clay; quaternium-18/benzalkonium bentonite available commercially as Claytone HT from Southern Clay; stearalkonium bentonite available commercially as Claytone AF from Southern Clay, Toxogel LG and Tixogel VZ from United Catalysts, and Viscogel B7 from Bentec; and stearalkonium hectorite available commercially as Bentone 27 from Rheox and in mixtures Bentone Gel CAO, Bentone Gel IPM, Bentone Gel LOI, Bentone Gel M-20, Bentone Gel RSS, Bentone Gel SIL, and Bentone Gel TN, all from Rheox.
The emulsion treatment compositions typically comprise the particulate thickeners in an amount of from about 1% to about 30%, more preferably from about 3% to about 20%, and more preferably still from about 5% to about 15%, based on the weight of the oil phase (O2).
Primary Emulsion (O1/O2) Emulsifier (e1)
The hereinbefore described primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2) of the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention may further comprise an optional surface active emulsifier (e1) to facilitate the formation of the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2). More particularly, the emulsifier (e1) is comprised of two parts, (A) and (B), where (A) is soluble in (O1) and (B) is soluble in (O2). Such an optional emulsifier (e1) can take the form of either a polymeric surfactant or an amphiphilic surfactant. Polymeric surfactants suitable for use herein take the form of a block copolymer, e.g. A-B-A or B-A-B or A-(B-A)n-B-A or B-(A-B)n-A-B, or a graft polymer with pendant side chains, e.g., A-(A)m-(A(B))n-A or B-(B)m-(B(A))n-B, where m is 0 to 1000 and n is 1 to 1000. Amphiphilic surfactants suitable for use herein take the form of A-B that preferably adsorbs at the (O1/O2) interface.
The choice of (A) depends on (O1). For example, if (O1) is a hydrocarbon, then (A) can be an alkyl, branched alkyl, alkenyl, or branched alkenyl moiety with 3 to 30 carbons; if (O1) is a dimethicone or silicone, then (A) can be a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) moiety with between 4 to 500 PDMS units; and if (O1) is an oxygenated solvent such as ethylene glycol, then (A) can be a polyalkylene oxide moiety, i.e., polyoxyethylene. Similarly, the choice of (B) depends on the type of (O2) oil. For example, if (O2) is a triglyceride, then (B) can be a polyalkylene oxide moiety, i.e., polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, and polybutylene oxide, with 1 to 100 alkylene oxide units. Similarly, if (O2) is a sucrose polyester, then (B) can be a polysaccharide moiety. These are exemplary embodiments only, and one skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous other combinations of oils suitable for use in the present invention.
Optional emulsifier (e1) for use in combination with the primary emulsion (O1/O2) defined herein includes any combination of (A)'s and (B)'s in either the polymeric surfactant or the amphiphilic surfactant form wherein (A) and/or (B) can comprise, but are not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, branched alkyl, branched alkenyl, polydimethylsiloxane, alkylene oxide, cellulosic, polysaccharide, polyacrylate, or polystyrene.

When an optional emulsifier (e1) is used in the primary emulsion herein, it is typically included in an amount of from about 0% to about 20%, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 15%, and more preferably still from about 0.1% to about 12%, based on the weight of the primary oil-in-oil emulsion.
External Aqueous Continuous Phase
The external aqueous continuous phase (W) of the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention comprises water as a primary ingredient. Aqueous organic solvents may also be included, provided that they do not destabilize the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2). The total concentration of the external aqueous continuous phase (W) in the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention ranges from about 40% to about 99%, more preferably from about 45% to about 90%, and more preferably still from about 50% to about 85%, based on the weight of the emulsion treatment compositions.
The continuous phase of the emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention may further comprise an emulsifier (e2) to facilitate the formation of the multiple emulsion (O1/O2/W). Emulsifiers (e2) for use in the external aqueous continuous phase of the present emulsion treatment compositions may include an anionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, amphoteric surfactant, water-soluble polymeric surfactant, water-soluble silicone-containing surfactant, nonionic surfactant having an HLB of greater than about 10, or a surfactant system capable of forming stabilizing liquid crystals around the O1/O2 droplets. The nonionic surfactant preferably has an HLB of at least 12, and more preferably, an HLB value of at least about 15.
The HLB value, or hydrophilic-lipophilic-balance value, of a surfactant is a well known term to those skilled in the art. The HLB value is related to the solubility of the surfactant, wherein a surfactant with a low HLB value, e.g., about 10 or less, tends to be oil soluble and a surfactant with a high HLB value, e.g., greater than about 10, tends to be water soluble.
The emulsifier for the external phase does not gel the external aqueous phase. The emulsifier however may be capable of forming a stabilizing layer of lamellar liquid crystals around droplets of the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2). This barrier film prevents coalescence between primary emulsion droplets and assists to preclude migration of the reactive component from the primary emulsion to the external aqueous phase.
The emulsifier included in the external aqueous phase has a low affinity for the oil phase. The emulsifier therefore does not disrupt the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2) and avoids the formation of a simple oil-in-water emulsion.
Exemplary nonionic surfactants having an HLB value of greater than about 10 include, but are not limited to, trideceth-6, ceteth-10, laureth-9, octoxynol-9, nonoxynol-12, a poloxamer, trideceth-12, oleth-20 and polysorbate-20. Numerous other nonionic surfactants having an HLB value of greater than about 10 are listed in McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents, North American and International Editions, MC Publishing Co., Glen Rock N.J., pages 235-246 (1993).
Exemplary cationic surfactants include, but are not limited to, lauryl dimethyl amine oxide, stearyl dimethyl amine oxide, cocoamidopropyl dimethylamine oxide, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, C14-20 isoalkylamidopropylethyldimonium ethosulfate, C18-22 isoalkylamidopropylethyldimonium ethosulfate, cocamidopropyldimonium hydroxypropylamino hydrolyzed animal protein, hydroxyanthraquinoneaminopropyl methyl morpholinium methosulfate, oleamidopropyl ethyldimonium ethosulfate, rapeseedamidopropyl benzyldimonium chloride, rapeseedamidopropyl ethyldimonium ethosulfate, ricinoleamidopropyl ethyldimonium ethosulfate, soyamidopropyl benzyldimonium chloride, soyamidopropyl ethyldimonium ethosulfate, stearamidopropalkonium chloride, stearamidopropyl cetearyl dimonium tosylate, and mixtures thereof.
Exemplary anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, compounds having a hydrophobic moiety, such as a carbon chain including from about eight carbon atoms to about 30 carbon atoms, and particularly from about twelve carbon atoms to about twenty carbon atoms; and further includes a hydrophilic moiety, such as sulfate, sulfonate, carbonate, phosphate or carboxylate. Often, the hydrophobic carbon chain is etherified, such as with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.
Suitable anionic surfactants include compounds in the classes known as alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkylamide sulfates, alkylaminde ether sulfates, alkyl ether sulfonates, alkylamide sulfonates, sulfate esters of an alkyl carbonates, alkyl ether carboxylates, fatty acids, soaps, alkyl sulfosuccinates, alkyl ether sulfosuccinates, alkylamide sulfosuccinates, sarcosinates, alkyl phosphates, octoxynol or nonoxynol phosphates, taurates, fatty taurides, sulfated monoglycerides, fatty acid amido polyoxyethylene sulfates, isethionates, and mixtures thereof.
Usually, the anionic surfactant is present in the composition as a neutralized salt in the form of a sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, alkylammonium or hydroxyalkylammonium salt, wherein the alkyl moiety includes from one to about three carbon atoms. The alkyl sulfates and alkyl ether sulfates are particularly effective classes of anionic surfactants. Consequently, exemplary anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, the ammonium, monoethanolmine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, isopropylamine, sodium, potassium, lithium or magnesium salt of lauryl sulfate, dodecylbenzenesulfonate, lauryl sulfosuccinate, lauryl ether sulfate, lauryl ether carboxylate, lauryl sarcosinate, cocomethyl tauride, sulfosuccinate half ester amide, and mixtures thereof. Examples of especially useful anionic surfactants are a lauryl sulfate salt and a lauryl ether sulfate salt.
Exemplary amphoteric surfactants include, but are not limited to, cocoamidopropyl dimethyl betaine, cocoamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, cocodimethyl betaine, coco imidazoline dicarboxylate, coco imidazoline monocarboxylate, cocobetaine, lapyrium chloride, lauryl sultaine, decyl betaine, oleamidopropyl betaine, tallowamidopropyl betaine, sodium caproamphacetate, sodium lauroamphoacetate, sodium cocamphopropylsulfonate, numerous other alkylamido alkylamines and betaines listed in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook, 1st Ed., 1988 at pages 9, 10, 15 and 16.
Many additional nonionic, cationic, anionic, and amphoteric surfactants are listed in McCUTCHEON'S EMULSIFIERS AND DETERGENTS, 1993 ANNUAL, published by McCutcheon Division, MC Publication Co., Glen Rock, N.J., and in the CTFA Handbook.  
In addition, a surfactant system capable of forming a liquid crystal structure also can be used as the emulsifier in the external aqueous phase (W). The surfactant system can be a single surfactant or a blend of surfactants. In some cases, a particular surfactant cannot form a liquid crystal structure alone, but can participate in the formation of liquid crystals in the presence of a second surfactant. Such a surfactant system forms a layer of lamellar liquid crystals around the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2) to provide a barrier between the primary emulsion and the external aqueous phase. This type of an emulsion is different from the conventional emulsions which rely upon the orientation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of a surfactant at an oil-water interface. The formation of a layer of lamellar liquid crystals around the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2) can be detected by the presence of Maltese crosses viewed by optical microscopy through crossed polarizing plates or by freeze fracture electron microscopy.
As previously described, the HLB value of a surfactant is an approximate measurement of the solubility of a surfactant in water or oil. However, an HLB value is used only when the concentration of a surfactant in solution is sufficiently low such that a molecular monolayer of the surfactant is formed around droplets dispersed in a continuous phase, i.e., around the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2). At higher surfactant concentrations, the surfactant can undergo a phase transition and the oil droplets then can be surrounded by a layer of lamellar liquid crystals, which can improve emulsion stability. The liquid crystals are localized at the oil/water interface and have been observed by microscopy techniques.
Exemplary classes of surfactants capable of participating in the formation of a liquid crystal structure around the primary oil droplets to stabilize the water-in-oil emulsion composition include, but are not limited to specific cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, quaternary ammonium surfactants and lipid surfactants.
Specific nonionic surfactants are fatty alcohols or fatty acids, or derivatives thereof, or a mixture of any of these, having a chain length of from about 14 to about 20 carbon atoms. These materials may be predominantly linear or may be branched. Some examples include myristyl alcohol, myristic acid, cetyl alcohol, palmitic acid, cestearyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, oleic acid, oleyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol, arachidic acid, and mixtures thereof.
Other specific non-ionic surfactants include condensation products of aliphatic (C16 to C22) primary or secondary linear or branched chain alcohols or phenols with alkylene oxides, usually ethylene oxide, and generally having from 1 to 30 ethylene oxide groups. Some examples include, but are not limited to, ceteth-1, ceteth-2, ceteth-3, ceteth-4, ceteth-5, ceteth-6, ceteth-10, ceteth-12, ceteth-14, ceteth-15, ceteth-16, ceteth-20, ceteth-24, ceteth-25, ceteth-30, ceteareth-2, ceteareth-3, ceteareth-4, ceteareth-5, ceteareth-6, ceteareth-7, ceteareth-8, ceteareth-9, ceteareth-10, ceteareth-11, ceteareth-12, ceteareth-13, ceteareth-14, ceteareth-15, ceteareth-16, ceteareth-17, ceteareth-18, ceteareth-20, ceteareth-22, ceteareth-23, ceteareth-24, ceteareth-25, ceteareth-27, ceteareth-28, ceteareth-29, ceteareth-30, steareth-2, steareth-3, steareth-4, steareth-5, steareth-6, steareth-7, steareth-8, steareth-10, steareth-11, steareth-13, steareth-14, steareth-15, steareth-16, steareth-20, steareth-21, steareth-25, steareth-27, steareth-30, arachideth-20, beheneth-5, beheneth-10, beheneth-20, beheneth-25, beheneth-30 and mixtures thereof.

EXAMPLES
The following examples further describe and demonstrate various embodiments within the scope of the present invention. The examples are given solely for the purpose of illustration, and are not to be construed as limitations of the present invention since many variations thereof are possible without departing from its spirit and scope. In the examples and throughout the present specification, parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Ingredients are identified by chemical or CTFA name, or otherwise defined below.
The oil-in-oil-in-water (O1/O2/W) multiple emulsion treatment compositions of the present invention typically are prepared by a two step process. First, the reactive agent is solubilized within a suitable (O1) oil/solvent and then the (O1) oil/solvent comprising the reactive agent is emulsified within a suitable oil (O2) to form the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2). In preparing the primary oil-in-oil emulsion (O1/O2), the (O2) phase particulate thickener with optional emulsifier (e1), is first added to the (O2) oil with high shear and heat as described below. The (O1) oil/solvent is then dispersed within the (O2) oil phase under high shear conditions and preferably a high shear mixer (e.g., an IKA Ultra Turrax mixer, available from IKA Laboratories, Cincinnati, Ohio) until the (O1) droplet particle size is between about 0.1 to about 10 microns in diameter.
Next, the resulting oil-in-oil emulsion is emulsified within the aqueous continuous phase (W) to form the multiple emulsion (O1/O2/W). The primary oil-in-oil emulsion is dispersed within the aqueous continuous phase using low shear mixing (e.g., less than 500 rpm on a bench scale mixer). Intensive, high shear mixing is avoided during this manufacturing step as it has a tendency to destroy the primary emulsion and release the contents of the internal (O1) phase.
In the following Examples I-VI, the external aqueous continuous phase (W) is a fatty alcohol cream base having the following formula:
         External Aqueous Continuous Phase (W)     Ingredient Weight % of (W)         Ceteareth 25 (1) 1.50   Cetyl Alcohol (2) 2.25   Stearyl Alcohol (3) 2.25   Sodium Benzoate (4) 0.09   Phenoxyethanol (5) 0.11   Deionized water 93.8       (1) available as Volpo CS25 from Croda Oleochemicals, North Humberside, England.

(4) available as Lactil from Goldschmidt, Hopewell, Virginia.    (5) available as Phenoxetol from Clariant Corp., Charlotte, North Carolina.      
The external aqueous continuous phase is prepared according to the following procedure. In a suitable vessel, the deionized water is heated to about 80Â° C. while mixing. Next, the sodium benzoate, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and ceteareth 25 are added to the heated water. The resulting mixture is stirred at high speed (i.e., about 500 rpm on a lab scale mixer) while maintaining the temperature at approximately 80Â° C. After all of the ingredients are dispersed, mixing is continued for 30 minutes at approximately 80Â° C. Then the mixture is cooled to ambient temperature while mixing at a lower rpm.
