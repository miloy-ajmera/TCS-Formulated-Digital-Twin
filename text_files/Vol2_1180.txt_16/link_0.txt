AnnonaSense CLR™


AnnonaSense CLR™ provides the skin with means to establish a sustainable homeostatic balance, improving skin health and well-being. The potent adaptogenic action of AnnonaSense CLR™ supports the skin’s endocannabinoid system by activating the CB2 receptor. Through this action, it reduces inflammatory processes induced by TRPV1. Histamine-, as well as TNFα/Substance P-induced stress is down-regulated and the expression of a vital detrimental receptor in skin, IL-31RA, is decreased. AnnonaSense CLR™ makes the skin less sensitive and more balanced, even itch is perceivably reduced. Skin appearance is improved and the perception of well-being and quality of life is enhanced.
AnnonaSense CLR™ is obtained from Annona cherimola, common name Cherimoya, an edible fruit originating from South America.
