<strong>Spreading</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Semisolid</strong> <strong>Formulations</strong> An Update Alka Garg, Deepika Aggarwal, Sanjay Garg, and Anil K. Singla* A considerable problem associated with the manufacture <strong>of</strong> topically applied pharmaceutical products is the establishment <strong>of</strong> reliable techniques for their characterization. The efficacy <strong>of</strong> a topical therapy depends on the patient spreading the drug formulation in an even layer to administer a standard dose. Spreadability is therefore an important characteristic <strong>of</strong> these formulations and is responsible for correct dosage transfer to the target site, ease <strong>of</strong> application on the substrate, extrudability from the package, and most important, consumer preference. This article discusses the various aspects <strong>of</strong> spreading, including the factors affecting it, the techniques available for its assessment, and various additives and interactions that can alter the spreadability <strong>of</strong> the final formulation. IMAGE 100 Alka Garg and Deepika Aggarwal are doctoral scholars at the University Institute <strong>of</strong> <strong>Pharmaceutical</strong> Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India; Sanjay Garg, PhD, is an assistant pr<strong>of</strong>essor at the National Institute <strong>of</strong> <strong>Pharmaceutical</strong> Education and Research in Punjab, India; and Anil K. Singla, PhD, is a pr<strong>of</strong>essor and chairman at the University Institute <strong>of</strong> <strong>Pharmaceutical</strong> Sciences, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India. *To whom all correspondence should be addressed. <strong>Pharmaceutical</strong> semisolid preparations include ointments, pastes, cream emulsions, gels, and rigid foams. Their common property is the ability to cling to the application surface for a reasonable period <strong>of</strong> time before they are washed <strong>of</strong>f or worn <strong>of</strong>f. They usually serve as vehicles for topically applied drugs, as emollients, or as protective or occlusive dressings, or they may be applied to the skin and membranes such as the rectal, buccal, nasal, and vaginal mucosa, urethral membrane, external ear lining, or the cornea (1). These preparations are widely used as a means <strong>of</strong> altering the hydration state <strong>of</strong> the substrate (i.e., the skin or the mucous membrane) and for delivering the drugs (topical or systemic) by means <strong>of</strong> the topical–mucosal route. One <strong>of</strong> the serious problems associated with the formulation and manufacture <strong>of</strong> topical–mucosal preparations is the establishment <strong>of</strong> reliable techniques for their characterization, mainly because <strong>of</strong> the complexity <strong>of</strong> their physical structure (2). Consumer preference for such products depends on various properties <strong>of</strong> the preparation, collectively known as the textural pr<strong>of</strong>ile, which includes appearance, odor, extrudability (when applicable), initial sensations upon contact with the skin, spreading properties, tackiness, and residual greasiness after application (3). Ultimate acceptability and clinical efficacy <strong>of</strong> such preparations require them to possess optimal mechanical properties (ease <strong>of</strong> removal from the container, spreadability on the substrate), rheological properties (viscosity, elasticity, thixotropy, flowability), and other desired properties such as bioadhesion, desired drug release, and absorption (4). The efficacy <strong>of</strong> topical therapy depends on the patient spreading the formulation in an even layer to deliver a standard dose. The optimum consistency <strong>of</strong> such a formulation helps ensure that a suitable dose is applied or delivered to the target site. This is particularly important with formulations <strong>of</strong> potent drugs. A reduced dose would not deliver the desired effect, and an excessive dose may lead to undesirable side effects. The delivery <strong>of</strong> the correct dose <strong>of</strong> the drug depends highly on the spreadability <strong>of</strong> the formulation. Spreadability, in principle, is related to the contact angle <strong>of</strong> the drop <strong>of</strong> a liquid or a semisolid preparation on a standardized substrate and is a measure <strong>of</strong> lubricity, which is directly related to the coefficient <strong>of</strong> friction (5). Spreadability is subjectively assessed at shear rates varying from 10 2 to 10 5 s 1 . The rate <strong>of</strong> shear during spreading,  s 1 , is cal- 84 <strong>Pharmaceutical</strong> <strong>Technology</strong> SEPTEMBER 2002 www.pharmtech.comPage 2 and 3: culated using the following equatioPage 4 and 5: Fluid Z r Z Figure 1: Schematic repPage 6 and 7: a radiolabeled, fatty-based pessaryPage 8 and 9: To identify optimum bases for vaginPage 10 and 11: Phospholipids such as phosphatidylcPage 12 and 13: ing Spreadability of Suppository Ba
