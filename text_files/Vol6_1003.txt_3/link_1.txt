Abstract

Disclosed are cosmetic compositions which include hair cosmetic or styling compositions, comprising: a maleic acid copolymer; a polyamine selected from polyamino acids and aminated polysaccharides; a neutralizer; and water, wherein the polyamine is present in an amount less than 0.1% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, and methods of making and using the compositions to impart or maintain hair style.




Description

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Under high humidity conditions, hair tends to absorb moisture causing it to be less manageable, which makes it more difficult to shape and style hair even when using hair styling compositions. Frizzy hair is particularly prone to problems when exposed to higher humidity. Applying a moisture barrier on the hair is known to help to keep moisture out of the hair allowing for more efficient hair shaping and maintenance of hair shape, even in high humidity conditions. These types of haircare products that are the most commonly available on the cosmetics market are gels, mousses, and spray compositions that contain one or more polymer resins, known as fixing materials.
    Spray compositions, especially aerosols, typically contain at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). For essentially ecological reasons and governmental regulations in various countries, it is sought or even necessary to reduce the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the composition. To reduce the amount of VOC and to obtain a low-VOC aerosol device, the organic solvents, for instance ethanol and dimethyl ether, are partially replaced with water, and concomitantly, use of more water-soluble fixing resins such as maleic acid copolymers.
    By way of illustration of the forementioned haircare products, GB 1,603,321 and 1,603,323 teach treatment of hair using a combination of cationic polymers and anionic polymers derived from carboxylic acids, e.g., acrylic or methacrylic acid, and maleic anhydride. U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,898 is directed to an aqueous hairspray composition having low VOC content, and which contains in addition to a volatile silicone, a water-soluble resin, e.g., polyvinyl methacrylate/maleic anhydride copolymer, and the butyl ester thereof. U.S. Pat. No. 7,041,281 teaches personal care formulations such as hair care formulations that contain a so-called natural feel polymer that contains repeating units of a maleic anhydride alkyl half-ester or full acid, maleamic acid and maleimide. U.S. Pat. No. 7,837,983 teaches hair care compositions for mending split ends that contain a polyelectrolyte complex between a cationic polyquaternium polymer and an anionic copolymer such as a polyvinylmethyl/maleic acid copolymer, or a butyl ester thereof. WO/2011/143060 discloses compositions, including hairsprays that contain modified maleic anhydride copolymers such as including Aquaflex XL-30. WO 2012/021472 teaches hair care compositions that contain a polyacid and a polyamine.
    However even at very low to zero VOCs, problems related with moisture sensitivity of fully water-based products have been found to be problematic from the standpoints of moisture sensitivity and eco-toxicity depending on the polymer and regional regulations. These issues aside, the ability to maintain the shape of hair or to re-style the hair without reapplication of product, humidity resistance, hair strengthening and color fading remain as additional areas for improvement, particularly in connection with maleic-based polymers.
 BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   A first aspect of the present invention is directed to a cosmetic composition, comprising: a maleic acid copolymer; a polyamine selected from polyamino acids and aminated polysaccharides; a neutralizer; and water, wherein the polyamine is present in an amount less than 0.1% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. In preferred embodiments, the compositions are formulated as hair cosmetic or styling compositions. In other preferred embodiments, the compositions are free of silicones.
    A second aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of imparting or maintaining shape of hair, comprising applying to hair a cosmetic composition, comprising: a maleic acid copolymer; a polyamine selected from polyamino acids and aminated polysaccharides; a neutralizer; and water, wherein the polyamine is present in an amount less than 0.1% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.
 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
    FIGS. 1A and B are schematic diagrams that illustrate the type of inter-polymer interactions that may occur between the maleic acid copolymer and the polyamine (e.g., polylysine in FIG. 1A and chitosan in FIG. 1B).
 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Aside from being relatively non-ecotoxic, the compositions of the present invention can be easily formulated in a variety of galenic forms (e.g., hair sprays, gels, pastes, waxes, creams, mousses) in water-based or low alcohol/water solutions, to facilitate hair styling. To Applicants' unexpected surprise, notwithstanding the relatively small amounts of the polymers and particularly the polyamine that are present, when applied to the hair, the inventive compositions effectively seal the cuticle, and thus provide an advantage in terms of increased resistance to humidity (as demonstrated by curl retention, anti-frizz, etc.). Additional advantages may include increased resistance to color fading, increased strengthening of the hair fibers, and maintenance of hair style without re-application of the composition. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory of operation, and as illustrated in FIGS. 1A and B, Applicants believe that these advantages of the compositions are attributable, at least in part, to inter-polymeric interactions that occur and which serve to provide an effective seal on and protection of the individual hair fibers. Further, the inventive compositions remain stable even during storage, and exhibit no precipitation of the polymers.
    The term âcomprisingâ (and its grammatical variations) as used herein is used in the inclusive sense of âhavingâ or âincludingâ and not in the exclusive sense of âconsisting only ofâ. The terms âaâ and âtheâ as used herein are understood to encompass the plural as well as the singular.
    Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated (and not contraindicated), all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients and/or reaction conditions are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term âaboutâ which encompasses +10%.
    At least oneâ as used herein means one or more and thus includes individual components as well as mixtures/combinations thereof.
    The term âlipophilicâ means those compounds which are soluble in oils and are either completely or partially insoluble in water. In accordance with the present disclosure, the solubility of the lipophilic compounds is preferably less than 5% by weight, more preferably less than 1% by weight, even more preferably less than 0.5% by weight and better still, less than 0.1% by weight in water at 25Â° C. and at atmospheric pressure.
    The term âstableâ as used herein means that the composition does not exhibit phase separation.
    The term âsealingâ (and its grammatical variations) as used herein means to provide a protective barrier over the exterior of a keratinous substrate such as hair in order to inhibit water from penetrating into and escaping from the keratinous substrate.
    âSubstituted,â as used herein, means comprising at least one substituent. In addition to other specific substituents disclosed herein, non-limiting examples of substituents include atoms, such as oxygen atoms and nitrogen atoms, as well as functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups, ether groups, alkoxy groups, acyloxyalkyl groups, oxyalkylene groups, polyoxyalkylene groups, carboxylic acid groups, amine groups, acylamino groups, amide groups, halogen-containing groups, ester groups, thiol groups, sulphonate groups, thiosulphate groups, siloxane groups, and polysiloxane groups. The substituent(s) may be further substituted.
 Maleic Acid/Anhydride Copolymers
   For purposes of the present invention, the term âmaleic acid copolymerâ refers to and embraces copolymers of maleic acid or maleic anhydride, or a cosmetically acceptable derivative of maleic acid or maleic anhydride, and at least one additional comonomer copolymerizable therewith. Maleic acid copolymers are known in the cosmetics art, e.g., in hair care, as âfixingâ polymers or agents, which as used herein refers to a polymer that makes it possible to give or impart a shape to the hair and/or to hold or maintain the hair in a given shape.
    Representative examples of the co-monomers that are polymerizable with the maleic acid, anhydride or derivative thereof, include vinyl esters (e.g., alkyl (e.g., C1-C4) vinyl esters such as methyl vinyl esters), vinyl ethers (e.g., alkyl (e.g., C1-C4) vinyl ethers such as methyl vinyl ether and isobutyl vinyl ether), vinyl halides (e.g., alkyl (e.g., C1-C4) vinyl halides), phenylvinyl derivatives (e.g., styrene), alpha-olefins (e.g., C2-C20 olefins such as ethylene, propylene, butylene and isobutylene), cycloolefins (e.g., norbornene, 5-methylnorbornene, 5-ethylnorbornene, 5,6-dimethylnorbornene, 5,5,6-trimethylnorbornene, 5-ethylidenenorbornene, 5-phenyl-norbornene, 5-benzylnorbornene, and 5-vinylnorbornene), vinyl triazoles (e.g., 4- and 5-vinyl-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles), and (meth)acrylic acid and esters thereof.
    Thus, representative examples of maleic acid/anhydride copolymers that may be useful in the practice of the present invention include methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer (e.g., available commercially from ISP under the tradename GANTREZÂ® S (e.g., GANTREZÂ® S-97 BF; INCI:PVM/MA copolymer)), methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer (e.g., available commercially from ISP under the tradename GANTREZÂ® AN; INCI:polymethylvinylether/maleic anhydride copolymer), isobutyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer, ethylene-maleic anhydride copolymer, isobutylene-maleic anhydride copolymer, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, vinyltriazole-maleic anhydride copolymer and vinylnorbornene-maleic anhydride copolymer. The copolymers may contain, in addition to the at least one copolymerizable monomer, both maleic acid and maleic anhydride, or a derivative thereof. U.S. Pat. No. 6,562,928, for example, teaches terpolymers of maleic acid, maleic anhydride and alkylvinylethers.
    The maleic acid/anhydride monomer or repeating unit may be derivatized. For example, referring to the representative formula I:
  



 
 



  the maleic acid monomer may be partially esterified (i.e., a half-ester wherein either R1 or R2, but not both, represents an alkyl group such as ethyl, isopropyl, butyl) or totally esterified wherein each of R1 and R2 represents an alkyl group (e.g., a C1-C4 alkyl ester group). Copolymers that contain the half-ester are available commercially from ISP under the tradename GantrezÂ® ES (e.g., GantrezÂ® ES-225; INCI: ethyl ester of PVM/MA copolymer, and GantrezÂ® ES-425 and ES-425L; INCI: butyl ester of PVM/MA copolymer).
    In yet further embodiments, the carboxyl groups in the maleic acid monomer or repeating unit are converted to a metal salt such as an alkaline metal (e.g., Na) or an alkaline earth metal (e.g., Ca). That is, R1 and R2 each independently represents an alkali metal cation, or together represent an alkaline earth metal cation. Copolymers such as these are available commercially e.g., from ISP under the tradename GANTREZÂ® MS (INCI: calcium/sodium PVM/MA copolymer).
    In other embodiments, the copolymer contains a nitrogen-derivatized maleic acid and/or maleic anhydride repeating unit as represented by formula II or formula III:
  



 
 



  i.e., substituted malemic acid and substituted maleimide respectively, wherein R3 and R4 are each a derivatizing group selected from hydrophobic amines (e.g., monofunctional Î±-unsubstituted primary or secondary monoamines, unsubstituted or substituted with alkyl, aryl, heterocyclic, aromatic, fluoro, silyl, amino, carboxy and halogen, e.g., C1-C40 alkyl NH2, butylamine, isobutyl amine, and octadecylamine); hydrophilic amines (e.g., hydroxy Î±-unsubstituted amines e.g., ethanolamine, isopropylamine, n-propanolamine, 3-amino-1-propanol, methoxyethyl amine, and diglycol amine, and alkyl diamines, e.g., 3-(dimethylamino)propylamine, dimethylethylene diamine, N-aminopropyl pyrrolidone, N-aminoethyl pyrrolidone, and 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole); and polyether amines (e.g., polyoxyalkylene amine, having the formula (IV):
  



 
 



  wherein R5 and R6 are selected from H and alkyl; e.g., R5 is CH3 and R6 is H; and R5 is CH3 and R6 is CH3; and n and m are integers from 1-50; e.g., n=32 and m=10); and suitable mixtures thereof. Copolymers such as these may be available commercially from ISP under the tradename AQUAFLEXÂ® (e.g., AQUAFLEXÂ® XL-30 (isobutylene/dimethylaminopropyl maleimide/ethoxylated maleimide/maleic acid copolymer; INCI:polyimide-1; GANTREZÂ® AQUAFLEXÂ®FX-64; INCI: isobutylene/ethylmaleimide/hydroxyethylmaleimide copolymer. Methods of making these derivatized maleic acid/anhydride copolymers are known in the art and described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,886,194 and 7,041,281.
    In yet other embodiments, the maleic acid/anhydride repeating unit or copolymer is derivatized with a so-called modifying reactant moiety which may be represented the formulae: QâR7âNH2; ZâNH2; and EâOH, wherein Q is a siloxane, R7 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aryl groups, Z is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, silyl, and tertiary amine groups having the structure NR8R9, R10, quarternary amine groups having the structure +NR8R9R10R11Aâ, and polyether groups having the structure (V)
  



 
 



  wherein R8, R9, R10, and R11 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aryl groups, Aâ is an anion, q and p are integers independently ranging from about 1 to about 10,000, E is a siloxane or is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, silyl, and amino groups. Maleic acid copolymers produced using these modifying reactant moieties are described in WO 2011/143060. Such copolymers might provide various advantages to styling performance in terms of balancing properties.
    In general, the maleic acid/anhydride copolymers possess an acid number/polarity that is less than about 500 (and in some embodiments less than about 400), a refractive index greater than about 1.475, a modulus Eâ² of from about 0.1 to about 10 GPa (T<Tg), and from about 10 to about 100 MPa (T>Tg), a Tg less than about 120Â° C., e.g., from about 40 to about 80Â° C., a molecular weight that may be as high as 3,500,000 (or higher) and an Mc (critical Mw at which Tg is nearly constant with increasing Mw) greater than about 5, and a friction coefficient less than about 1.
    In some embodiments, the amount of the maleic acid copolymer generally ranges from about greater than 0 (e.g., about 0.01%) to about 12%, and in some embodiments from greater than 0 to about 8%, and in some embodiments from greater than 0 to about 6%, and in some other embodiments from about 0% to about 4%, on a dry weight basis, based on the total weight of the composition.
 The Polyamine
   Polyamines useful in the practice of the present invention include polyamino acids and aminated polysaccharides.
    Representative examples of polyamino acids include polyamino acids such as polyaspartic acid, polylysine (p, poly-D-lysine), poly-ornithine, polyhomoarginine, polyarginine, poly-glutamic acid and polyhistidine. In some embodiments, the polyamino acid may be a homo- or a copolymer of cationic amino acid monomers, e.g., poly(lysine/ornithine), or a copolymer composed of amino acid monomers and a different monomer. In some embodiments, the polylysine used is E-Poly-L-lysine (available commercially from JNC America under the tradename PL-25 (E-POLYLYSINE 25% SOLUTION), which is used as a natural preservative in food products, and is safe and non-ecotoxic and may reduce/eliminate preservation in water-based hair styling products. Furthermore, it may reduce/eliminate some cationic conditioning polymers based on use specifications and specific needs. The molecular weight of the polyamino acid generally ranges from about 4700 to about 300,000, or greater.
    The polyamine may also be an aminated polysaccharide such as chitosan (known in the art as a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed Î²-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit), or a cosmetically acceptable derivative thereof (e.g., carboxylate, succinamide, etc). Chitosan may be obtained from various sources such as shells and vegetables. Among these compounds, commercially available sources of chitosan include chitosan having a degree of deacetylation of 90.5% by weight, available from Aber Technologies under the tradename KYTAN BRUT STANDARDÂ®, KYATMERÂ® PC (chitosan pyrrolidone-carboxylate, available from Amerchol), and VelsanÂ® Soft (chemical name: chitosan succinamide) and Zenvivvâ¢ and Zenvivoâ¢ Aqua, all available from Clariant/Kitozyme.

    The ratio of the maleic acid copolymer to the polyamine generally ranges from about from 1/10 to 10,000/1, and in some embodiments from about 1/1 to 500/1 g/g maleic acid copolymer. In yet other embodiments, the ratio is about 0.003-0.20 g/g maleic polymer). Aside from their effectiveness in imparting or maintaining shape of the hair, the relatively low amounts of the polymers allow for flexibility in formulation and cost optimization.
    The inventive compositions also contain a neutralizer, which affects pH of the composition so as to allow the maleic acid/anhydride copolymer to remain solubilized. Representative examples of neutralizers useful for this purpose include AMP (aminomethyl propanol), AMPD (aminomethyl propanediol), TIPA (triisopropanol amine), Sodium/Potassium hydroxides, Dimethylsterarylamine, Dimethyl/tallowamine lysine, ornithine, arginine, glutamic and aspartic acid.

The amount of neutralizer is selected on criteria that include the desired pH of the composition, which generally ranges from about 3 to about 9, and in some embodiments, from about 4.5 to about 8. Thus, the amount of neutralizer generally ranges from greater than 0 (e.g., about 0.01%) to about 3%, and in some embodiments from greater than 0% to about 2%, by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.
    The compositions of the present invention also contain water, the amount of which varies depending for example, on the type of composition being formulated. Thus, the amount of water generally ranges from about 0.01 to about 99%, and in some embodiments from about 0.01% to about 45%, and in some other embodiments from about 0.01% to about 40%, by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.
    Broadly, cosmetic compositions of the present invention fall into two general categories, namely aqueous-based compositions wherein water is present as a sole solvent (e.g., an aqueous solution or aqueous gel) or in combination with at least one water-miscible volatile organic solvent such as ethanol (e.g., an aqueous/alcoholic solution), and multi-phasic compositions such as emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water (O/W), water-in-oil (W/O) or multiple (triple: W/O/W or O/W/O) emulsions). Emulsions contain two or more phases which in addition to the aqueous phase include an oil-phase (that typically contains a liquid fatty phase and/or a fatty substance that is at least partially solid at room temperature (20Â° C.-25Â° C.)), wherein the discrete (e.g., continuous and discontinuous) phases are dispersible by the presence of an emulsifier or other cosmetic ingredient with emulsifying properties.
