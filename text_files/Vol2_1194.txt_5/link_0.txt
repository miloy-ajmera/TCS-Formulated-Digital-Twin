February 2023|Personal Care|The jar is open, the cream shines and exudes a pleasant scent. Now comes the moment of truth which decides whether you like it or not, whether it's a one-off purchase or a new favourite product. How does the cream feel?

January 2023|Personal Care|Do you remember the "10 Step Korean Skin Care Routine"? The ten steps promise great results, but above all they cost a lot of time in the morning and evening.

August 2022|Personal Care|Why only wish your partner and colleagues “good morning”? – wish yourself one too! With a refreshing and motivating routine right after getting up. Freshly squeezed orange juice or rather a strong coffee ...? And the right body and face care is an absolute must. This should be fun but not too time consuming either − after all, who has time in the morning? This is exactly why we have developed four revitalizing formulations, two of which we would like to present in this article. In addition to our versatile evergreens, our Day Dreaming Kit also includes all the ingredients needed to create and experience these formulations.

Our products SOFTISAN® 649 and SOFTISAN® conditionHAIR are ideal companions for the time in the sun (and of course also before and after).Read More   SheEnvisions – How our Marble Kiss Lipstick became „La Cameroonaise”By Aurélien Tahon|2022-03-29T14:12:23+02:0015. March 2022|Personal Care|Current global events show how valuable and important it is that there are people who, full of devotion and charity, want to make our earth a little bit better. One of these fascinating people is the young Cameroonian Ingrid, who worked in our IOI CARE Studio as a working student. When she learned from us how theoretical chemistry is applied in practice, she came up with the idea of imparting this knowledge in Cameroon to students, who have only few opportunities to use their knowledge. Today we would like to introduce you to the "SheEnvisions" project, which was launched together with the non-profit organization "Sustainable Growth Projects".Read More   Design Your Perfect Texture in Three Easy StepsBy Insa Waller|2022-03-04T15:28:43+01:0023.
