# Recipe Template Generator

## Description
This program takes recipe and solubility data as inputs and generates recipe templates for a product type based on the functionality of its ingredients and solubility data. The functionality of ingredients is generated by LlamaIndex QA model with documents from top 5 webpages from Google Search results. The output recipe templates include information of product type, functionality, phase, weight proportion range, confidence points range, and source links.

## Environent Variables
* `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Google service.
* `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`: Your Google Customer Search Engine ID.
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key for the OpenAI service.

### How to get your Google API key and CSE ID?
1. Set up a Custom Search Engine (CSE) by following these steps: <br>
    i. Go to the [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/) page. <br>
    ii. Click "Get Started" and follow the instructions to create a new search engine. <br>
    iii. During setup, you can choose to search specific sites or the entire web. <br>
    iv. Once your search engine is created, take note of the Search Engine ID.
2. Get your API key: <br>
    i. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/?pli=1). <br>
    ii. Select or create a project. <br>
    iii. Navigate to the "Credentials" tab and create a new API key.

### How to get your OpenAI API key?
1. Visit https://openai.com/blog/openai-api and click on the ‘Sign Up’ button.
2. Create your account on Open AI by entering your email and password.
3. After creating your account, you would have received an email on the registered email address requesting you to verify your email address. Verify your Open AI email by pressing the ‘Verify email address’ button in the email received. 
4. Once you press the ‘Verify email address’ button, your email address would be verified and you will be directed to the ‘Tell us about you’ page where you need to enter your basic information followed by a phone number. You will be required to later verify your phone number.
5. Once you verify your phone number, you will be directed to Open AI’s platform (https://platform.openai.com/).
6. On the top right corner, press ‘Personal’ -> ‘View API keys’ -> ‘USER’ -> ‘API keys’ -> ‘+ Create new secret key’.
7. Enter a name for the secret key if you wish and press ‘Create secret key’.
Copy and store the key that is displayed. Usually it starts with ‘sk-’. This key is your Open AI’s API key.

### Set environment variables
`$ export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"` <br>
`$ export GOOGLE_CSE_ID="your_cse_id"` <br>
`$ export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"`

## Command Line Arguments
For example: <br>
`$ python main.py input_recipe_file.csv input_solubility_file.xlsx --no-download`

* `input_recipe_file`: The path to the input recipe file (required)
* `input_solubility_file`: The path to the input solubility file (required)
* `--no-download`: Skip the downloading step if Google Search resulted webpages are already downloaded (optional)
## Usage
To use, run the following command: <br>
`$ python main.py recipe_clean.csv solubility_data.xlsx`

* Note:
  Solubility points can be customized by changing the number in water_solubility_points dictionary. (line 19 - 29 in `main.py`)
